            <p>Our Biodiversity and Conservation Science report for 2022-23 highlights once again our delivery of the government&rsquo;s commitment to build and share biodiversity knowledge to support conservation and nature-based tourism in Western Australia. This is achieved through world-class applied science that informs conservation and management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>
<p>Our consolidated &nbsp;Biodiversity and Conservation Science function continues to support business areas across the agency to achieve the department&rsquo;s Strategic Directions 2022-2025 by providing scientific excellence to support biodiversity conservation and nature-based tourism.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science provides innovative science through the technical expertise and capability of our science staff and the excellent support of our administration staff. The challenges we are facing as a society are impacting all of us and &nbsp;our staff continue to show their professionalism in the face of ongoing challenges. Our Conservation Science Forum in June focused on recognising and developing our people and knowledge leadership capabilities, fostering inclusion and diversity, supporting each other particularly when things seem overwhelming, and bringing open mindsets to maximise our collaborative and innovative approaches while celebrating how science supports delivery of key priorities of the department. I continue to be enormously proud of the Biodiversity and Conservation Science team and what we achieve together and with our partners.</p>
<p>Our collaborative and innovative science supports the current priorities of the department in providing knowledge and advice for delivering Plan for Our Parks, the Aboriginal Ranger program, joint management arrangements, response to climate change and renewed forest management. Other highlights of our scientific achievements this year include developing new remote area mangrove monitoring methods for use in the Kimberley Marine Parks; understanding the relationship between soil depth and tolerance to drought in jarrah; the first translocations of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo back to Two Peoples Bay National Park; the first listing of threatened ecological communities under the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>; resolving the hybrid status of two threatened eucalypt species; the first successful captive breeding of the Critically Endangered hairy marron; establishing a &lsquo;living seawalls&rsquo; trial in the Swan River; ingesting more than 2.8 million biodiversity recordsinto Dandjoo; conducting the first in-water coral and fish surveys at Bardi Jawi Garri Marine Park; and undertaking the largest threatened orchid translocation project in WA.</p>
<p>The Conferences of the Parties for Climate and Biological Diversity continue to identify the combined challenges of climate change and biodiversity decline, and the innovative science required to assist society in addressing these issues. We have new resources to work on these areas through a Climate Adaptation initiative, a changed focus on forest management in a drying climate, science to implement the Feral Cat Strategy, and biodiversity and spatial data to contribute to effective regional planning under the Native Vegetation Policy.</p>
<p>Our work is strengthened by our collaborations and partnerships both internally and externally. We continue to work collectively with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and Rottnest Island. We engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the National Environmental Science Program hubs. Co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students is evidence of our wide ranging science partnerships and we value these opportunities to work with and inspire the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage with all our partners to provide scientific excellence to support the department&rsquo;s functions and contribute to delivery of the biodiversity science priorities for Western Australia. The scientific information we generate and the biodiversity knowledge we provide is fundamental to ensuring the unique biodiversity we have around us is conserved, valued and appreciated through our natural attractions.</p>

                                    Applied research undertaken by the Animal Science Program seeks to understand the factors and processes critical for conserving Western Australia's rich and unique native fauna. The major objectives of the program are to ensure the persistence of threatened species through local and landscape-scale management actions, including reducing key threats such as predation by foxes and feral cats, inappropriate fire regimes, competition and predation by introduced rodents on islands, as well as assessing cane toad impacts and reconstructing the fauna of rangeland and arid areas.

                                                <p>Barrow Island Nature Reserve is one of Australia's most important conservation reserves, particularly for mammal and marine turtle conservation. It has also been the site of a producing oil field since 1964. In 2003, the Western Australian Government approved the development of the Gorgon gas field off the north west of Barrow Island and associated LNG plant on Barrow Island subject to several environmental offset conditions. One of these offsets was the threatened and priority fauna translocation program that provided for the translocation of selected Barrow Island fauna species to other secure island and mainland sites. This will assist in improving the conservation status of these species and allow the reconstruction of the fauna in some areas. It also provides an opportunity to examine the factors affecting translocation success and improve these where necessary. Targeted species are the golden bandicoot, brushtail possum, spectacled hare-wallaby, boodie, black and white fairy-wren, and spinifex bird.</p>

<p>Spatio-temporal landscape genetics, combined with Species Distribution Modelling (SDM), offers a novel approach to multi-species conservation planning. This project will provide current and historical insight into how small-medium sized mammals use the Pilbara landscape, providing information for conversation actions and habitat management. Therefore, this project is significant in bringing together key government and industry stakeholders engaged in conservation management in the Pilbara. Furthermore, the framework developed for integrating these findings into conservation priorities will be applicable for conservation management, globally.</p>

<li class="p1">Based on the core habitat of 19 species (identified with SDM), maps of species richness were generated for the Pilbara. Three guilds of small-medium-sized mammal species were identified, reflecting species with preferences for rocky habitat, high aridity, or spinifex and weathered areas. This work is in preparation for publication.</li>
<li>Genetically informed connectivity modelling across eight small-medium-sized mammal species was completed, revealing that dispersal in rocky specialists was less restricted than for generalists and sand specialists across the Pilbara landscape. For the latter, the Fortescue Marsh is a major dispersal corridor.</li>
<li>A landscape and population genetics paper on Pilbara northern quolls (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) was published in the journal <em>Conservation Biology</em>, and provides tools for conservation decision-making.</li>
<li>A comparative landscape genetics paper on three Pilbara small mammal species that evaluates different statistical approaches and genetic marker types to provide methodological guidance was published in the journal<em> Ecology and Evolution</em>.</li>

<li>Identification of environmental variables that underpin core habitat for Pilbara small-medium-sized mammal guilds is providing insight into species ecology and enables conservation efforts to be guided toward areas that benefit multiple species.</li>
<li>The Fortescue Marsh is indicated as a major dispersal corridor for generalist and sand specialist small-medium sized mammals suggesting targeted conservation efforts in this region will assist in maintaining connectivity and gene flow amongst populations of these species.</li>
<li>The generation of high-resolution genetic data for eleven mammal species, including four EPBC-listed threatened species, has assisted in the detection of historical refugia, key dispersal corridors, genetic diversity hotspots and potentially locally adapted populations that may act as foci for conservation protection.</li>
<li>The spatial-genetic maps generated in this project are being made available to a range of end users to assist in various conservation-related activities, including assessment of development impacts in the Pilbara, survey planning for conservation translocations and fire management.</li>

Increases in threats, including pressure from mining activities across the Pilbara mean that a greater understanding of the distribution, abundance and ecology of the bilby is necessary to ensure appropriate conservation and management measures are implemented. This project aims to increase our knowledge of the bilby in the Pilbara bioregion of Western Australia, and develop a regional survey and monitoring program. The current focus is to determine the distribution of the bilby in the Pilbara and to establish appropriate survey and monitoring techniques, including genetic approaches.</p>

<li>Bilby abundance monitoring near the Warralong community in the Pilbara continued in conjunction with Eradicat&reg; feral cat baiting trials. Ongoing monitoring is required to determine if baiting is effective in reducing feral cat activity, and leads to a positive effect on bilby abundance.</li>
<li>Preliminary results from an analysis investigating the influence of fire attributes on bilby occurrence in the Pilbara suggest that bilby occupancy decreases with increasing spatial extent of recently burnt habitat in the surrounding landscape, and increases with pyrodiversity (diversity of fire ages).</li>
<li>A complementary project on the Dampier Peninsula in the Kimberley showed that bilby occupancy increased with increasing spatial extent of surrounding long unburnt habitat (greater than 3 years old), while feral cat occupancy declined. Similarly, frequent fires tended to deter bilbies but not feral cats.</li>
<li>A review of the bilby research program was completed, with future research directions and management actions identfied. </li>

Development of an effective landscape-scale baiting technique, and the incorporation of a suitable toxin for feral cats, is cited as a high priority in the various iterations of the national <em>Threat abatement plan for predation of feral cats</em>, as it is most likely to yield a practical, effective, and cost-efficient method to control feral cat numbers in strategic areas and promote the recovery of threatened fauna.</p>

<li>Field trials commenced to examine coating of baits with an attractant to improve palatability. These trials are showing considerable promise and will continue, across four biomes, in spring and autumn for the next two years.</li>
<li>Trials to monitor cat activity and movement patterns, using satellite radio-collars, are underway at several sites (Avon Valley/Walyunga National Parks and Francois Peron National Park) to inform targeted bait delivery during future landscape-scale aerial baiting campaigns. This information will be used to increase likely bait encounter rate when cats are hungry and result in improved baiting efficacy.</li>
<li>A number of novel lures (including dispensing units) are being tested for their utility as attractants to monitor cat abundance and enable reliable and repeatable measurement of control efficacy. This research includes collaborative work with Murdoch University on an &lsquo;Artificial Intelligence&rsquo; remote camera system.</li>

                                                <p>The Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological Restoration Project aims to restore the ecological condition of Western Australia's largest island to that seen by Dirk Hartog when he landed on the island in 1616. The establishment of populations of 12 mammal and one bird species on Dirk Hartog Island (DHI) over a 12-year period is a key part of this project. Of these species, one is listed as critically endangered, one as endangered and six as vulnerable under the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>. The other three species are either conservation dependent or near threatened. Their successful re-establishment will contribute to improving the overall conservation status of these species. The translocation of 13 native species to an island 633 square km in area makes it the largest fauna reconstruction project in Australia and one of the largest in the world. For successful re-establishment to occur, sheep, feral goats, and feral cats have been removed. The eradication of feral cats represents the most extensive eradication program achieved globally. Genetic information on source populations is being used to inform founder selection, genetic monitoring of released animals, and ongoing management practices.</p>

                                                <p>The heath mouse <em>Pseudomys shortridgei</em> (50-80g) is one of several native rodent species that have declined in distribution and abundance since European colonisation. Originally collected in 1906 near Pingelly in WA&rsquo;s wheatbelt, the heath mouse was thought to be extinct in WA until its rediscovery in 1987. Until 2019, the last confirmed record of the heath mouse in WA was in 2004, from Lake Magenta. Targeted surveys in 2019 resulted in their detection at two locations, confirming that the heath mouse was still extant in WA. Further surveys in 2020 failed to detect the species despite sampling in areas where they had previously been recorded. As there is evidence of a significant decline in the distribution and abundance, further targeted survey is critical to determine the current conservation status of the species in WA and inform recovery action.</p>

Funding from mining offset conditions is being used to gain a better understanding of quoll distribution, ecology, demographics and management requirements in the Pilbara. The two major components of the project are monitoring and ecological research. Survey and monitoring of Pilbara northern quoll populations over 10+ years will provide a regional context for understanding population dynamics. Researching northern quoll ecology will provide information related to impacts, such as loss of known or potential habitat critical to the survival of the species, loss of known or potential foraging/dispersal habitat, and barriers restricting dispersal opportunities and genetic flow.</p>

<li>A review of the northern quoll research program, published in <em>Australian Mammalogy</em>, found that the program has substantially improved our knowledge of Pilbara northern quolls, particularly in relation to effective survey and monitoring techniques, the influence of habitat quantity, configuration, and composition on occupancy, movement ecology, population dynamics and structure, and the threat posed by introduced predators.</li>
<li>An analysis of northern quoll fine-scale habitat, published in <em>Australian Mammalogy</em>, found that quolls selected habitats that were topographically rugged, and characterised by a higher percentage cover of rocky habitat and riverbed, and a lower percentage cover of spinifex sandplain.</li>
<li>An analysis comparing the efficiency of new (camera traps) and conventional (live trapping) survey methods in terms of cost and statistical power in tracking occupancy declines in northern quolls, published in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>, indicated that camera traps can detect declines of 30%, 50% and 80% at a reduced cost when compared to live trap designs, without compromising statistical power.</li>
<li>A complementary paper published in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>, discussed the implementation of improved quoll monitoring methods and the benefits associated with involving local stakeholders.</li>
<li>An analysis exploring the relationship between northern quoll habitat suitability and mean population fitness, published in <em>Wildlife Research,</em> indicated that mean population fitness increased with increasing habitat suitability, increasing topographic ruggedness, annual rainfall, rainfall variability, and decreasing distance to water.</li>
<li>Northern quolls were detected on the Burrup Peninsula for the first time in almost 10 years, as part of collaborative monitoring efforts with the Murujuga Rangers.</li>

Monitoring programs that effectively track population trends allow for timely responses to any significant declines or changes.</li>
<li>Identification of the importance of topographically rugged habitat, as well as linear features, such as creek beds for northern quolls, informs management strategies that protect these preferred habitats and provide benefits to the species.</li>
<li>Engaging local stakeholders strengthens DBCA's capacity to monitor northern quolls effectively at scale in the Pilbara, and increased the capacity of Indigenous ranger groups to undertake their own monitoring of other culturally significant fauna.</li>

                                                <p>The Pilbara olive python (<em>Liasis olivaceus barroni) </em>is a threatened species confined to the Pilbara and adjacent northern part of the Gascoyne IBRA region. Little is known about its ecology, habitat preferences and conservation threats. It is an introduced predator consuming a diet of large birds, reptiles and mammals as an adult, including other threatened species such as northern quolls. A number of potential threats confront Pilbara olive pythons, but their relative importance is not understood. They include the loss of important prey items due to exotic predators; habitat loss and modification from mining activities and infrastructure development; and on a local scale, increases in road kills by vehicular traffic due to resource projects and tourism. The project will resolve some of the unknown life history parameters important for conservation of this species and for effective population monitoring. In particular, research will focus on important habitat elements, the reproductive cycle of the species and the predation of juvenile snakes.</p>

                                                <p>Feral cats are one of the most significant threats to native terrestrial vertebrate species in Australia. The Felixer&trade; cat grooming trap is a novel method of controlling feral cats that takes advantage of their compulsive grooming behaviour. The Felixer unit detects the presence of a feral cat and sprays a lethal dose of 1080 toxic gel onto the fur of the feral cat. The feral cat instinctively grooms itself to remove the gel and, in doing so, ingests a lethal dose of the poison. The unit takes a photograph every time the detection beams are crossed, allowing an assessment of the efficacy of the trap in differentiating feral cats from non-target species.</p>
<p>Proper testing of this new technology is essential to validate if the Felixer is an effective and low-risk feral cat management tool and at what scale they are most effective. This project is a research trial to assess the effectiveness of these traps to deliver feral cat control at a meso-spatial scale (around 10,000 ha) for threatened fauna conservation and recovery. The trials are being conducted in high conservation value areas in and around the Tone-Perup Nature Reserve and the Lake Muir-Byenup Ramsar site.</p>

                                                <p>Genetic analysis of threatened species can provide important information to support and guide conservation management. Genetic information can aid resolution of the taxonomic identity of species and sub-species to determine whether they have appropriate conservation listing. At a population level, analysis of the genetic diversity present, and its distribution across extant populations, provides information on the genetic 'health' of threatened species. Concurrent analysis of some of the proximal drivers of genetic change can identify appropriate management responses for declining populations to improve conservation outcomes. Further, emerging genomic technologies enable novel monitoring approaches, expanding the available toolbox for threatened species monitoring. </p>

                                                <p>The orange leaf-nosed bat (<em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em>) and the ghost bat (<em>Macroderma gigas</em>) were both once widespread across Australia but are now restricted to patchily distributed habitat across northern Australia. Isolated populations occur in the Pilbara bioregion, where a distinct form of the orange leaf-nosed bat is recognised (hereafter Pilbara leaf-nosed bat). Both species are considered to be declining in the Pilbara, being highly threatened by habitat loss through mining activity, and are consequently recognised as Vulnerable under State and Commonwealth environmental legislation. Genetic analyses are providing insight into landscape-scale and fine-scale patterns of genetic structure and connectivity in these species. The development of novel genetic techniques for non-invasive monitoring of ghost bats is providing rich insights into roost occupancy patterns and animal movement. Further research is required to address priority knowledge gaps for the species, including estimation of population size and identification and characterisation of critical habitat for each species.</p>

                                                <p>The invasion of cane toads is impacting the biodiversity of the Kimberley, and no technique has been developed to prevent their spread across the landscape. Earlier research has identified that predators, such as northern quolls (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) and goannas, are especially vulnerable to poisoning by toads and that it is possible to train some native predators to avoid eating cane toads. A taste aversion bait to prevent quolls eating toads has been developed and is being trialled during this project. Monitoring of northern quoll and reptile populations on Adolphus Island and mainland sites is required to understand how these species are likely to respond to the arrival of toads on islands.</p>

<li>Trials of DBCA conditioned taste aversion baits resulted in equivocal results, with small numbers of quolls persisting on both control and treatment sites after the arrival of cane toads. The differences are being carefully teased out using video and camera footage to understand how quolls interact with the baits.</li>
<li>CTA baits were found to be effective at inducing quoll avoidance of the baits and toad legs. Results from this work and research by others suggests that quolls do not remember their taste aversion experience for a long period (weeks). Therefore, it is important that aerial drops of CTA baits occur both early, and at other times in the wet season, so that quolls have likely encountered a CTA bait a short time before they meet their first toad.</li>

                                                <p>The use of camera traps is often regarded as an effective tool for fauna survey and monitoring with the assumption that they provide high-quality, cost-effective data. Nevertheless, understanding of appropriate methods for general survey and species detection, particularly in the small to medium sized range of mammals, remains poor. Within the department, the use of camera traps to date has usually been restricted to simple species inventories or behavioural studies, and beyond this, there has been little assessment of deployment methods or appropriate analytical techniques. This has sometimes limited the usefulness of data derived from captured images. Camera traps have the potential to offer a comparatively reliable and relatively unbiased method for monitoring medium to large native and introduced mammal species throughout the state, including several significant cryptic species that are currently not incorporated under the Western Shield fauna monitoring program. Further research is required to validate and assess the temporal and spatial components of different survey designs, methods of deploying camera traps and interpretation of results to determine how best to use remote cameras to provide rigorous data on species detectability and species richness and density.</p>

Information to date has largely been captured using Western Shield monitoring, and while this has provided some data for selected locations, the monitoring sites and methods used are designed to capture information on a range of species. Consequently, captures of chuditch are often sparse and monitoring is not comprehensive across its distribution. Analysis of Western Shield data suggests that there has been a significant decline in the relative abundance of chuditch in the period 2013-17, although inconsistent trap effort in some years may have confounded this result. Further analyses suggested that the currently sparse data could not provide reliable population size estimates for the species. This project will undertake targeted surveys in poorly sampled areas to fill information gaps using an approach specific to chuditch. Concurrent DNA sampling will improve an understanding of the genetic structure across the entire species range. The information gained will help to inform decisions both in relation to the effective conservation management of chuditch, as well as sourcing animals for translocations to ensure newly established populations are genetically diverse and representative of the species.</p>

<li>Sites were surveyed within the South Coast, Goldfields, Swan, Warren, Wheatbelt and South West regions.</li>
<li>Captures continued to be significantly higher using chicken instead of universal bait.</li>
<li>Chuditch were detected at Ravensthorpe, Tone-Perup, Dryandra, Batalling, Avon, Centaur, Catterick, Lake Magenta and Jarrahdale, but not at Cocanarup or Dragon Rocks.</li>
<li>Lake Magenta and Ravensthorpe yielded the lowest captures (1 and 5 captures in 500 trap nights, respectively), and Dryandra the highest with 58 captures in 400 trap nights.</li>
<li>Camera traps were established at Jaurdi Station and at Helena and Aurora Ranges to determine if longer term monitoring assists in detecting chuditch.</li>
<li>Tissue samples for genetic analyses were collected at all sites with chuditch captures except Jarrahdale.</li>
<li>Tissue samples from 255 individuals were sequenced using samples collected primarily from 2021-2022 monitoring but also included some historical samples from the Goldfields, South Coast regions and those collected from translocated populations. Fitzgerald River National Park population had the greatest genetic differentiation.</li>
<li>The use of a camera trap approach to monitoring chuditch continues to be investigated.</li>

                                                <p>Operation Rangelands Restoration commenced in 2000 with the acquisition of Lorna Glen (Matuwa) and Earaheedy (Kurrara Kurrara) ex-pastoral leases by the WA Government, that were made a National Park in 2023. We are working in collaboration with the traditional owners, Tarlka Matuwa Piarku Aboriginal Corporation, who were granted exclusive native title over the area in 2014, to restore ecosystem function and biodiversity in the rangelands. Matuwa once supported many mammal species, that have suffered large declines. This project seeks to reintroduce 11 arid zone mammal species following the successful suppression of feral cats and foxes. Mammal reconstruction will also contribute to the restoration of rangeland ecosystems through re-establishment of ecosystem services such as digging, grazing/browsing of vegetation and seed dispersal. The first mammal reintroductions commenced in August 2007 with the release of bilby (<em>Macrotis lagotis</em>) and brushtail possums (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>). Between 2010-2012, mala (<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>), Shark Bay mice (<em>Pseudomys fieldi</em>), boodies (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) and golden bandicoots (<em>Isoodon auratus</em>) were translocated into a 1100 hectare introduced predator-free fenced enclosure. The enclosure is intended to provide species with an opportunity to acclimatise to the desert environment. The ultimate goal is to release animals outside the enclosure and establish free-ranging, self sustaining populations of these species.</p>

The key sites selected were South Coast reserves, Upper Warren reserves, Dryandra Woodland and Kalbarri National Park.</p>
<p>This project is a component of the SWTFRP, focussing on the southern jarrah forest, which is an important area for the conservation of several mammal and bird species threatened by introduced predators. To date there has been no effective cat control within the southern jarrah forest, including the priority conservation areas within the Upper Warren region. Eradicat&reg; presents an opportunity for developing an important tool within an effective cat control program that is essential to the long-term conservation of imperilled fauna threatened by introduced predators.</p>

                                                <p>Carpet pythons are predators of multiple threatened mammal fauna, including the critically endangered Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo (<em>Potorous gilberti</em>). Python predation can reduce adult survival and curtail recruitment. Current 'predator proof' fences, while effective at reducing or eliminating predation by foxes and feral cats, are likely to have little or no effect on levels of python predation.</p>
<p>Python predation has been identified as a significant threat to the Gilbert's potoroo population in the Waychinicup National Park enclosure. In a review of options following the 2015 fire that impacted the only known wild population at Two Peoples Bay, it was considered that management intervention is required to reduce python predation of potoroos within the enclosure. Python predation may be limiting population growth and hence the production of individuals for translocation.</p>

                                                <p>The Biodiversity Information Office (BIO) has developed Dandjoo, a central platform that makes Western Australian biodiversity data more easily discoverable, searchable, and accessible. Dandjoo was launched in mid-2022, and is being enhanced with a range of new features and refinements during 2022-23 and 2023-24. It has been designed to mobilise biodiversity data from all environment-related sectors, including industry, government and community organisations, and to support seamless data sharing across the public, private and research sectors and the broader community.</p>
<p>This work will drive improved regulatory decision‑making, providing data for the State&rsquo;s forthcoming Environment Online portal to support digital transformation of environmental assessment and approval, and to other State agencies to support evidence-based decision-making for better environmental outcomes.  It also facilitates the automated exchange of biodiversity data between Western Australia and the Commonwealth to support decision-making at a national level.</p>

BIO is initially focusing on high volume, high quality datasets, particularly those that are not easily accessible at present, driving a step-change in the availability of biodiversity data in Western Australia.  The data is ingested into the platform after passing automated quality assurance checks, where it is mapped to the Darwin Core biodiversity data standard and undergoes a human‑mediated quality control process before being released to users. </p>
<p>The initial datasets ingested into BIO's Dandjoo biodiversity data sharing platform have been sourced directly from industry, DBCA repositories, the Western Australian Museum, and regulators such as the Department of Water and the Environment (DWER). New data will continually be ingested, through future automated delivery from regulators and BIO's rolling program to identify and source other valuable datasets.  This data collation program will involve outreach to data custodians across all sectors, exploration of technologies to unlock data in pre‑digital documents and ongoing monitoring of existing data to identify temporal and spatial gaps.</p>

                                    Applied research undertaken by the Ecosystem Science Program seeks to understand the environmental, ecological and biogeographical processes that determine the conservation values, health and productivity of the lands and inland waters managed by the department. The program's research examines the spatial and temporal distribution of the State's biodiversity, and how ecosystems function and respond to threatening processes and management.Biogeographic studies provide information on the composition of communities and distribution of the State's flora and fauna at scales relevant to management questions. Survey data provide the foundation for a range of management activities, including conservation estate planning, assessing the conservation status of species and communities and predicting the impacts of other land uses and threats.The program investigates how ecosystems function and respond to water and land resource management practices and to broadscale threats including salinity, altered hydrology, climate change and habitat fragmentation. Projects include investigations into the nature of threats and monitoring associated ecological responses and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The program also investigates genetic diversity, evolutionary history and ecological plasticity of plant populations to guide vegetation management.The program collaborates with other parts of the department, museums and herbaria, universities, cooperative research centres, natural resource management groups, CSIRO and other research providers. Partnerships also exist with traditional owners, resource companies and the environmental consulting industry.

                                                <p>Changes in the hydrology of Toolibin Lake and the Lake Bryde catchments, due to land clearing, have resulted in these previously ephemeral freshwater wetlands developing a connection with deeper, saline groundwater and becoming degraded. A decline in average rainfall since the 1970s has seen a further decrease in wetland health as surface water flows and wetland hydroperiods decrease in quantity and quality. Robust management decisions require the main hydrological driver(s) of change to be identified and spatial and temporal fluxes (water and solutes) to be characterised. This project will significantly advance hydrological studies at Toolibin Lake and Lake Bryde by making full use of the data collection and analyses undertaken to date to produce practical tools for answering the key hydrological management questions.</p>

                                                <p>Ecological monitoring is a key element of adaptive conservation management, but can be resource intensive. In recent years, techniques such as camera traps, audio recorders and satellite tracking have improved effectiveness of monitoring programs. Metabarcoding and environmental DNA (eDNA) are emerging technologies that may be used to enhance environmental monitoring. While no single tool can provide all the information necessary for monitoring, eDNA has some advantages over other methods in some situations. For example, significant taxonomic expertise is often required to identify taxa, especially invertebrates, but such expertise can be difficult to obtain. Additionally, some existing methods are not ideal for detecting elusive or poorly known taxa and can be laborious. eDNA may overcome some of these limitations, and this project examines how eDNA can be effectively used as a monitoring tool, complementing existing methods and projects for biodiversity conservation.</p>

<li>Results of these projects will help inform how eDNA can be applied in future monitoring projects.</li>
<li>The development of standard protocols for eDNA collection, extraction and sequencing could contribute to standardisation across the department and potentially other agencies as this approach starts to be implemented.</li>
<li>The development of reference barcode libraries will improve species discovery, knowledge of species' ranges and ecological requirements and provide greater understanding of ecosystem conservation values.</li>
<li>Thinning of stand density in the Yarrigil catchments does not affect soil microbiome composition below and between trees, suggesting that range of jarrah forest soil processes may not be affected by thinning, but the open space microbiome will expand as the canopy opens.</li>
<li>eDNA has been added to the cane toad detection toolkit and is being used at the invasion front.</li>

<li>FORESTCHECK has provided a systematic framework for evaluating the effects of silvicultural practices across a range of forest types and provided a sound basis for adaptive management.</li>
<li>The project has demonstrated that harvesting had no impact on richness of most biological groups, but richness of cryptogams was higher in unharvested sites in the first monitoring round and richness of ground-dwelling vertebrates was higher in harvested sites in both rounds. Harvesting did not affect the composition of most biological assemblages, except that bird and cryptogam communities differed between unharvested and some harvested sites.</li>
<li>Findings from the project continue to inform a variety of forest management policies and practices and contributed to a revision of silvicultural guidance documents and development of the draft Forest Management Plan 2024-2033 .</li>
<li>The network of FORESTCHECK grids provides a framework for monitoring responses to disturbance events such as bushfires and extreme droughts, effects of stand density, and examining the impacts of a changing climate over the longer term.</li>
<li>eDNA may provide an efficient tool for monitoring forest biodiversity and health.</li>

<li>Comparative analysis of two small <em>Acacia</em> shrubs with patchy distributions, <em>Acacia hilliana</em> and <em>A. spondylophylla, </em>show genetic differentiation among populations indicating some restrictions to gene flow in contrast to the widespread gene flow in the tree species. These results have been published in the journal <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>.</li>
<li>Analysis of the small shrub <em>Mirbelia viminalis</em> shows genetic diversity similar to other widespread Pilbara species and genetic differentiation among populations, indicating some restrictions to gene flow as found for other Pilbara species of low stature. A paper has been published in the <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>.</li>
<li>Analysis of two widespread shrubs, <em>Petalostylis labicheoides</em> and <em>Indigofera monophylla,</em> showed higher genetic diversity in <em>I. monophylla</em> than in <em>P. labicheoides</em>, and slightly higher diversity was located in the Hamersley Ranges for both species. A divergent lineage of <em>P. labicheoides</em> was detected in the northeast Pilbara, and some structure in <em>I. monophylla</em> indicated higher levels of range-wide differentiation in these shrubs compared to widespread trees. This comparative analysis has been published in the journal <em>Annals of Botany</em>.</li>
<li>Analysis of genetic diversity in <em>Senna glutinosa</em> subsp. <em>glutinosa </em>found very high levels of clonality within populations, and further analysis of seedlings revealed many of them to have identical genotypes as their mother plant, confirming apomixis as the dominant reproductive strategy, although some sexual reproduction was evident. Apomictic clones were distributed across the Pilbara landscape with no particular geographic pattern. This evidence of long-distance seed dispersal is likely driven by water movement following cyclonic activity. A manuscript is under review in the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em>.</li>

<li>Understanding patterns of genetic diversity provides information for seed collection strategies in restoration and revegetation. Analysis of a range of species in the Pilbara provides information to support effective mine site restoration.</li>
<li>While one tree species, <em>Eucalyptus leucophloia</em>, showed a pattern of ranges in the Pilbara being refugia, other species have not. The low level of differentiation in other tree species and large shrubs, such as <em>Corymbia hamersleyana, </em><em>Acacia</em> <em>pruinocarpa</em>, <em>I. monophylla and S. glutinosa </em>subsp<em>. glutinosa </em>imply that seed resources for land rehabilitation and mine site revegetation programs for these species can be selected from a wide distributional range within the Pilbara.

<li>High genetic differentiation within species such as <em>A. hilliana</em>, <em>A. spondylophylla and</em> <em>M. viminalis </em>that have more restricted and patchy distributions indicate more limited seed collection zones are appropriate. </li>

                                                <p>Biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of ecological processes that include balances and fluxes of water, energy and biogeochemistry. These processes are considered in a number of coarse scale ecological assessment and management frameworks but these frameworks are difficult to apply at finer or local scales, where an appreciation of hydrological variation is important. To increase confidence in applying coarse scale management frameworks at finer scales, they need to be verified by results from targeted, critical, local scale ecosystem investigations. Critical ecosystem sites are selected where dominant processes driving their behaviour are complex but not unique, so that frameworks for ecosystems with similar hydrological function and response to change can be assessed. The project will investigate the hydrological function of local scale critical water dependent ecosystems, determine and improve our understanding of dominant hydrological processes controlling their physico-chemical sensitivity and responses to change, and feed the results back into coarser scale ecosystem management frameworks. Local scale sites will be selected where ecohydrological data can be collected and integrated with existing biophysical datasets and information to optimise the transferability of hydrological results and outcomes to other areas.</p>

<li>Continued monitoring of groundwater levels, streamflow, stream salinity, stream turbidity, rainfall, an automatic weather station and sap flow in Yarragil 4L, 4X, 6C, and Wuraming catchments in the Perth Hills District, 20km south of Dwellingup. This monitoring will indicate how thinning and the slow adjustment of the forest and hydrology in the decade or so post-thinning alters groundwater recharge and streamflow generation, informing riparian zone conservation, estimates of water demand by healthy thinned and unthinned forest.</li>
<li>Monitoring of sap flow paused at Yarragil 4X and 4L with an upgrade of the data logger software and will recommence in July 2023. Sap flow provides a direct measure of tree water use, and a comparison of water use by similar sized trees with similar depths to groundwater at these sites provides an improved understanding of how thinning can mitigate water stress and improve forest health.</li>
<li>A total of 2.4km of electrical resistivity geophysics surveys were conducted at Yarragil 4X and 4L which enabled imaging of soil depth and depth to bedrock in parts of these catchments. This data will be used in the future development of ecohydrological models of the catchments. These models can then be used to improve predictions of the effects of thinning on the hydrological response.</li>
<li>Soil and stem samples were retrieved from Yarragil 4x (unthinned) and 4L (thinned 2019) and submitted for water stable isotope analyses. This sampling will continue through to the summer of 2023-24. This information, together with sap flow, will help inform how tree water use changes in response to thinning. </li>

                                                <p>A decline in vegetation density in the north-east of the Forest Management Plan area was noted in <em>mid-term review of performance of the Forest Management Plan 2014-2023</em>. The decline is broadly consistent with climate change predictions, although other factors may be contributing. Previous research suggests that <em>Eucalyptus wandoo</em> has been undergoing a series of declines associated with drought and increasing temperatures, and a buprestid beetle (<em>Cisseis fascigera</em>). <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em> and <em>Corymbia calophylla</em> have been reported to be vulnerable to acute drought and heatwave events at water-shedding sites with shallow soils, as well as frost events. </p>
<p>More information is needed about the landscape, site and stand characteristics that predispose forests to decline. This project will build on the information available and investigate the contributing factors. Project results will provide a greater understanding of the vulnerability of the forest to climate change and assist in developing evidence-based management interventions.</p>

                                                <p>Lifeplan is a global biodiversity survey project funded by the European Research Council and led by the University of Helsinki. As a fundamental data platform, Lifeplan will generate standardised, global data on a range of species groups, allowing quantification of variation in ecological communities at spatial scales from 0.1 km to 10000 km across hundreds of thousands of species. This project is establishing 100 sites globally, with additional denser sampling in the Nordic countries and in Madagascar. Each of the 100+ global sites will consist of paired urban and natural locations. Perth has been selected as one of the global sites, with plots located in woodlands dominated by <em>Banksia</em> and <em>Casuarina</em> in Lowlands Nature Reserve and Kings Park. In addition to investigating global patterns in biodiversity, the project aims to scale up the use of efficient biodiversity monitoring tools (machine learning analysis of ecoacoustics and camera trapping data, and metabarcoding of aerial spores, soil fungi and flying insects). The project will be carried out over six years, with sampling alternating between the Lowlands and Kings Park locations.</p>

                                                <p>This project provides information to underpin the management of karri and jarrah regrowth stands in the immature stage of development (25-120 years old). Regenerated stands have important values for  biodiversity conservation and as a store of terrestrial carbon. Immature karri stands that regenerated following timber harvesting and bushfire comprise more than 50,000 hectares and represent around one third of the area of karri forest managed by the department. Large parts of the jarrah forest are also comprised of predominantly even-aged regrowth. There are a number of well-designed experiments that investigate the dynamics of naturally regenerated and planted stands managed at a range of stand densities. These experiments span a range of site productivity and climatic gradients and have been measured repeatedly over several decades, providing important information to support and improve management practices.</p>
<p>This project addresses emerging issues for the next decade of forest management, including climate change and declining groundwater levels, interactions with pests and pathogens, and increased recognition of the role of forests in maintaining global carbon cycles. The scope of this project has been broadened to include thinning response of even-aged jarrah stands, with all thinning experiments now covered by this single project plan.</p>

<li>Thinning concentrates the growth potential of a site onto selected trees and provides forest managers with options to manage stands for particular structural characteristics that may be important for wildlife habitat or resilience to disturbance. Thinning is an important tool for managing streamflow and groundwater levels in forested catchments in the face of a drying climate as well as maximizing growth of retained trees.  The current study indicates that stand basal area growth in even aged stands was optimised at retained basal ares of 13m<sup>2 </sup>ha<sup>-1</sup>.</li>

<li>Vehicle based spotlight monitoring of mammals on three standardised transects was conducted in Autumn (3 repeat surveys per transect). These surveys occurred immediately after a gum leaf skeletoniser outbreak that impacted approximately 100,000ha of the Upper Warren region during the summer. In some areas the outbreak has resulted in almost complete defoliation of all jarrah trees, a key source of food for ngwayir (western ringtail possum), in particular. The impacted area, includes the areas surrounding the three long-term monitoring transects in Greater Kingston. While no substantial declines were observed in the detection rates of the critically endangered ngwayir or koomal (brushtail possum) it is possible that significant declines may be observed in the coming year.</li>
<li>A pedestrian-based spotlight survey within the Perup Sanctuary was conducted in November 2022 resulted in population estimates of 156 ngwayir individuals (95% Confidence Interval 127&ndash;192) and 350 koomal individuals (95% CI 272 &ndash; 452) within the 423 hectare predator-free sanctuary. Densities of both species did not differ between areas subject to prescribed burning 5 and 22 years ago. Competition from koomal may be limiting the distribution and abundance of ngwayir. </li>

                                                <p>Taxonomic knowledge underpins effective management of aquatic invertebrate biodiversity, including spatial patterning and trends over time in relation to threats. Over half of the species are not formally described, but they are consistently named across departmental projects through maintenance of a voucher specimen collection. As opportunities and skills allow, program staff undertake systematics studies (primarily species descriptions and genetic analyses), sometimes with specialist co-authors. This allows formal naming and description of Western Australian endemics that would not otherwise occur and allows species to be consistently identified by external research groups. Tools allowing consistent identification of aquatic invertebrates will also be produced.</p>

The department coordinates documentation on the wetlands' condition and reports to the Commonwealth Government for reporting to the Ramsar Secretariat. Like many wetlands globally, Western Australia's Ramsar wetlands are threatened or currently being affected by various factors. These include water resource development, agriculture and urban development, invasive species, mining, plant diseases, salinisation, and climate change. This project aims to undertake monitoring of the State's Ramsar wetlands to improve reporting capabilities and determine efficient monitoring techniques for adaptive management programs.</p>

                                                <p>Peat wetlands are relatively rare in Western Australia but constitute an important habitat for biodiversity where they occur, especially in the far south-west of Western Australia, providing refugia from seasonal and long-term drying for a range of geographically restricted flora and fauna. This includes rare wetland dependent orchids and a total of 21 priority plant species, short-range endemic aquatic invertebrates, the threatened Australasian bittern and south-west endemic fish.</p>
<p>Some peat wetlands in the Muir-Byenup System Ramsar site wetland suite are threatened by acidification and some have already acidified due to declining groundwater levels. Drying is also making these organic wetlands more prone to catastrophic fires. The peat also can contain a range of toxic metals and metalloids that are released to the environment as they dry. The major aim of this project is to undertake a risk assessment of fire susceptibility and release of acidity and other contaminants. The project will deliver a map of the distribution of at-risk peat wetlands, combined with recommendations for fire management and maintaining water balance.</p>

                                                <p>Little is known about the effects of climate change on our forest ecosystems. A broader understanding of the range of effects that climate change has on forest ecology and functioning is required to predict how forest ecosystems will respond to a future climate and extreme weather events. By increasing our understanding, management intervention techniques may be explored that could reduce the severity of changes to forest ecosystems. The Draft Forest Management Plan 2024-2033 indicates that research will be prioritised to address knowledge gaps related to forest conservation, forest health and forest management for climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Responding to current impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity and resilience, and forecasting future impacts, will be underpinned by knowledge and understanding of mitigation and adaptation actions.</p>

<li>Examination of drought-affected northern jarrah forest sites using geophysics showed drought effects leading to lower cover by trees and shrubs in soils &lt;20 m thick and increased likelihood of drought effect in soils &lt;12m thick, while treeless areas had thin soils, &lt;2m thick. A manuscript has been submitted to<em> Ecohydrology</em>. </li>
<li>Surface fuels at the Munro ecological thinning demonstration site were collected and five different thinning treatments compared. Collection of LiDAR data via drone was also tested at Munro. Permanent plots were established, and canopy cover, and coarse and fine woody debris transects were measured at the Hamilton ecological thinning trial.</li>
<li>Examination of impacts of fruit harvesting on fruit production of <em>Banksia grandis </em>has been completed, and a final report has been written. For the three forest blocks examined, there is evidence of ample production without an obvious harvesting effect. </li>
<li>A collaborative study with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services was undertaken to examine the vulnerability of regrowth forests to high severity fire. As part of this, the 060 DBCA fire dataset is being updated. A final report is being written.</li>

This project is designed to fill gaps within and between regional surveys by providing aquatic invertebrate biodiversity data and analyses at finer scales. Recent examples of such projects are wetland surveys in the Upper Fortescue catchment in the Pilbara, Lake Carnegie and Kimberley Mound Springs.</p>

                                    The Fire Science Program seeks to inform fire management and biodiversity conservation on lands managed by the department, including state forests, national parks and other conservation reserves. The strategic goal of the program is to ensure that the best available scientific information is used for integrated fire management to protect communities and natural values. Key themes for the program include developing and validating decision support tools for fire management, and understanding the effects of fire regimes on species, ecosystems and landscapes and how these interact with threatening processes including weeds, introduced predators and climate change. Monitoring and learning from the outcomes of prescribed burns and bushfire incidents is also an important activity for the program. Strong collaborative linkages exist with universities, cooperative research centres, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, other government agencies and private sector research providers.

                                                <p>Fire management based on sound science is fundamental to the conservation of biodiversity and the protection of life and property in fire-maintained ecosystems of south-west Western Australia. There is a substantial body of scientific evidence that, within ecologically circumscribed parameters, fire diversity can benefit biodiversity at the landscape scale. We hypothesise that a fine-grained mosaic of patches of vegetation representing a range of biologically-derived fire frequencies, seasons and intensities will provide diverse habitat opportunities and contribute to reducing the occurrence of large, damaging and homogenising wildfires.</p>

                                                <p>Fire severity describes the amount of biomass removed, reduced or substantially altered (for example, charred) by either unplanned bushfire or planned burning. Severity relates to fire intensity but extends consideration beyond fire behaviour to incorporate ecological effects and structural changes. Thus, fire severity represents a valuable approach to gauge how planned burning or unplanned fire has impacted future fire hazards and the persistence of habitat for flora and fauna. A systematic tool to assess fire severity supports the objective evaluation of the outcomes of decision making, the methods used to apply planned burns, and assists in meeting statutory reporting obligations including fire management performance indicators and potential impacts on listed flora and fauna.</p>

                                                <p>The social and conservation values of remnant natural ecosystems in urban and peri-urban environments can be significant, particularly where they include threatened species and communities, such as the nationally listed 'Banksia woodlands of the Swan Coastal Plain ecological community'. Fire management of these systems is particularly complex as they are often: very close to homes, businesses and infrastructure; exposed to high ignition likelihoods; fragmented; subject to a wide range of other threats and disturbances; and susceptible to invasion or already supporting a number of pest plant and animal species. The spread of grassy weeds, in particular, can be enhanced by fire and promotes changes in fire regime. Knowledge of interactions between fire regimes and weed invasion will provide a basis for synergies in fire and weed management that may deliver beneficial outcomes. The study design and replication, and fuel, plant species and community response data, provide valuable research infrastructure that associated student projects and other studies can use (for example, soil properties and invertebrate responses).</p>

                                                <p>The Great Western Woodlands (GWW) is an internationally significant area with great biological and cultural richness. This 16 million hectare region of south-western Australia contains the world's largest and most intact area of contiguous temperate woodland. The GWW Conservation Strategy and a review conducted by a wide range of scientific experts identified inappropriate fire regimes as a threat to the woodlands and emphasised the need for a science-based fire management regime for the area. Critical gaps in the knowledge of fire ecology for GWW ecosystems are a hindrance to ecological fire management in the region. The GWW supports eucalypt woodlands at very low mean annual rainfall (250-350 mm). Many of the woodland eucalypt species are killed by fire (obligate-seeders), and eucalypt recruitment is stimulated by fire but individuals are slow growing. In recent decades a large part of the GWW has been burnt and concern has been expressed over the ecological impacts of this. Fire ecology research already undertaken in eastern Wheatbelt nature reserves will help resolve ecological fire management issues for mallee and mallee-heath communities in the GWW but similar information for the dominant eucalypt woodlands is needed.</p>

<li>Analysed combined on-ground vegetation structure measurements of tree allometry with high-resolution remotely piloted aircraft and medium-resolution airborne LiDAR and coarse-resolution GEDI satellite LiDAR covering the whole region. This analysis demonstrated that woodland age classes can be reliably distinguished based on their 3D canopy structure and supported identification of vegetation structural features that scale robustly across platforms for development of a spatial model of woodland age class across the whole GWW. A paper on this work has been submitted for publication.</li>
<li>Vegetation structure and biomass data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence was used to calculate changes in woodland carbon stocks with time since fire, in collaboration with CSIRO Environment and supported by Woodside Energy.</li>
<li>Juvenile period data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence formed part of a south-western Australia-wide analysis showing that juvenile period in slow-maturing serotinous obligate seeders can be predicted from climate and site productivity, allowing the development of models of juvenile period over space and time under both recent environmental conditions and those projected to occur in the future. The spatial data from this work have been made available through the Corporate Data Delivery Program and DataWA, and a BCS Information Sheet was produced to inform on-ground fire management.</li>
<li>Plant trait data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence underpinned staff involvement in national seed and dispersal trait and fire response and regeneration trait workshops hosted by the AusTraits collaboration. This work has led to the compilation of the AusTraits Plant Dictionary, which provides a clear scope and description of over 500 plant traits, with this resource available online and submitted for publication.</li>

<li>National-scale syntheses of temperate eucalypt woodland responses to disturbance revealed that many Western Australian woodlands are uniquely dominated by taxa that are obligate seeding, and have vegetation dynamics driven by rare, stand-replacing disturbances. These characteristics illustrate a putative vulnerability to decreases in intervals between fires, and large changes in vegetation composition, structure and carbon stocks with time since fire and with variation in prior fire interval. This information contributes to understanding ecological and functional responses to fire. </li>
<li>Post-fire succession in vegetation composition and structure, which in turn determines successional patterns in animals, occurs over multi-century timescales, demonstrating the value of avoiding fire in mature woodlands to maximise future fire management options.</li>
<li>Development of spatial and temporal models of juvenile period in slow-maturing serotinous obligate seeders across south-western Australia allows identification of where: (i) historic fire intervals may have led to immaturity risk impacts, assisting in delineation of areas and taxa for which targeted conservation interventions may be most valuable; and (ii) the risks of climate change-driven decreases in fire intervals are greatest and where fire management to support persistence of fire refugia is most important.</li>
<li>A spatial map of multi-century GWW woodland age classes provides the basis for departmental, Department of Fire and Emergency Services and Ngadju Conservation Aboriginal Corporation fire managers to plan fire mitigation and suppression activities to minimise loss of mature woodlands in bushfires.</li>

                                                <p>This project is a biodiversity monitoring and evaluation program to inform adaptive management of fire and cattle in the north Kimberley. The adaptive management program that forms the Landscape Conservation Initiative (LCI) of the <em>Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy</em> commenced in 2011 in response to perceived threats by cattle and fire to biodiversity conservation in the North Kimberley. This initiative is based on the hypothesis that large numbers of introduced herbivores and the impacts of current fire regimes are associated with declines of critical weight range mammals, contraction and degradation of rainforest patches, and degradation of vegetation structure and habitat condition in savannas. This monitoring and evaluation program will provide a report card on performance of landscape management initiatives in the north Kimberley, particularly prescribed burning and cattle culling, in maintaining and improving biodiversity status.</p>

<li>Trapping at Mt Hart, Wunaamin Miliwundi National Park, Mt Trafalgar and Prince Regent National Park, shows that northern quolls persist following cane toad invasion. Individuals were captured in both locations following years where none were captured.</li>
<li>Increasing the areas of longer unburnt vegetation using patch mosaic burning has contributed to re-establishment of <em>Rattus tunneyi</em> populations in the Mt Trafalgar area. This species disappeared after extensive fires in 2016, but was re-trapped in 2023 monitoring. This result vindicates ongoing evidence-based development of the Kimberley fire management program.</li>
<li>Monitoring continues to inform on threatened mammal fire responses, showing that some species, including golden-backed tree-rats and other rodents, may have peak abundance at 4-6 years post fire, followed by population decline.</li>
<li>Analysis of vegetation change under a decade of fire management indicates savanna structural stability under adaptive management and climate change.</li>
<li>An experiment assessing the potential synergies among fire and weed management for invasive annual grader grass (<em>Themeda quadrivalvis</em>) was established in Wunaamin Conservation Reserve with prefire plant community composition and cover assessed both prior to and after treatment. Treatments involved combinations of fire and either no herbicide or one of two herbicide treatments. Sites were assessed in collaboration with East Kimberley District officers and Bunuba Rangers.</li>

<li>Analysis of the monitoring data shows that increasing patchy early dry season prescribed burning benefits most threatened species.</li>
<li>The fire mosaic attribute most closely aligned with high diversity and abundance of threatened mammals is percentage of long unburnt vegetation. This indicates that long unburnt patches are an important target for prescribed burning in the region.</li>
<li>There is now strong evidence that cattle have a negative influence on threatened mammals such as the brush-tailed rabbit rat. This supports continuation of the department's feral cattle culling program for the benefit of threatened mammals and the other groups threatened by cattle.</li>
<li>Feral cats are strongly negatively associated with threatened mammal abundance and richness. In this context, it is important to maintain vegetation cover through fire and cattle management to reduce cat hunting effectiveness.</li>

                                                <p>Western Australia is an orchid biodiversity hotspot of worldwide significance, with 413 named species of orchid, of which 95% are endemic. There are currently 44 Western Australia orchid taxa listed as threatened, with the key threatening processes being habitat loss due to land clearance and fragmentation, loss of pollinators, weed invasion, illegal collection and habitat degradation. Orchids represent a conservation challenge as they have complex and sometimes highly specific ecological interactions with pollinators above ground and their mycorrhizal partners below ground. Overlaying the immediate needs of the orchid are the independent requirements of the pollinator (nectar sources, brood sites) and the mycorrhizal partner (carbon sources, soil attributes). <em>Ex situ</em> conservation of Western Australia&rsquo;s orchids is undertaken through maintaining a large living collection of orchids, seed banking and maintaining an orchid mycorrhizal library. Scientific research into pollination, orchid ecology, translocation, propagation and mycorrhizal function underpins successful species recovery in the Orchidaceae.</p>

<li>Development of germination protocols for threatened orchid species provides conservation support in the form of <em>ex situ</em> living collections, advances the possibility of translocations as a conservation tool and informs <em>ex situ</em> collection practices for functionally similar species.</li>
<li>Growing <em>ex situ</em> collections of threatened orchids provides essential conservation support for species with critically low wild plant numbers or single populations. The provision of plant material to undertake pollinator research and site selection for translocations is critical to species recovery efforts.</li>
<li>Pollinator identification, pollination syndrome, abundance of pollinators and distribution across habitat types inform regional conservation management of habitat remnants, selection of potential translocation sites and whether reproductive management of the orchid species may be necessary. </li>
<li>Updated population numbers, the discovery of new plants and populations of threatened orchid species provides vital data to regional managers to better manage populations of these threatened orchids.</li>
<li>Long term demographic monitoring data for orchids is rare but vital to perform population viability analysis and provide an understanding of orchid life stages, recruitment, reproduction and life span to inform species management and recovery.  </li>

                                    The broad goal of the Marine Science Program is to ensure the department's marine biodiversity conservation and management programs are based on best practice science. Specifically, the program promotes and undertakes marine research and monitoring to improve the scientific basis for the conservation and management of Western Australia's State-wide system of marine protected areas, threatened marine fauna and marine biodiversity generally. The program also coordinates and manages external marine research programs, such as the current investigation into the bio-physical, social and cultural values of the Kimberley that is undertaken as part of the Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI). The research and monitoring programs undertaken by the Marine Science Program are based around the research and monitoring strategies identified in protected area management plans and threatened species recovery and management plans, ensuring that all activities are linked to departmental priorities and programs.

                                                <p>To conserve WA's marine biodiversity, a network of marine parks has been established under the principles of being comprehensive, adequate and representative. These principles require knowledge of ecological assets over a statewide scale and are complicated by a changing environment. Finfish have been identified as a key ecological asset due to their high ecological and social values. Anthropogenic pressures are leading to shifts in the composition of fish assemblages, and it is unclear how well the current network of marine parks represents fish diversity. This project will combine DBCA finfish monitoring data with information collected by external collaborators to assess fish biodiversity inside and outside of WA marine parks over the last decade. This dataset will be used to describe statewide spatial and temporal patterns of finfish composition and distribution in relation to key pressures, to enable adaptive management and guide marine park planning.</p>

<li>Remotely operated video data for assessing finish has been collected in the North Kimberley and Lalang-garram marine parks, key data gap locations.</li>
<li>Data is being uploaded to GlobalArchive (https://globalarchive.org), a centralised platform that allows users to store data in a standardised and secure manner, makes meta-data discoverable, and encourages collaboration and synthesis of datasets within the community of practice.</li>
<li>A manuscript comparing fish data collected by diver operated video and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was published in <em>Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. </em>Both methods sample fish assemblages in a broadly comparable way, although fish are less wary of ROVs, indicating less behavioural biases when compared to divers. </li>
<li>A manuscript comparing fish data collected by underwater visual census, diver operated video, remotely operated vehicle and baited remote underwater video (BRUV) was published in <em>Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. </em>We found that a combination of BRUVs, which sample a unique assemblage when compared to transect based methods and ROV will provide a comprehensive assessment of fish assemblages with improved operator health and safety and field efficiency.</li>

                                                <p>The lack of knowledge of the Australian snubfin dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) meant that its conservation status could not be adequately assessed in 2011 due to insufficient information on population dynamics and distribution. This species is known from tropical coastal waters of Australia and New Guinea, but individuals tend to be evasive and difficult to study. Although they range southwards to the Pilbara region of Western Australia, there has been little locally based research on this species and the limited data collected remains unpublished. This project will compile existing data on snubfin dolphins across the Kimberley to better understand their habitat use and distribution. The collation of data into a single database will also facilitate the study of population structure and demographics based on recognised individual animals.</p>

                                                <p>Small-bodied fish (&lt;5cm) typically account for ~40% of all described fish species on coral reefs and therefore are expected to represent a substantial proportion of fish diversity in the State marine reserves. Short life spans of these small fish also suggest they are important conduits of energy transfer in marine food webs and will respond more rapidly to environmental change and stressors than larger-bodied counterparts. This is especially pertinent along the WA coastline, where marine heatwaves have dramatically impacted habitat, and fishing may have reduced the abundance of small fish predators. Standard visual methods of surveying fish are not suitable for monitoring these small cryptobenthic fish (CRF). This project will investigate whether environmental DNA (eDNA) from water and sediment samples is a viable alternative to collecting with poison (clove oil) and visual approaches for assessing CRF assemblages. By collecting data from different habitats and management zones within marine parks, the project will also assess how effectively different techniques detect a change in CRF due to spatial variation in environment or management.</p>

                                                <p>Australian snubfin (<em>Orcaella</em> <em>heinsohni</em>), Australian humpback (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose (<em>Tursiops aduncus</em>) dolphins inhabit Australia&rsquo;s north-western coastal waters, but little is known about the population sizes, distribution and residency patterns of these species. Current knowledge of these dolphin species in the Pilbara is poor and is limited to a dedicated study of humpback dolphins in Ningaloo Marine Park and Exmouth Gulf, opportunistic surveys and anecdotal sightings throughout the region. Although the presence of several coastal dolphin species is expected in nearshore Pilbara waters (including humpback, snubfin and bottlenose dolphins), very little is currently known of their residency and habitat use patterns.</p>
<p>Human pressures on these species are increasing in the Pilbara through activities associated with expansion of the resources sector, including oil and gas exploration and production, coastal infrastructure development and shipping. While these are key factors that proponents are required to address to secure State and Commonwealth environmental approvals, impact assessments for these species are complicated by the lack of best practice protocols and standards for survey design and data collection, which limits the comparison of different studies and study sites. This project will provide a better understanding of these species and their spatial and temporal use of Pilbara coastal waters, leading to greater certainty in assessing and managing impacts related to industrial developments. This project was designed to meet this priority need under the Wheatstone Offset C program.</p>

<li>Updated monitoring data was collected by DBCA or collated from collaborators for fish, coral, seagrass, macroalgae, subtidal invertebrates, little penguins, shorebirds, intertidal invertebrates, sea lions, dolphins and water quality during field work conducted across 15 marine reserves from Walpole and Nornalup Inlets Marine Park in the south to North Kimberley Marine Park in the north.</li>
<li>Updated results and findings from the monitoring program were communicated to Marine Park Coordinators and Regional Managers via the annual Marine Park Performance Assessment process, written advice, and opportunistic presentations. This information included more detailed management advice and data interpretation for the Yawuru Nagulagun/Roebuck Bay, Eighty Mile Beach and North Kimberley marine parks.</li>
<li>Seven scientific papers incorporating departmental monitoring data or examining developments in monitoring methodologies and indicators were published in <em>Global Change Biology, Marine Biology, Scientific Reports, Earth System Science Data, Communications Earth &amp; Environment, Estuarine Coastal &amp; Shelf Science</em> (2 papers), </li>
<li>Significant progress was made with the development of an online monitoring dashboard application that will eventually replace hard copy reports for individual marine parks. Funding was initially invested into the development of the background workflow, user interface and figure displays for the fish monitoring program across all marine reserves, which is now functional. Additional effort was invested into the development of coral monitoring. The first versions of this were tested with marine park coordinators and used for annual marine park reporting purposes for the first time in June this year.</li>
<li>Significant scientific advice was provided as a part of the ongoing planning process for Marmion, South Coast and Exmouth Gulf marine parks, through internal planning discussions, risk assessments and  management plan revisions, as well as community engagement forums associated with the Marmion and South Coast planning processes.</li>
<li>Monitoring programs with joint management partners in the Yawuru Nagulagun Roebuck Bay, Bardi Jawi Gaarra and Mayala marine parks were prioritised.</li>

                                                <p>Primary productivity provides energy that fuels food webs and is recognised as an important driver of local diversity and secondary production. Hence conservation planning often aims to identify where primary production is high; what systems, including their spatial arrangement, are most productive and how efficiently productivity from these producers is transferred to other systems or consumers. While marine productivity is largely attributable to oceanic phytoplankton, productivity from benthic macrophytes becomes increasingly important in coastal food webs. However, the link between benthic productivity by vascular plants and algae and secondary production remains equivocal. Moreover, local variations in hydrology are likely to influence the supply of nutrients, temperature and light (caused by turbidity), all of which are fundamental determinants of primary productivity. This project will investigate rates of primary productivity and energy transfer in the shallow, turbid waters of the Dampier Archipelago. </p>

<li>Identification of locations of high productivity may be used in spatial planning within the Dampier Archipelago and improve scientific advice relating to development projects in the area. Results will be transferable to planning in other locations with similar environmental conditions, by assessing which environmental factors correlate with high productivity.</li>
<li>The lower turf algal productivity in Dampier Archipelago compared to other tropical coral reefs indicates lower herbivorous fish productivity. This is likely driven by turbidity, which may be natural or due to local coastal development in the Dampier Archipelago. Management should consider the impacts of future coastal development that may increase turbidity beyond natural variation along WA coastlines.</li>
<li>As nearshore coral reefs experience greater turbidity with intensifying climate change and anthropogenic development, the knowledge that some scleractinian corals can alter their feeding strategies in response to turbidity levels, will allow for improved environmental impact assessment and predictive modelling for future coral reef conservation.</li>
<li>Local habitat complexity was the strongest predictor of fish abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition in both coral and macroalgal habitats and this supports management approaches that prioritise the preservation of habitat complexity and incorporate the full range of habitats present in tropical seascapes.</li>

                                                <p>Walpole and Nornalup Inlets Marine Park (WNIMP) was created in 2009 to include the entrance channel, Walpole and Nornalup inlet basins and the tidal extent of the Frankland, Deep and Walpole rivers. Invertebrates are recognised as a significant ecological value of the marine park and a key performance indicator (KPI) of management effectiveness. Additionally, benthic invertebrates are a key food source for a range of fish species in WNIMP. The benthic invertebrate community of the inlets was initially described from surveys conducted in 1984 and 1987. The fauna was relatively diverse compared with most estuaries in the south-west of Western Australia because of the predominantly marine conditions that are sustained in the inlets. Few subsequent studies have examined this fauna, and the current knowledge of benthic invertebrates in the system is considered to be inadequate for marine reserve management. Furthermore, as there are strong recreational fishing values associated with the region, understanding trophic links between benthic invertebrates and fish in the estuary is important for management of the marine park.</p>

                                                <p>Macroalgae are a prominent component of tropical benthic communities along the north-west coast of Australia. Within Ningaloo Marine Park, large fields of macroalgae are a distinct feature of the lagoon, covering approximately 2000 hectares. These macroalgal fields are important habitats for fish targeted by recreational fishers and are a focal area for boating activity within the park. Moreover, large seasonal shifts in algal biomass on these and other tropical reefs suggest macroalgae play an important role in nutrient fluxes in Ningaloo and similar systems. Recent work at Ningaloo has quantitatively assessed seasonal variation in biomass and diversity of macroalgal communities. This project will build on the information gained from these initial studies to improve understanding of how macroalgae are distributed across the Ningaloo lagoon and better define the role of macroalgal fields as habitat for fish recruits and adults.</p>

<li>Macroalgal data collected contributed to an Indo-Pacific examination of the broadscale effects of human disturbance on macroalgal cover on coral reefs. The study found that generalisations about total algal cover are ineffective and that finer scale genus level data is required to fully understand ecosystem impacts. A paper was published in <em>Global Change Biology.</em></li>
<li>Data from fish surveys over the past 11 years were used to examine if abundance of recruit and juvenile fish can predict abundance of adult spangled and yellow tail emperor. Modelling indicates that juveniles reliably forecast abundance of fish 1-2 years of age, but not older fish. A full draft of the paper has now progressed for submission.</li>

<li>Identifying locations and environmental conditions that consistently have high abundance and diversity of juvenile fish will help to pinpoint essential nurseries for fish, which as adults play key ecological roles, maintain biodiversity of fish assemblages and/or contribute to local fisheries.</li>
<li>Understanding how climatic processes affect both the supply of juveniles and quality of nursery habitat improves our understanding of temporal fluctuations in fish abundance and ability to predict future populations.</li>
<li>Improving the capacity to predict future abundances of adult fishes, particularly those threatened by changes to habitat, climate and fishing pressure, will help to maintain important social values like recreational fishing.</li>
<li>Understanding the carbon capture potential of benthic communities in marine reserves will better inform future policy and increase our understanding of the broader economic and social value of conserving habitats through marine management practicies.</li>

                                                <p>This project uses satellite telemetry to track turtles that are released to the wild with minimal and extensive rehabilitation. In addition, turtles are tracked to identify connectivity between different habitats in their life stages. Commonly, turtles are tracked from nesting beaches to identify habitat, migration routes and resident foraging grounds. The tracking results identify the geographic range and preferred habitats and provide insight into the viability and survivorship of healthy and rehabilitated turtles in the wild. The identification of preferred habitat allows pressures to be identified and prioritised for different size classes. As tracking results will be broadcast live on the internet (updated daily via <a href="http://www.seaturtle.org">www.seaturtle.org</a>) there is a direct link between the department's science activities and the community. The genetic information (derived from samples collected routinely across a range of projects) will provide another layer of information that helps to describe the spatial range of sea turtles in Western Australia.</p>

                                                <p>Seagrasses are foundation species that support important ecosystem services and processes worldwide. Seagrass meadows are declining globally and anthropogenic pressures such as terrestrial run-off, anchor damage and dredging threaten the ecological, economic and social services that seagrass meadows provide. Some of the world's largest and most diverse seagrass meadows occur in Western Australia and support many commercially, recreationally and culturally important fauna. As the condition of seagrass meadows respond readily to pressures, they are used as indicators for the overall effectiveness of management across marine reserves managed by the department. Across-region comparisons and thorough temporal assessments of seagrass condition will provide a broader appreciation of seagrass health among the State&rsquo;s network of marine reserves. Furthermore, a greater understanding of how the climate change related pressures of increased seawater temperature and extreme events impact seagrass meadows and the ecosystem services they provide, is needed. This is particularly the case in vulnerable regions like Shark Bay, where the full extent of seagrass loss since the 2010-11 marine heatwave in Western Australia&rsquo;s largest World Heritage Area was, until recently, not well understood. </p>

<li>The global database on seagrass structure, biomass and production was finalised and published in <em>Pangaea</em>, as well as the corresponding manuscript in <em>Earth System Science Data</em> .</li>
<li>Indicators of seagrass condition collated across 60 sites in six WA marine reserves were analysed using a hierarchical Generalised Additive Model approach to assess the influence of environmental factors on trends in seagrass condition. Additionally, these data were used to inform four experiments investigating pressure-response thresholds for the impacts of dredging and ocean warming on seagrasses through the WAMSI-Westport project and ECU collaborations.</li>

                                    Perth Zoo Science Program undertakes targeted research to support the breed-for-release of seven threatened species. It also addresses knowledge gaps in our understanding of behaviour, reproductive biology and conservation medicine for the species in the Zoo’s collection and smaller number of species in the wild. The research program involves projects dealing with environmental communication and socio-ecology.

                                                <p>There are two species of <em>Anstisia</em> (formerly <em>Geocrinia</em>) frogs, white-bellied frogs (<em>Anstisia alba) </em>and orange-bellied frogs (<em>A. vitellina)</em>, that have a restricted distribution in south-west Western Australia and are listed as critically endangered and vulnerable, respectively. Whilst these frogs lay large clutches of eggs, the survival rate to adult frogs is low. Captive rearing of eggs to metamorphs is an effective means of overcoming this constraint and providing supplementation of animals into the populations. Egg clutches of both species are collected from the wild and metamorphs are raised and subsequently released to the wild. Additionally, there is ongoing research and husbandry management to achieve regular and reliable captive breeding in both species.</p>

Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught dibblers is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Dibblers are one of the species identified for reintroduction to Dirk Hartog Island following cat and goat eradication, and this is being achieved through captive breeding of animals sourced from the midwest islands.</p>

                                                <p>Animals' survival depends on good and timely solutions to the problems being experienced. Sometimes problems are widely spaced in time so a problem solving strategy that is not retained in their memory does not provide a substantial cognitive economy to the individual. Among terrestrial mammals, elephants, along with humans and great apes, have large brains, are long-lived and have offspring that require long periods of dependency. Studying the memory of an Asian elephant may allow greater insights into the evolution of cognitive abilities in large brained animals.</p>

                                                <p>Numbats (<em>Myrmecobius fasciatus</em>) are listed as endangered, and occur in only two natural populations at very low densities. Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught numbats is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. A captive breeding program for numbats at Perth Zoo has been in place since 1992. Captive bred numbats have enabled new populations to be established at Boyagin Nature Reserve, Battaling Forest and fenced reserves at Dryandra National Park, Mount Gibson Sanctuary in Western Australia, Yookamurra Sanctuary and Secret Rocks Mallee Refuge (South Australia), and Scotia Sanctuary and Mallee Cliffs National Park (New South Wales).</p>

                                                <p>Keeping charismatic megafauna such as Asian elephants is challenging. Elephants are intelligent, social and long-lived. Managing their welfare and ensuring that they are provided with the best standard of care requires a detailed knowledge of their behaviour. Despite a long history of domestication and keeping in captivity, little research has been conducted into sensory and cognitive functions in elephants. Examining the various components of their behaviour with carefully designed research programs allows us to understand the limits of their intelligence and to be able to modify husbandry and behavioural enrichment programs in order to provide optimal welfare conditions for the elephants.</p>

<li>Banding was undertaken for 131 (103 as pullus, 4 as adults and 24 rehabilitated) Carnaby&rsquo;s cockatoos, along with 8 Baudin's cockatoos (all rehabilitated) and 21 forest red-tailed black cockatoos (all rehabilitated). </li>
<li>36 recovery records and re-sightings (photo identification or scanning of microchips) were made of Carnaby&rsquo;s cockatoos and two Forest red-tailed black cockatoos.  Only five of those records involved birds that had died &ndash; one that died in the nest hollow as a pullus and three that died due to misadventure, major traumatic events or of unknown cause(s).</li>
<li>Three research papers have been submitted for review or have been revised and re-submitted. One paper focuses on whether conservation management of Carnaby&rsquo;s cockatoo should be considered at a regional level; one focuses on the use of accelerometry to reveal foraging on a novel food source to reduce energetic costs of nestling provisioning in Carnaby&rsquo;s cockatoo; and, one reports on the health parameters of wild Carnaby&rsquo;s cockatoo nestlings.</li>
<li>Analyses of banding data for Carnaby&rsquo;s cockatoo to determine a more accurate annual survival estimate continued, along with annual survival estimates for rehabilitated Carnaby&rsquo;s and forest red-tailed black cockatoos.</li>
<li>Work continued on a manuscript describing the costs of rehabilitating black cockatoos, relative to other types of conservation action.</li>

<li>This project has seen the successful release of 757 leg-banded rehabilitated cockatoos (418 Carnaby&rsquo;s, 53 Baudin&rsquo;s and 286 forest red-tailed black cockatoos).  The total number of cockatoos banded  (all species and all ages) is now 2087 providing data for understanding breeding dynamics of the population.  The rehabilitation techniques and release protocols currently in use provide very high survival rates, as supported by the high number of cockatoos which contributes to the conservation of these three species.</li>

Less than 150 birds remain in the wild, and these are threatened by foxes and feral cats. Habitat critical to the species' survival has been threatened by extensive wildfires in recent years. In July 2014, seven western ground parrots were transferred from departmental aviary facilities near Albany to Perth Zoo in a successful attempt to establish a captive insurance population and to investigate the potential for future breeding for release.</p>

Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught tortoises is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Captive bred tortoises have enabled new populations to be established at Moore River Nature Reserve and Mogumber Nature Reserve, with trial assisted colonisation sites on the south coast of Western Australia. Two additional captive insurance populations have been established at Adelaide Zoo and Monarto Zoo (South Australia) to reduce the risks associated with keeping half the global population of western swamp tortoises in a single facility.</p>

                                    Applied flora conservation research seeks to understand the factors and processes that are critical for the conservation of Western Australia's native plant diversity. Major objectives include ensuring the persistence of rare and threatened species, understanding key threats such as Phytophthora dieback and weeds, and improving the understanding of genetic and ecological factors that are vital for the long-term viability of plant species. Strong collaborative linkages exist with universities, cooperative research centres, CSIRO, other research providers such as the National Environmental Science Program and the corporate sector.The program includes the Western Australian Herbarium that houses the State collection of scientific specimens of plants, algae and fungi. Information in the collection underpins the conservation of Western Australian flora. The Herbarium is responsible for: documenting and understanding the diversity of Western Australia's plants, algae and fungi; maintaining a research and archive collection of specimens of all species in these groups from throughout their range in Western Australia; helping the community, industry and researchers understand and identify plants, algae and fungi; contributing to, supporting and servicing the research, conservation and decision-making activities of  government; contributing to taxonomic research by the Australian and the international scientific community; providing authoritative information to government, industry and the community via the FloraBase website and the Herbarium's information management systems.

<div>Florabase, the web information system for the Western Australian flora, is the State's central warehouse for botanical taxonomic information. Florabase draws from three core databases for names (WACensus), specimens (WAHerb) and images (Imagebank). Actively managing the currency, authority, data quality, and linkages between these datasets is an important task, both for maintaining Florabase and contributing to State, national and global plant information resources such as Dandjoo, the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). WAHerb is the Herbarium's specimen database and is the sole source of specimen data used by Florabase. Imagebank is the Herbarium's image collection.</div>

<li>The Western Australia Herbarium shared specimens with nine national and seven international institutions, and shipped 260 specimens in six loans for scientific research. A total of 3710 exchange specimens were sent to collaborating institutions, and 16 requests for 270 tissue samples from herbarium specimens were processed for molecular and other scientific analyses.</li>
<li>Major activities within the collections included substantial and targeted reduction in unprocessed specimens (all collections pre-2014 now processed), incorporation of specimens returned to the Western Australian Herbarium from Manjimup (390 specimens), processing and incorporation of Herbarium Lowerianum (700 specimens), Robert Brown Iter Australiense historical specimens (165), Bush Blitz specimens (460 specimens), and completion of the incorporation of specimens received from the South West Regional Herbarium (1920 specimens).</li>
<li>Specimens and data were cited in more than 130 publications; the collection and associated data have been cited 3025 times since the early 1900s.</li>
<li>A collection of Type specimen photographs continues to be developed (currently &gt;1375 items), increasing the space within the Types Vault and improving care of the physical (true) Type specimens.</li>
<li>With the assistance of volunteers, 9400 specimens were mounted.</li>
<li>Volunteer participation continues to be a significant and invaluable resource, totaling 3725 hours - equivalent to approximately 2.4 full time employees. The Herbarium was assisted by 30 regular volunteers and 14 Research Associates.</li>
<li>The Reference Herbarium was accessed 2450 times by visitors, volunteers and industry consultants for plant identifications and other scientific purposes.</li>
<li>The Research Collection was accessed 1600 times by visitors for the study and identification of taxa.</li>
<li>The Herbarium Identification Program provided identifications to a range of clients, including departmental staff, other government agencies, environmental consultancies, regional herbaria and the public. More than 2309 specimen identifications in 48 transactions, along with more than 50 image-based identifications, were undertaken for external clients.</li>
<li>Educational programs consisted of 12 herbarium tours and monthly induction sessions for departmental staff, tertiary institutions, environmental consultancies, community groups and the media (approximately 300 participants). A display in the Atrium is regularly updated to highlight the work of the Western Australian Herbarium. The Herbarium also trained two UWA Work Integrated Learning interns, one UWA McCusker intern, and one Notre Dame intern.</li>
<li>The Western Australian Herbarium facebook page, with more than 7300 followers, shares a monthly 'Plant of the Month' and other interesting botanical announcements.</li>

<li>A study to assess mating system variation and genetic diversity for two translocated <em>Banksia brownii</em> populations and benchmark these measures against seven natural populations has been completed. In addition, a pollination study on a subset of four of the natural and one of the translocated populations of <em>Banksia brownii</em> to assess the adequacy of pollination in the translocated population, has also been completed. Key findings were the use of multiple source populations for translocation resulted in higher reproductive output and equivalent levels of genetic diversity compared to reference wild populations. However, the translocated population had the highest rates of selfing, which could potentially lead to the long-term erosion of genetic diversity through unfavourable patterns of mating. The results of these studies have been published in the <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>.</li>
<li>Assessment of fitness traits is ongoing in a common garden experiment involving 1100 seedlings of <em>Banksia brownii</em> from montane and lowland natural populations and a translocated population, to examine trait differences between montane and lowland populations, and implications for population mixing, and to benchmark the performance of the translocated population. Initial findings have shown that outcrossed seedlings have higher fitness than self-pollinated seedlings and management of the translocated populations should focus on ways to improve pollinator services to improve long-term translocation success. Two manuscripts have been prepared from this work. One is in draft and the second is in review for publication in <em>Restoration Ecology</em>.</li>
<li>Data analysis has been completed on genetic diversity data for natural and translocated populations of <em>Acacia cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em> and <em>A. cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>velutinosa</em>. This study will benchmark genetic diversity in translocated and natural populations of <em>A. cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em> and assess genetic structure across the range of both subspecies. Key results include levels of genetic diversity in two translocated populations are equivalent to the single wild source population and two other wild populations, indicating the use of the single seed source for the translocation was appropriate. Patterns of genetic structure across the two subspecies generally indicate significant differentiation between them. An exception was a population of <em>A. cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em> near Dowerin that showed less differentiation from the subsp. <em>velutinosa</em> whilst fitting the morphological description of subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em>. A manuscript describing this study is in preparation.</li>
<li>Analysis of genotyping and mating system data has been completed for <em>Banksia anatona,</em> to assess mating system performance and genetic diversity in a translocated population compared to natural populations. Results showed genetic diversity of two translocated populations were equivalent to three wild source populations and the mating system estimates for one translocated population (second translocation not assessed) largely reflected those of wild populations. The species showed a predominantly outcrossing mating system. A manuscript describing this study is near completion.</li>
<li>Genetic and taxonomic revision of subspecies within <em>Lambertia orbifolia</em> has been completed. This work used earlier genetic analysis of <em>Lambertia orbifolia</em> and combined this with a genetic study of a recently discovered population and measures of herbarium specimens to formally describe three subspecies. This taxonomic revision was published in <em>Nuytsia</em>. </li>
<li>Genomic analysis of two species, <em>Banksia cuneata</em> and <em>Chorizema humile</em>, is currently underway to assess genetic diversity and population differentiation across extant populations, both natural and translocated, as well as to assess the genetic diversity of seed collections currently stored in the Western Australian Seed Centre. </li>
<li>Genomic analysis of <em>Tetratheca butcheriana</em> is currently underway to assess fine scale patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation across its very narrow range in the Pilbara. </li>

<li>Assessment of genetic variation and mating system parameters will inform prescriptions for the prevention of inbreeding and maintenance of genetic variation in small fragmented populations of rare and threatened plants, and will facilitate strategies for managing inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity during translocation programs involving species such as <em>B. brownii,</em> <em>L. orbifolia, A. cochlocarpa </em>and <em>Schoenia filifolia. </em>For species in resource-rich areas, such as <em>T. butcheriana</em> in the Pilbara, information on genetic diversity and gene flow patterns will also inform impact assessments for future mining activities. </li>

                                                <p>Stinking passionflower (<em>Passiflora foetida</em>), a perennial vine native to South and Central America, is a highly invasive weed in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia and other parts of the world. In the Pilbara, the weed is rapidly expanding its abundance in areas with slightly higher moisture availability than the surrounding landscape, including coastal reserves and riparian habitats. Options for effective management of the weed in these areas are limited and biological control is being investigated as a potential management strategy in collaboration with CSIRO. Limited knowledge of the biology and life history of stinking passionflower is a significant impediment to implementing effective weed management strategies, including biological control. Ecological and genetic characterisation is required to understand the invasion ecology of the species and to guide the search for suitable biological control agents from the native range. </p>

<li>A total of 72 seed collections (32 species) were banked at the Western Australia Seed Centre, Kensington; 70 of these collections (30 species) were listed as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable (threatened flora), two of these collections (two species) were priority flora.</li>
<li>27 seed collections from 10 threatened species and two priority species were collected for the Rare Bloom Project&trade;.</li>
<li>Six seed collections from four threatened species were collected for the Conservation of Critically Endangered Species (Australia) project, a collaboration between DBCA, The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (UK) and the Australian Seed Bank Partnership.</li>
<li>Three seed collections from three species were collected for the Safeguarding Midwest Flora project, a collaboration between DBCA and Northern Agricultural Catchment Council as part of the Threatened Species Strategy Action Plan funded by the Australian Government.</li>
<li>The seed bank now contains 6232 collections (1927 taxa) representing 349 threatened flora, 749 Priority flora and 829 flora for ecological restoration.</li>
<li>235 germination tests were conducted.</li>
<li>26 accessions were used to produce seedlings of nine threatened species for use in translocation.</li>
<li>Seedlings of one species, <em>Schoenia filifolia </em>subsp.<em> subulifolia</em>, were planted into a seed production area (SPA) at Woodlupine Primary School, whilst seed of the same species was provided to continue a SPA at the Central Regional TAFE in Geraldton. In it&rsquo;s first year the Geraldton SPA yielded over 700g of seed from the 80g used to establish the site. Some of this seed is now being used to augment a translocation of the species.</li>

<li>Seed conservation supports the survival of species in the wild by providing the genetic material for reintroduction; seed is provided for translocations of threatened flora and for departmental restoration projects.</li>
<li>Provision of seed biology and ecology data increases the success of threatened flora recovery actions, particularly through knowledge of how pre-treatments may stimulate seed germination.</li>
<li>Re-testing of old collections (&gt;10 years) is showing that the storage conditions at the Western Australian Seed Centre are maintaining the viability of most tested collections. Viability declines, whilst uncommon, have occurred, highlighting the importance of ongoing monitoring at regular intervals to the management of <em>ex situ</em> seed collections.</li>

This project undertakes basic taxonomic studies in these three genera, including the description of new species and taxonomic assessments of existing taxa, and preparation of a <em>Flora of Australia</em> treatment for the family Amaranthaceae. Development of interactive keys to all Western Australian species in the three genera are being undertaken, as these keys will allow easier and more accurate identifications of all species.</p>

<p>Clarifying the taxonomy and identification of <em>Ptilotus</em>, <em>Gomphrena, Eremophila</em> and <em>Swainsona</em> is important as these genera include indicator species and are significant for rangeland and arid land management and assessment. Many species are annuals and <em>Swainsona</em> is a nitrogen-fixing legume. Some species of <em>Ptilotus</em> have been shown to have high phosphate uptake capabilities and are potentially useful in land restoration and rehabilitation programs. Several species within each genus are listed as threatened flora or are on the priority flora list. Having a sound taxonomic understanding of the species within these genera will enable the department to provide informed advice on the conservation status of the species and the communities they inhabit and how best they can be managed.</p>

                                                <p>With more than 300 known taxa, the triggerplant genus <em>Stylidium</em> is one of Australia's most abundant and diversified genera. While substantial progress has been made over the past 20 years in documenting Australia&rsquo;s <em>Stylidium</em> diversity, our knowledge of the genus remains insufficient for scientific and conservation needs. There are new taxa awaiting formal description, species complexes that remain poorly understood and a number of nomenclature and typification issues that require resolution. The most significant issue at this point is the lack of an overarching flora treatment for the family Stylidiaceae, which hinders survey and accurate identification by conservation personnel, botanical consultants and other stakeholders.</p>

                                                <p>Western Australia has a rich flora that is far from fully known. New species continue to be discovered through the taxonomic assessment of herbarium collections, floristic surveys and the botanical assessment of mineral leases. There are more than 1062 putatively new and undescribed taxa on Western Australia&rsquo;s vascular plant census, almost half of which are poorly known, geographically restricted and/or under threat (threatened or priority flora). The lack of detailed information on these taxa makes accurate identification problematic and inevitably delays the department&rsquo;s ability to survey and accurately assess their conservation status. </p>

The circumscription of the genus <em>Styphelia </em>has now been expanded to include all taxa previously in <em>Astroloma</em>, <em>Coleanthera</em> and <em>Croninia</em>, and a large percentage of those in <em>Leucopogon. </em>A recent publication formalising these changes has opened the way to the process of describing the many phrase name taxa of <em>Styphelia </em>(in the newly expanded sense) that are currently listed under <em>Leucopogon.</em> A significant number of these are short range endemics of conservation significance. In addition, there is still much taxonomic work remaining in <em>Leucopogon </em><em>s. str. </em>and new taxa in all epacrid genera continue to come to light with some regularity. </p>

                                                <p>The Western Australian Plant Census (a component of WACensus and Nomos) is the authoritative database of the flora (vascular and non vascular plants, algae, fungi and slime moulds) found in Western Australia, including synonyms created by taxonomic research and concept changes. It is continually updated to reflect changes in our knowledge of the flora. The census constitutes the fundamental master list for many departmental processes and data sets, including the threatened and priority flora database maintained by the Species and Communities Program, the Herbarium's specimen database (WAHerb), Max (the departmental software for information based on taxonomic names), <em>Florabase</em> and <em>Dandjoo </em>(Biodiversity Information Office).</p>
<p>The Australian Plant Census (APC) is a Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria project, part of the National Species List infrastructure, designed to provide a consensus view of all Australian plant taxa. The APC delivers authoritative information on what species occur in Australia as a whole to obtain accurate national statistics and resolve differences in opinion and knowledge for taxa that cross State boundaries. In addition to working systematically through the vascular plant families, the APC process provides for updates as taxonomic changes or new findings are formally published. The consensus also extends from family and genus level to an overall classification of the plants that occur in Australia. The Western Australian Plant Census is updated to reflect the consensus view, produced annually. The APC provides the key name list for the Atlas of Living Australia and the Australasian Virtual Herbarium.</p>

<li>Studies of the effects of fire interval, <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback, browsing and threat mitigation actions on population trends for 26 threatened and Priority flora in the Stirling Range National Park provided critical information on impacts of 2018 and 2019 fires and priorities for species recovery through <em>in situ </em>threat management and translocation. </li>
<li>Demographic studies and experiments investigating the impact of disease, fire intervals and patchiness, and environmental weeds on threatened flora will provide critical information for supporting species recovery.  </li>
<li>Spatial analysis of threatened and Priority flora and threats identified ancient, infertile uplands and surface geologies of limited extent within 300-500 km of the present-day coast as hotspots for flora conservation and management. Flora on these geologies have higher frequencies of traits that elevate their susceptibility to extremes in fire interval and <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback. Differences in patterns of spatial distribution of data-deficient and threatened flora suggest that conservation activities directed at mitigating threats to natural populations of threatened flora will not be effective for the conservation management of a significant proportion of the data-deficient flora. This finding emphasises the value of threat mitigation actions in locations supporting numerous data-deficient flora.</li>

                                    The Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis Program seeks to integrate the science and application of remote sensing and spatial analysis into departmental programs. For a department that manages large tracts of terrestrial and marine conservation parks and reserves, the efficient use and analysis of spatial data is crucial for understanding natural processes and informing management actions.In recent times the availability of spatial data has increased dramatically. With this increase in data, the Program is continuing to develop sophisticated statistical analysis, interpretative and automation techniques to synthesise data into a form where they directly assist departmental staff.The program undertakes fire mapping over extensive areas of the State. Utilising time series satellite imagery and ground information,  monitoring programs have been established in the forest, wetland, marine, coastal, rangeland and tropical savanna environments. Species and habitat modelling and spatially explicit assessments, such as risk assessments, allow managers to identify areas of concern and efficiently utilise resources. Program scientists collaborate with other parts of the department, universities, CSIRO, natural resource management groups, resource companies and other research providers.

                                                <p>The department's fire management, monitoring and reporting functions require knowledge of fire events that are effectively derived through fire scar mapping. The imagery used for this analysis is predominantly satellite imagery and includes optical and thermal imagery from airborne platforms. Research areas include historical mapping that utilises the extensive archive record of satellite imagery and occasionally aerial imagery to build a fire history (or fuel age) for a location or to reconstruct the spread of major bushfires. These activities also include monthly mapping during the prescribed burn season. The project also plays a key role in fire research and development, through research into fuel growth, fire spread, fire risk and fire severity models. Internal and collaborative activities are carried out to further streamline and automate mapping techniques. General imagery support is also provided to Fire Management Services Branch and regional staff, including incident mapping and prediction and advice about imagery and systems development.</p>

                                                <p>The measurement and analysis of change across terrestrial, wetland and marine environments using remote sensing provides essential historical and current information that can be used to understand the effects of management actions and natural events. The imagery used is predominantly satellite imagery, and also includes optical imagery from handheld and airborne platforms [manned aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)] and LiDAR data. Field observations provide essential ground truth and calibration of remotely sensed data. Analysis techniques include an increasing number of sophisticated time series analysis tools and object orientated image classification. This work is underpinned by efficient and statistically rigorous analysis and batch processing techniques in the R programming environment. Remote sensing monitoring relies on repeatable and consistent source imagery and developing methods to produce reliable spatial and statistical products that the department can use for reporting on the State of the Environment, managing the conservation estate and assessing the threats to biodiversity.</p>

                                                <p>The spatial analysis and modelling project develops and utilises tools to assist in the evaluation, interpretation and prediction of conservation values, threatening processes and management actions. These tools generally integrate spatial data sets, expert knowledge and GIS modelling techniques to produce spatially explicit products that can be used to inform decision making. Projects can be focused on species occurrence (species distribution models or habitat suitability modelling), animal movement (for example, identification of home range or habitat linkages), landscape scale processes (including assessment of habitat fragmentation) or assessments such as quantifying risk (for example risk presented by feral cattle to biodiversity values). Identification of areas of high conservation value for protection is also undertaken by combining numerous conservation value data sets and using software to evaluate possible conservation scenarios. </p>

                                                <p>This core function manages spatial data sets by creating metadata, cleaning data to a corporate standard and saving or migrating data in a secure and accessible corporate data repository - the Spatial Data Library. Many of the data sets in the Spatial Data Library are identified through departmental project requirements. Large data sets include imagery and digital elevation models captured for general use across the department or for specific projects and have multiple uses such as time series analysis, spatial analysis, modelling, and decision making for management, monitoring, planning and policy. Departmental collaborations also produce key data sets that are important but may not be ready to use or need a license arrangement to be utilised by the department. Making fundamental data sets accessible to all staff through corporate GIS software is an effective way of communicating what science is being undertaken and also assists with determining management priorities and actions.</p>

                                                <p>Parts of the Swan and Canning Rivers are affected by temporally and spatially variable algal blooms. While most algal blooms are harmless, on occasion, toxic blooms occur that can be harmful to the rivers, wildlife and humans. The impact of these blooms on environmental and social values will depend on the type and severity of the bloom. Understanding the dynamics of algal blooms is important in determining their impact and approaches to their control. Regular monitoring of the Swan and Canning Rivers enables retrospective analyses of bloom events and adaptive approaches to in-river bloom management. Many approaches are promoted for managing algal blooms. Finding useful and applicable methods for managing blooms in the Swan and Canning Rivers requires a combination of desktop analyses, laboratory and field based trials. It is also important to consider the potential impact of control products on waterway values.</p>

This information is particularly important in relation to recreationally targeted fish species that have high value in the Perth community.</p>
<p>Acoustic technology can be utilised to provide valuable information on fish movements relative to water quality parameters, such as salinity and dissolved oxygen, and to major interventions within the river system, such as the Swan Canning Oxygenation Program and the Kent Street Weir fishway. Acoustic technology can also be employed to understand how fish utilise habitats of differing complexity, particularly those that are not suited to traditional sampling methods. An acoustic array in the Swan Canning was established in 2016. </p>

                                                <p>Ellen Brook is a tributary to the Swan Canning Estuary and is identified as the major contributor of nutrient loads to the system. Water quality in Ellen Brook catchment and its sub-catchments is influenced by a mixture of land uses and activities affecting both surface and groundwater inputs. Previous attempts have been made to model nutrient exports from the catchment but there remain uncertainties in the groundwater and land use type contributions to the overall nutrient export to the estuary. Refinement of nutrient modeling with inclusion of groundwater-surface water interactions is essential to reduce these uncertainties. To better inform land management policy and support decision making for nutrient interventions, a distributed, 2D, processed-based hydrological and nutrient model for Ellen Brook is being developed. The model will quantify nutrient export from specific land use types, differentiate active and legacy sources and illustrate spatial and temporal variability. Climate influence will also be considered.</p>

                                                <p>The Swan-Canning Estuary (SCE) is a microtidal system that has become subject to increasing urbanisation and development along its shorelines. As a result, river walls and rock revetments have previously been used to modify the shoreline and provide protection against erosion, often resulting in reduced natural habitats and species abundance. Eco-engineered habitats are an alternative method to aid in protecting shorelines and reducing erosion, whilst promoting biodiversity and alleviating declines in habitats. As existing modifications in the SCE reach the end of their intended lifespans and new structures are built to reduce erosion, there is potential to integrate eco-engineered technological and nature-based solutions in the SCE.</p>

                                                <p>Fish communities exhibit predictable responses to ecosystem degradation and stress, and thus may be used as sensitive indicators of the ecological condition of these systems. Biotic indices, based on fish and other biological communities, are now used worldwide to quantify the ecological health of rivers, lakes, estuaries and many other environments. This project applies a Fish Community Index (FCI) developed by Murdoch University in collaboration with government agencies (2007-12) as a measure of the condition of the Swan Canning River system. This has been part of regular monitoring and reporting on the waterway since 2012 and a report on fish communities in the Swan Canning Riverpark is released to the public annually.</p>

<li>A report documenting the 2022 fish community index (FCI) results was completed. </li>
<li>In the 2022 season, the combined scores for offshore and nearshore sites were the best recorded over the last decade of monitoring. These were attributed to strong flows in the winter of 2021, which were the best in 25 years.</li>
<li>Scores in offshore waters of the Canning Estuary were poorer in comparison to other zones and this result continues an historic trend.</li>
<li>Further investigation of this trend identified that the low FCI scores were influenced by low number of species and diversity and a high proportion of detritivores in the offshore waters of the Canning. Low dissolved oxygen did not appear to be a factor driving these results. </li>
<li>A report on the 2023 season is in preparation.</li>

                                                <p>The Swan Canning Estuary is home to diverse faunal assemblages, productive seagrass and macroalgal communities and is a focus for many water-based activities, including recreational fishing. The estuary is situated wholly in the Perth metropolitan region and drains a large agricultural catchment. It faces many anthropogenic stressors including flow reduction, excessive nutrient input, and contaminant loading associated with a range of contemporary and historical land uses. Ensuring environmental and social values are maintained requires an understanding of threats. In particular, it is vital to understand the extent, distribution and potential impact of both novel and legacy contaminants, evaluate risk to the ecosystem and human health and improve approaches to management.</p>

<li>Information on the distribution and concentration of contaminants in the estuary is used to identify the potential environmental risk to the estuary.</li>
<li>Analysis of PFAS in surface water in the estuary indicates low risk. Three surface water catchments where PFAS concentrations were elevated have been identified, and the information has informed initiation of management activities to mitigate PFAS runoff. </li>
<li>Evaluation of PFAS levels in black bream, and blue swimmer crabs, and contamination in western school prawns, provided evidence for decisions on health risk to recreational fishers from consumption of these species.</li>
<li>Sediment contamination in 2015 was largely consistent with that in 2007 and provides a useful baseline for determining contaminant change over time and in response to management action. Information on sediment contaminant levels informs development planning approvals and highlights zones where risks associated with contaminant disturbance are greatest.</li>

                                                <p>Ocean sprawl is an increasing disturbance that is occurring along the Lower Swan-Canning Estuary (LSCE), replacing complex marine habitats with simplistic artificial structures, that can result in the decline of species richness and abundance. Using remote image collection methods (ROVs, drop-cameras, and tow-cameras) in conjunction with habitat classification systems, benthic surveys can be conducted across areas of importance to assist is assessing species abundance and extent of species reduction over time. As the LSCE is an important ecosystem for a range of species and habitats, as well as recreational users, collecting data to establish distribution maps of key habitats is essential to understand the influences of this system. </p>

                                                <p>In the period spanning 2011-2016, the department and project partners at The University of Western Australia (UWA) and Department of Water and Environmental Regulation resourced the development of a spatially resolved coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, the Swan Canning Estuarine response model (SCERM). The model is a useful tool that can be used for predictive purposes as well as display. The SCERM model has the capacity to complement but not replace, regular water quality monitoring and to simulate and display information on a wider spatial scale and over finer temporal resolution than the existing weekly water quality reporting. This project explores the capacity of a predictive model framework to rationalise water quality monitoring data, display information in a near real-time format and enhance understanding of the waterway.</p>

                                                <p>Seagrasses are a highly valued component of estuary ecosystems as they improve water quality by reducing sediment resuspension, removing nutrients, providing habitat and as a food source for waterbirds. Seagrasses respond to changes in their physical and chemical environment and are recognised as being a bioindicator of ecosystem health, with loss of seagrass representing degraded conditions. Ensuring that seagrass communities remain viable and resilient is an essential component of effective estuary management. DBCA continues to monitor seagrass throughout the Swan Canning Estuary to inform management decisions on new development proposals and to track the condition of estuarine health.</p>

<li>Annual seagrass sampling was conducted within the Swan Canning Estuary. Seagrass presence was lower in 2022-23 compared to the previous season. This may be attributed to a lower global solar exposure this season, however seagrass performance was still rated as &lsquo;good&rsquo;. </li>
<li>The high seagrass presence in the 2021-22 season increased reproductive success this season, with the number of flowers/fruits/seeds all increasing compared to last season.</li>
<li>Analyses determined that the invasive snail, <em>Batillaria australis, </em>reduced considerably (&gt;60%) between 2017 and 2019, potentially due to the freshwater influx through the 2017 high rainfall event. </li>
<li>Benthic habitat mapping progressed through shoreline ground truthing and drop-cam image collection. Drop-cam images have been processed and will be used to train habitat classification algorithms applied to new WorldView-2 satellite images.</li>

Information on dissolved oxygen distribution and likelihood of benthic water experiencing hypoxia in each season are needed to ensure the plants are operating optimally under current and future climate conditions. This project will contribute to improved oxygenation approaches in the estuary by developing better understanding of variability and drivers of oxygen conditions and enabling predictive support for decisions in relation to oxygenation effectiveness.</p>

Further investigation suggested model  flow constriction from Belhus to West Swan, which could not be overcome through model function modification.

                                                <p>Western Australia is home to many different varieties of wetlands, from tidal mangroves and billabongs, to salt lakes and fresh water springs. Access to accurate geospatial and ecological information about wetlands improves the basis for informed decisions on the management and conservation of wetlands. The department coordinates mapping of Western Australia's wetlands and maintains digital datasets containing spatial data and associated attribution. The mapping identifies the presence of wetlands, delineates boundaries, classification and assigns the wetland to a management category on the basis of its values. This mapping ensures accurate information about wetlands is available to land managers and decision makers, improving the basis for informed decision making about wetland management and conservation. </p>

The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation and wise use of representative, rare and unique wetlands, wetlands important for biodiversity conservation and their resources. Being a signatory to the Ramsar Convention, Australia has undertaken to ensure our internationally important wetlands are conserved. There are 12 Ramsar wetland sites in Western Australia.</p>

                                            <p>This project aims to assess the health and disease status of sea turtles in Western Australia, with a focus on flatback turtles. For stranded dead and injured turtles, pathology is used to diagnose the causes of death and injury, with parasite infections and fibropapilloma virus being specifically investigated. For healthy turtles the project has established a blood chemistry reference baseline which can be used nationally by turtle care facilities.  </p>
<p>The outcomes of this project included the first health assessment of sea turtles in Western Australia, including blood chemistry and reference baselines for nesting and in-water flatback turtles. Processes for pathology and pathology descriptions for flatback turtles were developed and personnel across the state were trained. Knowledge transfer to stakeholders included support for the banning of mass balloon releases in WA. A novel disease related to a multiple species mortality event in Broome (fish kill) was identified, as were a new parasite and haemoparasites in flatback turtles. A paper has been published in the journal <em>Diseases of Aquatic Organisms</em>, three draft manuscripts are in preparation.</p>

                                            <p>This research aimed to comprehensively test the influence of climatic and edaphic variation on the performance of genotypes from multiple provenances, to identify best-practice seed sourcing for restoration. Although many strategies for seed sourcing have been proposed, there are few empirical tests of different strategies. In this project, multiple genetic provenances of <em>Banksia menziesii</em>, a restoration priority plant species on the Swan Coastal Plain, were tested in post-mining rehabilitation field sites, as well as glasshouse growth trials where environmental parameters were modified. In addition, physical, chemical and biological properties of soils from these multiple source sites were assessed and compared to the performance of seeds sourced from these sites.</p>
<p>The project is complete and key findings included glasshouse studies that showed seedlings sourced from wetter regions showed higher growth and mortality when exposed to drought, whereas plants from drier seed sources had lower growth and did not show mortality when exposed to drought. Soil microbiome community and physicochemical analyses from remnant populations of <em>Banksia menziesii</em> across its range showed significant correlations between soil microbiome, soil physicochemical and climate distances. Results of a field trial identified that seed from drier provenances did not show superiority under initial field conditions. All results have been interpreted to better inform seed sourcing strategies under changing environmental conditions.</p>

                                            <p>Globally, harmful algal blooms represent a major and growing threat due to their undesirable ecological, economic and health impacts. Since 2019 the Swan Canning has suffered repeated blooms of <em>Alexandrium, a</em> species that produces toxins can cause potentially fatal Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) in humans via consumption of impacted seafood. This project investigates the toxicity and genetics of local <em>Alexandrium</em> while also investigating a potential control method. Risk of exposure to toxins when eating crabs will be investigated by measuring toxin mobility when crabs are cooked. </p>
<p>Investigations into control methods have found that Kaolinite clay with poly-alum chloride additive has superior control potential over bentonite clay. A manuscript reporting the results of this investigation is being finalised. A preliminary trial of crab intoxication and cook-test is currently underway. Protocols for toxin characterisation have been finalised and analysis of cultured strains is on-going.</p>

                                            <p>Ecosystem resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to return to its former state following a disturbance, and is a key factor in evaluating the success of ecological restoration efforts. Resilience is difficult to measure and is unknown for many restored communities. This project investigates the resilience of banksia woodlands restored after sand mining to fire, specifically seeking to determine an age when restoration is resilient to fire. Investigations will assess resprouting capacity and soil seedbank dynamics across a chronosequence of ages between three and 27 years since restoration.</p>
<p>Experimental fire has been introduced to sites across the chronosquence and post-fire regeneration monitored for 1.5 years. Regeneration from soil seedbanks and resprouting was observed, with factors including size, restoration age and soil compaction influencing resprouting success. There is evidence of sites returning to a similar pre-fire state following fire, with some differences in perennial vegetation composition remaining between restored and intact sites.</p>

                                            <p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is endemic to south-west Australia and occupies seasonal wetlands where hydroperiods are shortening due to declining rainfall. Trial assisted colonisation translocations 300-400 kilometres south of their current habitat began in 2016 to test whether <em>P. umbrina</em> can grow in cooler climates where hydroperiods are likely to be more suitable in the future. Early results indicated suitable food availability as a key component. The aims are to 1) develop novel environmental DNA methods to understand diet in new habitats; 2) document foraging behaviour in relation to water temperatures and prey availability; 3) link metabolic processes and food intake to predict long-term growth rates and reproduction in new environments. This will provide greater certainty on whether southern wetlands can provide viable habitat for this critically endangered species in the near future.</p>
<p>Evaluation of juvenile tortoises released into suitable wetlands in an assisted colonisation trial showed increase in body mass over the 2021 and 2022 hydroperiods before moving into aestivation for the summer and autumn months, with a positive relationship between tortoise activity levels and carapace temperature. A highly sensitive environmental DNA (eDNA) test specific to the western swamp tortoise has been developed, which can successfully detect the tortoises at assisted colonisation sites. A molecular dietary analysis is underway to better understand the tortoise&rsquo;s impact on their recipient ecosystem.</p>

                                            <p>Submerged macrophytes play a fundamental role in the functioning of freshwater lakes and rivers providing food, refugia, shade and influencing physico-chemical conditions. A submerged macrophyte community has been an important part of the Canning River Kent Street Weir Pool (KSW) for decades. Recent observations suggest it has disappeared from the weir pool. This project aims to determine the changes in water quality in the weir pool over the last 20 years, determine the historical extent of submerged macrophytes in the weir and investigate reasons for their changes in abundance.  </p>
<p>This research has confirmed that there was no submerged macrophyte community in the KSW and determined that it had been consistently absent since 2017. Changes in light levels, influenced by management of the upgraded weir, were suggested as the likely cause of macrophyte loss. A journal article is in development.</p>

                                            <p>This project aims to examine the effects of cryopreservation on metabolism of plant tissues, with emphasis on mitochondrial function as these organelles are the primary sources of energy molecules (ATP) that drive all cellular processes including the ability to recover from injury sustained to cells and tissues during the various steps of cryopreservation. A better understanding of the effects of cryogenic injury will enable better optimisation of cryopreservation for sensitive species, including many threatened taxa where ex situ storage remains a problem.</p>
<p>Trials measuring oxygen consumption of Daucus carota cells on the Seahorse XF analyser identified that certain cryoprotective agents show a significant negative effect on mitochondrial function. This work was presented at the IV International Symposium on Plant Cryopreservation. Further experiments on the viability of the Seahorse method using respiratory inhibitors to determine the specific parameters of mitochondrial function affected are in progress. The study species will be used to optimise methods for application to threatened species of native WA plants from the Kings Park tissue culture collection.</p>

                                            <p>Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to survey freshwater biodiversity, but complexities of flowing waters can limit interpretation of results in riverine environments. Inferences on species distribution are based on the unidirectional flow with assumptions of how far upstream the source of the DNA might occur. This project aims to measure the movement of a synthetic DNA tracer injected into a river, and the rate of loss with distance from the source. Modelling of the experiment will be conducted to inform how eDNA sampling can be used to inform spatial distributions of biodiversity along river reaches. Outcomes from this research will assist in applying novel eDNA methods to monitor the biodiversity of flowing, freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<p>An experiment has been planned for Southern River and initial measurements of stream morphology and flows have been undertaken to develop a local flow rating curve. The synthetic DNA tracer and primers have been designed, based on American flamingo (<em>Phoenicopterus ruber</em>), and specificity testing is underway to ensure the final tracer will be unique to the experiment environment.</p>

This project aims to understand how the diet of banded and rufous hare-wallabies may influence the outcomes of the ecological restoration of Dirk Hartog Island. </p>
<p>All scat samples chosen for the dietary analysis in this project have had DNA extracted, amplified using two primer sets, and sent for sequencing. Sequencing results have been returned for the first primer set and bioinformatic analysis for these are in progress. Writing has commenced for diet study chapters and a review-style paper/chapter.

                                            <p>In order to optimise the translocation outcomes for the proposed translocation of Shark Bay mice to Dirk Hartog Island, the population genetics of the three extant populations of the species will be investigated. This work will be used in a population viability analysis (PVA) model to inform optimal founder size and ratios, while minimising the impact on the source population(s).</p>
<p>Results of this work found that all three Shark Bay mouse populations have relatively low genetic diversity and differentiation between populations, with marginally more variability present in the original source on Bernier Island. The PVA suggested that the optimal ratio of founders was 80 from Northwest Island and 40-50 from Bernier Island in a female-biased (1.5:1) sex ratio, the first stage of which has now been implemented.</p>

                                            <p><em>Syzygium paniculatum</em> and <em>Syzygium australe</em> are two rainforest species with recalcitrant seeds that are not storable by seed banking, with <em>S. paniculatum</em> currently threatened in its native habitat. The objective of this project is to develop a viable cryopreservation protocol for these species. Tissue cultured shoots offer an alternative explant source for cryopreservation and <em>ex situ</em> conservation of these and other threatened recalcitrant-seeded Australian species. <em>Syzygium</em> species have a strong tolerance to long incubation times in cryoprotective agents (CPAs) but exhibit a complete lack of survival following liquid nitrogen exposure, which could indicate that post-cryogenic failure is primarily due to either insufficient vitrification promotion and/or insufficient suppression of ice formation. Thermo-analytical assessments (differential scanning calorimetry) measured the extent of ice formation in shoot tissues, permitting differentiation between cell death by actual ice damage and other stress factors such as CPA toxicity and reactive oxygen species damage. </p>

                                            <p>Fire is a dominant disturbance that shapes species and ecosystems. Many plant species have developed strategies and adaptations to cope with certain fire regimes. If fire occurs too frequently, too intensely, or otherwise outside of the limits of a species' tolerance, then populations are likely to decline or disappear. This project aims to determine the impact of varying fire regimes on the demographics of key banksia woodland plant species.</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis have been completed. Demographic surveys have identified changes in population size structures, flowering and canopy seed bank accumulation for six woody plant species. Some species have evidence of inter-fire recruitment. Juvenile periods ranged from 1.3-4.1 years and varied by fire response, seed bank storage mode and growth form. Canopy seed banks were not observed to accumulate over time, consistent with observations of weak serotiny in banksia woodlands. A field experiment showed how timing of seed planting throughout the year (emulating the timing of fire) influences seedling recruitment, where recruitment is best when seeds are cued for germination immediately prior to winter rainfall. One review paper (on fire season effect mechanisms) and one experimental paper (on fire seasonal germination and emergence patterns) have been published. Papers on population structure and reproductive patterns are in late draft. </p>

Data are used to analyse the turtles&rsquo; fine-scale vertical and horizontal movements at a foraging ground. </p>
<p>Three papers were published describing flatback diving behaviour at their foraging ground and predator interaction that inform dynamic spatial management of this species in Roebuck Bay Marine Park. Tide and season have been found to strongly impact the turtles' behaviour in the bay. Detailed maps are being produced to help management.  A final paper is in preparation and involves incorporating behaviour into habitat suitability modelling in a case study for sea turtles at foraging sites.</p>

                                            <p>This research is focussed on understanding feral cat spatial ecology, diet and their impacts on native species in four study sites on the south coast of Western Australia. This research will also test the effectiveness of stable isotope analysis for increasing understanding of feral cat dietary niche and impact on native species. The relationship between prey availability and climate and productivity indices will be studied in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve.</p>
<p>Strong evidence of an ongoing impact of feral cats on native mammals and passerines was found in major conservation areas and fragmented landscapes on the south coast. Both isotopic niche and mixing models validated stomach content analysis and provided insights into feral cat diet over extended time periods. Mixing models using 13C and 15N tracers provided evidence of feral cat predation on the critically endangered western ground parrot (<em>Pezoporus flaviventris</em>), which was not detected in stomach content analysis.</p>
<p>Feral cat habitat preferences were found to be similar to those in other areas of Australia, with moisture gaining sites and regions of high productivity important areas to target in management programs. Areas of native vegetation provided significant refuge value in fragmented landscapes. Investigations into prey availability found that climatic variables and dynamic habitat indices, derived from remote sensed data, could be used to predict small mammal trap success and available biomass. These findings provide insights that can be used to improve timing of control efforts, such as cat baiting, in an adaptive management framework.</p>

                                            <p>This project investigated the potential of eDNA to monitor fish in the Canning River. It compared fish assembly data from traditional fyke netting, active filtration eDNA and passively collected eDNA to explore the sensitivity of eDNA survey techniques for monitoring native and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems. The influence of biotic factors (including length) and the environment (pool volume) on eDNA detection of fish was analysed.</p>
<p>DNA extractions, PCR analysis and sequencing of samples collected from 10 sites between dams and weirs is complete. A paper is currently being finalised, using additional sequencing data for the reference library. The study demonstrated that eDNA can detect a wide range of fish taxa and is less labour-intensive than fyke netting. The project also highlighted significant gaps in the reference database for Western Australian freshwater species, providing guidance for expanding the reference library for freshwater macrofauna in south-western Australia.</p>

                                            <p>Aerial survey is a standard technique used in wildlife management to estimate population abundance and detect trends.  It is particularly useful for species with large ranges and broad distribution patterns, such as marine mammals, as the technique allows relatively large areas to be covered over short periods of time. While aerial surveys are typically designed for specific target species, additional species are often recorded as surveys are generally infrequent due to expense and logistical constraints. Analyses to estimate abundance of non-target species recorded during surveys can have limitations as information recorded for these species may be constrained or incomplete. In this study, analysis of aerial survey data collected in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, will be extended beyond the target species (dolphins) and applied to humpback whale (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) abundance estimation. While the survey was designed for distance sampling abundance estimation of dolphins, a strip transect approach was taken for humpback whales, and a maximum strip width was not defined. This study will evaluate various strip width estimates derived from the detection functions of comparable cues and a field based trial.  An absolute abundance estimate for humpback whales will be calculated using strip-transect based methods, with corrections for availability and perception bias. The methods used here will be evaluated through comparison of these estimates with those derived from photographs taken during the survey, which have a known strip width. The relative density distribution of the species within the area will also be mapped and evaluated. The results of this study will update current knowledge on the abundance and distribution of key marine mammals with a focus on humpback whales in Exmouth Gulf, to inform ongoing monitoring and management of this &lsquo;conservation dependant' population. </p>
<p>The aerial imagery has been compiled and reviewed to address the biases inherent in aerial survey data. This has included conducting an additional single day of aerial survey to detertmine detection function and strip width for the analysis. The results are being written up.</p>

                                            <p>The western grasswren (<em>Amytornis textilis</em>) is restricted to Shark Bay in Western Australia and is listed as Priority Four. The Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological Restoration Project seeks to reintroduce a suite of locally extinct fauna to the island, including the grasswren. However, the western grasswren is probably the most poorly studied of all these species and little is known about its genetics or behaviour. The aim of this project is to investigate the population genetics and behavioural ecology of this cryptic bird species. </p>
<p>Main project outputs included developing ethical guidelines for harvesting individuals  and completion of the population viability analysis. There was also an update on the population genetic analysis using updated SNP data, as well as provide finer scale detail about where to harvest individuals from to capture as much genetic diversity as possible in the founder population. All analysis conducted provided guidance on aspects of the translocation of western grasswren to Dirk Hartog Island. Two manuscripts have been published. </p>

                                            <p>Plant mortality in restoration programs leads to reduced outcomes for biodiversity and is costly for practitioners. Understanding the drivers of mortality, in particular factors influencing soil water availability, is critical. Wind dynamics play a significant role in drying soils and creating atmospheric deficits whereby plants lose water. In altered systems such as restoration environments, the wind dynamics may be different compared to reference communities, and may impact seedling establishment. This project aims to capture reference wind dynamics of many Western Australian ecosystems including the banksia woodland ecosystem, and compare restoration sites to the reference state. Understanding the critical thresholds for wind dynamics and the impacts on plant physiological performance will be assessed for <em>Banksia</em> species.</p>
<p>This study investigated canopy flow in native Australian vegetation and post-mine restoration systems. Implications for altered wind dynamics were used to understand plant functioning <em>in altered environments</em>, providing a significant insight into the role of wind as an abiotic factor in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>

                                            <p>According to ecological theory, sympatric species cannot occupy the same niche space. Therefore, the coexistence of sympatric species is thought to be facilitated by the partitioning of resources, differing patterns of habitat utilisation, or both. However, in the tropical savannas of northern Australia 3 sympatric grass finches co-exist. It is thought that the threatened Gouldian finch has a specialised diet of grass seeds and also morphological adaptations for greater dispersal. In contrast, the more common Long-tailed and Masked Finches have a generalist diet, including a greater range of herbaceous seeds and invertebrates, and are also more sedentary in their habitat use and movements. Fire regimes leading to increased movements to locate specialist food resources may increase risks to Gouldian finches, including starvation and/or lost body condition. This study uses stable isotope analysis and novel radio telemetry methods to test hypotheses on diet specialisation, and foraging behaviour in the Kimberley savanna as resource bottlenecks increase as grass seeds become more scarce into the late dry season.</p>
<p>Analyses showed that Gouldian finches visited waterholes less often per day than other finches, leading to over-estimations of some species. Consistent with predictions based on wing length/diet, Gouldian finches dispersed more, and spent less time at foraging sites as seed density declined through the dry season. Masked and long-tailed finches changed diet instead of increasing searches for grass seeds. Gouldian finches preferentially foraged where prescribed burning had occurred, and grass seeds were denser. Late dry season and wet season burnt, and long unburnt habitats were not selected by finches. Two papers were published, another has been accepted and two draft papers are in development.</p>

<p>Eight pressure loggers deployed in nearshore and offshore areas between December 2022 and June 2023 have been retrieved and downloaded. Available datasets have been analysed to identify durations of significant storm surges and boat wakes, as well as durations for wave energy attenuation investigation. Matlab routine for calculating wave properties including wave energy has been created. Next steps include finalizing the wave attenuation dataset, applying appropriate time periods for analysis of durations of storms surges and boat wakes, and calculation of wave energy using wave by wave analysis. </p>

                                            <p>The red-tailed phascogale, <em>Phascogale calura</em>, is listed as conservation-dependent. Due to their highly fragmented and restricted habitat in south-west Western Australia, understanding their genetic structure and diversity can inform conservation action. This study aims to 1) assess genetic structure across wild reserve populations, 2) assess genetic diversity within reserves, 3) determine the genetic outcome of a previous mixed wild-to-wild translocation to Kojonup reserve, and 4) estimate effective wild global population size.</p>
<p>Genomic analysis was completed for 208 samples from 9 reserves. An isolation by distance model best explained the genetic structure, with similar levels of genetic diversity reserves, and no populations showed signs of inbreeding or strong genetic drift. Although Kojonup has retained the diversity of the wider species, the source populations were unevenly represented. Although populations appear to retain connectivity currently, global effective population size was low (Ne 48-117) suggesting the species is vulnerable to future genetic diversity loss.</p>

                                            <p>Translocations are a key conservation recovery action for threatened plant species and determining their success is an important aspect of ongoing management. This project is investigating the success of translocation in <em>Banksia brownii</em> and <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa</em> and aims to: (1) compare the mating systems and genetic diversity of translocated populations with wild populations (2) determine how reproductive output and progeny performance of translocated populations compares to wild populations and (3) assess the efficacy of using measures of mating system parameters, genetic diversity and reproductive potential to better understand translocation success. The findings have a number of potential implications for not only assessing long term translocation success, but also improving translocation design and establishment technologies.</p>
<p>Analysis has been completed for genetic diversity, mating system analysis, reproductive output and progeny performance data for <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa</em> and a chapter drafted. A journal article on genetic diversity, mating systems, reproductive output and pollination analysis (for one translocated <em>B. brownii</em> population and four wild populations) has been published in <em>Australian Journal of Botany </em>(Mar 2023). An additional paper using the <em>Banksia brownii</em> genetic material collections and also trait data, co-authored with researchers from Monash University has been submitted to <em>Restoration Ecology</em>. A third paper on comparison of <em>B. brownii</em> progeny fitness traits from a translocated population with those from wild populations is in draft.</p>

The project will develop a method to identify the polymers of these tiny plastics and investigate the presence of microplastics in the digestive systems of fish and determine the potential harm caused by these materials. </p>
<p>An extensive review of the literature has been undertaken and a pilot trail completed to test and refine water and beach sampling methods. Eight quarterly sampling events at 38 beach sites and four estuary regions have been completed. Analytical methods for plastic fragment identification have been developed and sample processing has commenced. The literature review is being developed into a journal article.</p>

                                            <p>This project aimed to identify the major correlates of population changes in four critical weight range mammals (woylie, chuditch, koomal, quenda) in the Upper Warren region of Western Australia, including fire history, logging history, climate and weather variation and predator management.</p>
<p>First, this project modelled the associations between red fox and feral cat occurrence and fox baiting intensity, prey abundance and rainfall. Second, this project used structural equation modelling to identify primary productivity and habitat extent as key drivers of historical population change for woylie, chuditch, koomal and quenda populations, and rainfall declines and severe fire as potential drivers of future population declines. Lastly, the project used multi-species abundance modelling and optimisation analyses to demonstrate how fire and red fox management strategies might be optimised to maximise the abundance of species of conservation concern in the Upper Warren. The outcomes of this project demonstrate that managers need to consider the complexity of ecosystems and their local context when designing conservation interventions, and this must be done in an adaptive framework so that management can be continuously improved.</p>

                                            <p>Plant physiological condition is a key indicator in the early stages of restoration progress assessment. Current methods to determine condition are difficult to undertake over large areas and are time-consuming. This research project aims to determine if near-surface remote sensing measurements (particularly hyperspectral sensing and thermography) can reliably quantify plant drought stress condition in a biodiverse plant community. Quantitative criteria will be proposed to evaluate restoration success by defining a fast, accurate, and easy to perform methodology, potentially establishing the foundation for scaling up remote imaging platforms that allow monitoring of larger areas in shorter timeframes.</p>
<p>Experiments were completed in glasshouse and filed conditions to explore hyperspectral reflectance (measured with a field spectrometer) as a predictor of plant water status, plant water content, pigment content and maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II, as well as leaf temperature (measured through thermal imagery) to predict stomatal conductance. This approach has now been applied to Banksia woodland restoration sites where five functionally distinct plant species were monitored over 15 months.</p>

                                            <p>The status of local populations of a species must be assessed prior to further supplementary translocations. Brushtail possums were reintroduced to the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area in 2007 under the assumption that the local population was extinct. Concerns were raised about potential bottlenecking of sub-populations of the translocated possums in 2017. This project investigated whether viable genetic material could be collected from brushtail possums in the arid zone via baited tracking tunnels; whether there is ongoing evidence of inbreeding or genetic bottlenecking in the brushtail possum population on Matuwa; and whether the phylogenetics of brushtail possums in the arid zone can be assessed through fecal or hair DNA collected through non-invasive techniques.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, viable DNA could not be extracted from either tracking tunnels or relatively fresh possum scats collected near trees. DNA was extracted from two out of 20 preserved possum skins held by the WA Museum, one from Cranbrook and a second from Bendering. Structure analysis of DNA taken from translocated possums suggests considerable genetic admixture between founder populations has occurred. Principal components analysis suggests that the population at Matuwa is significantly different to animals from Cranbrook.</p>

                                            <p>This project is working with the Wadandi people of the Busselton/Margaret River region to understand the cultural significance and traditional use of the Kalloora (Emu Plum, <em>Podocarpus drouynianus</em>) in southwestern Australia. This project also includes a genetic study to assess the health and population dynamics of the species that will inform its future management and long-term preservation.</p>
<p>Genetic samples have been sequenced for both SNP markers and chloroplast DNA markers and the data have been analysed. Sequencing nuclear data from gymnosperms is often challenging due to their complex genomes and unfortunately, the SNP data exhibited low resolution; nevertheless, it showed a general pattern of low genetic differentiation amongst populations across the species' main distribution in the southern Jarrah forests, in contrast to the more differentiated disjunct populations located in the Swan region. This geographic pattern was consistent with that shown in the results from the chloroplast genome. In addition, the chloroplast data showed high levels of haplotype diversity within and among populations and no phylogeographic structure, indicating historically large population sizes and high gene flow, with no indication of contraction to refugia through historical climate fluctuations. </p>

This work aims to determine if there are differences in the amount of plastic washing down the major drainage lines. In addition, this work will determine the types of plastic commonly washing down the drains into the estuary, providing vital knowledge for the Plastic Free Riverpark Program to identify priority catchments for remediation work.</p>
<p>Sampling has now been completed at six catchment sites, three in the Canning catchment and three in the Swan catchment. Sampling was undertaken over three time periods, winter storm event, winter base flow and first major flush event. Samples from the major flow event are still being processed. Data has been collated for the winter base flow and winter flow event samples. A report is in preparation.</p>

                                            <p>The jarrah (<em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>) and karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>) forests of south-west Western Australia provide a variety of values including timber, wildlife habitat and water. However, as climate changes, issues of forest productivity, tree health and mortality, and water yield need to be addressed. Individual-based modelling (IBM) is an ecological modelling approach that represents individuals within populations or communities, and the interactions between them, with a relatively high level of detail and complexity. This study aims to develop an IBM of tree growth in water limited environments, to parameterise the model for jarrah and karri and to predict the impact of tree thinning on timber production, tree health and mortality and water yield using time series data collected from 1965 and 1992, respectively.</p>
<p>This research has shown that thinning has a positive impact on the growth of both species, with stand growth optimised at intermediate densities (10-20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) over multi-decadal time periods, consistent with findings from previous studies. Thinning also influences allometry of stem diameter with height, ratio of height and diameter, crown width and bark thickness. Two papers were published: the first on the effect of thinning on growth and allometry of karri was published in <em>Southern Forests</em> and the second investigating the effects of above and below ground competition in jarrah and karri forests was published in <em>Forest Ecology and Management</em>.</p>

                                            <p>This project aimed to predict the vulnerability of flatback turtle rookeries on the North West Shelf to increasing sand temperatures, sea level rise and increased storm frequency. It has provided critical information for the management of marine turtles and their rookeries by assessing vulnerability and long-term conservation value of different nesting sites and determine if there is need for human intervention.</p>
<p>A paper has been accepted for publication in <em>Ecosphere</em>. The paper describes the vulnerability of flatback turtle rookeries to erosion and inundation and provides a decision tool for the NWSFTCP to make management decisions for this flatback stock. A presentation about these results was made at the 58<sup>th</sup> Australian Marine Sciences Association Conference.</p>

This information will assist in informing future management and translocation practices for woylies, and potentially other critical weight range species.</p>
<p>Anti-predator behaviours have been compared in two populations of woylies at Dryandra and Perup. An experimental release of woylies has been conducted to investigate survival consequences of weakened anti-predator responses, adaptability of behaviours over time, and implications for conservation translocations and management.</p>

<p>An optimised cryopreservation method for wild type <em>A. thaliana</em> has been developed using vitamin C- and GSH-deficient mutant plants (vtc2-1, vtc2-4, pad2-1 and cad2), to assess changes in transcriptome using RNA-seq. Assessments of the transcriptome, gene expression by RT-qPRC, oxidized DNA damage and antioxidant contents have been completed to understand the stresses imposed by cryopreservation. All experiments are completed and writing is underway.</p>

                                            <p>Issues arising from habitat fragmentation are exacerbated by a warming and drying climate, land use changes and invasive species. To maintain biodiversity, various management methods are employed, such as prescribing burning or herbicide application. Many of these strategies are macro-organism focused, with less attention paid to microorganisms. Soil fungi play instrumental roles in ecosystem functioning, yet in many ecosystems little is known about how soil fungi respond to prescribed burning and weed control. The Swan Coastal Plain&rsquo;s Banksia woodland is one such ecosystem where there is a gap in knowledge. This project will help fill that knowledge gap and better inform management decisions.</p>
<p>All planned analyses have been completed and journal manuscripts drafted, to answer four key questions regarding the responses of soil fungal communities to 1) time since fire over a 50-year chronosequence, 2) time since fire within the first year, 3) fire and herbicide under field conditions, and 4) a range of herbicides under glasshouse conditions. A breadth of fungal sequences (~20,000) has been identified, with various taxonomic and functional information being assigned. Results suggest that the soil fungal community is very dynamic in the early months of recovery in the post fire environment, but over time it gradually increases in diversity but decreases in relative abundance before plateauing ~30 years post-fire. Herbicide application has complex effects on the soil fungal community within field applications suppressing all observed metrics, but <em>ex-situ </em>application of a herbicide increased abundance and richness, especially of pathogenic species.</p>

Microorganisms have been widely reported to be beneficial for agricultural crops for example through growth stimulation, increased nutrient uptake and plant tolerance against abiotic stress such as drought induced by microbial phytohormone and enzyme signals. Some of these beneficial microorganisms are also present in natural soil systems, however, their role in facilitating seedling establishment is yet to be identified. This project aims to investigate if microorganisms known to benefit agricultural species can be applied to Western Australian natural systems via inoculations. The project also aims to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the positive effects of microorganisms on plants and explore how these findings can be integrated to improve mine site restoration strategies.</span></p>
<p>The results of the project demonstrated rather limited beneficial effects of the selected microbial inoculants on the tested native plant species and highlights that further research is required before advocating the use of commercial microbial inoculant in post-mining ecological restoration. The work also provided an approach to evaluate the use of commercial microbial inoculants through method development and experimental approaches that will be useful for future research.</p>

                                            <p>Robust population estimates are fundamental to species conservation and management. This project aims to use lured remote sensor cameras and spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modelling to improve the accuracy of density estimates for chuditch populations.</p>
<p>Spatial distribution of cameras was investigated for chuditch. Results suggested the use of paired cameras set horizontally at 30 cm off the ground with a grid of spacing of 1 km between sites. Comparing two spatial layouts, a grid and a road array, showed that while both layouts produced similar density estimates, but the grid was more reliable. To test the broadscale suitability of a 1 km grid, cameras were deployed in three additional locations: Dryandra National Park, Batalling State Forest and Moopinup Forest Block, and in Julimar to detect changes in chuditch detections over time. Via simulation, the reliability of the density estimates from these deployments are being used to determine adjustments to location-specific surveys to improve reliability.</p>

                                            <p>Salt lakes are a distinctive feature of Western Australian inland areas. Several invertebrate groups appear to be far more diverse in Western Australia than anywhere else in Australia and even globally, probably reflecting the long history of aridification and the now disjunct occurrence of this type of wetland in the State. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing (especially in the Wheatbelt) and increasingly, by mining on or near the lake bed. The first goal of the project is to use mitochondrial DNA data and, if necessary, nuclear DNA data, to assess the validity of the morpho-taxonomy of genus <em>Australocypris</em> and to examine mytilocyprdine systematics generally. The second goal is to use molecular data to test alternative hypotheses about species radiations in <em>Australocypris</em>. The final goal is to develop a protocol for hatching and raising adult ostracods from resting eggs in mud samples collected from dry lakes, as a substitute for collecting active ostracods.</p>
<p>A review article on giant ostracods has been published in <em>Marine and Freshwater Research</em>. Extensive genetic analyses have been conducted and a manuscript on the systematics of mytilocypridine ostracods is in preparation. Investigations into the phylogeography and evolutionary history of <em>Australocypris </em>ostracods has been completed and a draft manuscript completed. An experimental analysis of hatching conditions for mytilocypridine eggs has been carried out and analyses completed. A manuscript  is nearing completion.</p>

                                            <p>Australia has many salt lakes that support a diverse range of invertebrates. Crustaceans are particularly dominant and many species, genera, and even some families are endemic to these environments. The brine shrimp genus <em>Parartemia</em> is a good example, being one of the most diverse, common, and salt-tolerant groups of invertebrates that only occurs in Australian salt lakes. This research focuses on brine shrimp in Australia, with three main aims: 1) use mitochondrial and nuclear markers to evaluate the current morpho-taxonomy of <em>Parartemia</em>, 2) use molecular data to understand the evolutionary history and phylogeography of <em>Parartemia</em>, and 3) examine the distribution and phylogeography of the introduced <em>Artemia</em> in Australia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A manuscript reviewing knowledge of <em>Parartemia</em> is nearing completion. Extensive sampling of COI, 16S and 28S sequences have provided evidence of some new species and conspecific morphotypes within <em>Parartemia </em>and a phylogenetics manuscript is in preparation. Writing is in progress for a phylogeography manuscript. Genetic markers (both mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS-1) are being used to trace the origins and spread of <em>Artemia</em> lineages in Australia. All fieldwork, lab work, and data analyses have been completed, and the writing of this thesis chapter is currently underway.</p>

                                            <p>Salt lakes are an iconic feature of Western Australian semi-arid and arid landscapes. Western Australia has a particularly diverse halophilic fauna. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing and, increasingly, by mining. One of the most intriguing invertebrate groups is the snail genus <em>Coxiella</em>, which tolerates periodic drying and high salinities and is the only mollusc occurring in temporarily filled salt lakes. This project focusses on the phylogenetics, phylogeography and physiology of this genus.</p>
<p>A taxonomic assessment of <em>Coxiella</em> has identified 14 species, with 6 considered to be new. This study also included <em>Tomichia </em>from South Africa and <em>Idiopyrgus </em>from South America and confirmed that these plus <em>Coxiella</em> form a family with Gondwanan origins. The phylogeographic study suggested diversification of <em>Coxiella</em> began during the early to mid-Miocene, followed by speciation during the mid to late Miocene and diversification within species during the Pliocene/Pleistocene. Analyses indicated that phylogeographic structure and genetic diversity vary according to biogeography and climatic history. Species exhibited two broad patterns consistent with their distributions in relation to rainfall. Results of salinity tolerance experiments suggested that all <em>Coxiella </em>species can persist across a wide range of salinities (at least 5 &ndash; 90 mS/cm) but upper limits vary between species. <em>Coxiella </em>n. sp 2, in particular, was able to tolerate ~ 135 mS/cm, suggesting that this species may be one of the most salt tolerant gastropods globally.</p>

                                            <p>The captive breeding for release program at Perth Zoo for the Western Swamp Tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) makes an essential contribution to the species&rsquo; long-term conservation prospects. In doing so, the program has generated a considerable database on the biology of the captive population. This study investigated retrospective data collected across a total of 9 breeding seasons (years) to determine the factors that influence the species&rsquo; growth and reproduction in captivity.</p>
<p>Diet was the main factor focussed on since nutrition provision is a key husbandry area that is made difficult trying to replicate a species&rsquo; highly specialised wild diet in captivity to a large-scale breeding program. Minor nutritional differences were found between the predominantly red-meat and white-meat only captive diets; the white diet had slightly higher protein and protein to energy ratio, while the red diet had a higher fat content. Captive diets fed to offspring did not show consistent differences for all juvenile growth or aestivation periods. Where differences did occur, the red diet yielded a significantly higher specific growth rate than the white diet. Captive diet fed to breeding females was a more prevalent factor across the reproductive variables with a general, but again not consistent, trend of (where it occurred) the white diet having significantly higher reproductive performance than the red diet. Given the species resilience to reproduce and grow in captivity regardless of minimal nutritional differences, the white captive diet is recommended as more appropriate to the breeding program overall. Of all the factors examined, the variability between breeding seasons was the most consistently significant difference for growth and reproductive variables. These findings considered together highlight the multi-factorial relationship between nutrition, growth and reproduction and the areas still needing further research, like environmental factors in captive breeding settings themselves.</p>

<p>All experimental work has been completed including research to (1) understand germination thresholds of semi-arid restoration priority species, (2) investigate how preconditioning seedlings to water stress influences tolerance to subsequent drought in restoration substrates, and (3) understand how propagule type, substrate and water availability influence establishment in restoration environments.

                                            <p>The northern quoll (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) is a nocturnal mesopredator threatened by habitat loss due to mining in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and the impacts of mining on the movement and behaviour of northern quolls are poorly known. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap and identify the movement and behaviour of northern quolls living in mining landscapes.</p>
<p>Northern quolls living in the mining landscape situated their broad movement ranges in areas with high proportions of remnant rocky habitat and used all other habitats in proportion to their availability, including mining habitats. On a fine scale, quolls avoided mining habitats relative to rocky habitat in breeding season but used mining habitats at a similar rate to rocky habitat in non-breeding season. This increased use of mining habitats resulted in an increased energetic cost for quolls, potentially leading to sublethal effects such as decreased body condition. The investigation of animal abundances around mining camps using camera traps is ongoing, with all fieldwork completed and image identification and analyses underway.</p>

                                            <p>The aim of this project is to increase knowledge about the baseline population and spatial ecology of the numbat population in the Upper Warren region. This information will assist in informing future management practices for this population.</p>
<p>SECR design modelling, based on parameters from a field study, suggests a survey design based on static grids of 6x6 or 7x7 cameras, using Swift 3C wide angle cameras and deployed for between 60-80 days can be used to monitor numbat population trends. Numbats showed selectivity on a macro- and microhabitat scale relating to soil type, distance to a water source, distance from roads, time since timber harvesting, prescribed burning, hollow logs; based on GPS tracking technology. Median female home range size was 29.5 ha in spring and 32.7 ha in autumn (n=13 females). The home range of the two males that were tracked was 80.2 ha and 278.7 ha. A population viability analysis for the Upper Warren indicates the population is most sensitive to mortality rates of females and juveniles. Simulated scenarios suggest increased mortality rates and reduction of carrying capacity due to increased firewood collection, reduced predator control and increased effect of prescribed burning could result in a large drop in population size.</p>

                                            <p>This project examines predator-prey interactions between ghost crabs and hatchling sea turtles on the Ningaloo coast and the Pilbara to better conserve threatened turtle species and manage a native predator. It provides critical information regarding the potential impact of native ghost crabs on turtle eggs and hatchling survival. Results are helping assess the vulnerability of different nesting sites and determine if there is a need for human intervention.</p>
<p>Two papers have been submitted to peer-reviewed journals. The results suggest that &lt;20% of the eggs laid at <em>C. caretta</em> rookeries on the Ningaloo coast successfully hatch and survive the beach crawl to the water mark. Nest inventories implicated native ghost crabs (<em>Ocypode</em> spp.) as the main egg predator at both locations. Additionally, hatchlings were directly and indirectly preyed on via ghost crabs by silver gulls. Predation rates found in this study were higher than those in most studies across the globe. Thus, conservation strategies to reduce predation of <em>C. Caretta</em> eggs and hatchlings in teh region seem urgently needed. Results from this project are being used to determine what the next management actions should be in regard to the high level of predation sustained by the Western Australia loggerhead turtle stock.</p>
