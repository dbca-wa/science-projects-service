            <p>Our Biodiversity and Conservation Science report for 2022-23 highlights once again our delivery of the government&rsquo;s commitment to build and share biodiversity knowledge to support conservation and nature-based tourism in Western Australia. This is achieved through world-class applied science that informs conservation and management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>
<p>Our consolidated &nbsp;Biodiversity and Conservation Science function continues to support business areas across the agency to achieve the department&rsquo;s Strategic Directions 2022-2025 by providing scientific excellence to support biodiversity conservation and nature-based tourism.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science provides innovative science through the technical expertise and capability of our science staff and the excellent support of our administration staff. The challenges we are facing as a society are impacting all of us and &nbsp;our staff continue to show their professionalism in the face of ongoing challenges. Our Conservation Science Forum in June focused on recognising and developing our people and knowledge leadership capabilities, fostering inclusion and diversity, supporting each other particularly when things seem overwhelming, and bringing open mindsets to maximise our collaborative and innovative approaches while celebrating how science supports delivery of key priorities of the department. I continue to be enormously proud of the Biodiversity and Conservation Science team and what we achieve together and with our partners.</p>
<p>Our collaborative and innovative science supports the current priorities of the department in providing knowledge and advice for delivering Plan for Our Parks, the Aboriginal Ranger program, joint management arrangements, response to climate change and renewed forest management. Other highlights of our scientific achievements this year include developing new remote area mangrove monitoring methods for use in the Kimberley Marine Parks; understanding the relationship between soil depth and tolerance to drought in jarrah; the first translocations of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo back to Two Peoples Bay National Park; the first listing of threatened ecological communities under the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>; resolving the hybrid status of two threatened eucalypt species; the first successful captive breeding of the Critically Endangered hairy marron; establishing a &lsquo;living seawalls&rsquo; trial in the Swan River; ingesting more than 2.8 million biodiversity recordsinto Dandjoo; conducting the first in-water coral and fish surveys at Bardi Jawi Garri Marine Park; and undertaking the largest threatened orchid translocation project in WA.</p>
<p>The Conferences of the Parties for Climate and Biological Diversity continue to identify the combined challenges of climate change and biodiversity decline, and the innovative science required to assist society in addressing these issues. We have new resources to work on these areas through a Climate Adaptation initiative, a changed focus on forest management in a drying climate, science to implement the Feral Cat Strategy, and biodiversity and spatial data to contribute to effective regional planning under the Native Vegetation Policy.</p>
<p>Our work is strengthened by our collaborations and partnerships both internally and externally. We continue to work collectively with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and Rottnest Island. We engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the National Environmental Science Program hubs. Co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students is evidence of our wide ranging science partnerships and we value these opportunities to work with and inspire the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage with all our partners to provide scientific excellence to support the department&rsquo;s functions and contribute to delivery of the biodiversity science priorities for Western Australia. The scientific information we generate and the biodiversity knowledge we provide is fundamental to ensuring the unique biodiversity we have around us is conserved, valued and appreciated through our natural attractions.</p>

                                    <p>Barrow Island Nature Reserve is one of Australia's most important conservation reserves, particularly for mammal and marine turtle conservation. It has also been the site of a producing oil field since 1964. In 2003, the Western Australian Government approved the development of the Gorgon gas field off the north west of Barrow Island and associated LNG plant on Barrow Island subject to several environmental offset conditions. One of these offsets was the threatened and priority fauna translocation program that provided for the translocation of selected Barrow Island fauna species to other secure island and mainland sites. This will assist in improving the conservation status of these species and allow the reconstruction of the fauna in some areas. It also provides an opportunity to examine the factors affecting translocation success and improve these where necessary. Targeted species are the golden bandicoot, brushtail possum, spectacled hare-wallaby, boodie, black and white fairy-wren, and spinifex bird.</p>

<li class="p1">Based on the core habitat of 19 species (identified with SDM), maps of species richness were generated for the Pilbara. Three guilds of small-medium-sized mammal species were identified, reflecting&nbsp;species with preferences for rocky habitat, high aridity, or spinifex and weathered areas. This work is in preparation for publication.</li>
<li>Genetically informed connectivity modelling across eight small-medium-sized mammal species was completed, revealing that dispersal in rocky specialists was less restricted than for generalists and sand specialists across the Pilbara landscape. For the latter, the Fortescue Marsh is a major dispersal corridor.</li>

                                    <p>The critically endangered night parrot has been confirmed breeding in only two locations, one in Queensland and one in Western Australia. The night parrot has not been adequately surveyed across much of its potential habitat, and a lack of knowledge of foraging and roosting habits has hampered progress in understanding the ecology of the species. This constrains possible recovery actions and management relating to resource development proposals. Identifying the conservation requirements of the night parrot is essential for informed management of this poorly known species.</p>

<li>A review of the northern quoll research program, published in <em>Australian Mammalogy</em>, found that the program has substantially improved our knowledge of Pilbara northern quolls, particularly in relation to effective survey and monitoring techniques, the influence of habitat quantity, configuration, and composition on occupancy, movement ecology, population dynamics and structure, and the threat posed by introduced predators.</li>
<li>An analysis of northern quoll fine-scale habitat, published in <em>Australian Mammalogy</em>, found that quolls selected habitats that were topographically rugged, and characterised by a higher percentage cover of rocky habitat and riverbed, and a lower percentage cover of spinifex sandplain.</li>
<li>An analysis comparing the efficiency of new (camera traps) and conventional (live trapping) survey methods in terms of cost and statistical power in tracking occupancy declines in northern quolls, published in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>, indicated that camera traps can detect declines of 30%, 50% and 80% at a reduced cost when compared to live trap designs, without compromising statistical power.</li>
<li>A complementary paper published in <em>Conservation Science and Practice</em>, discussed the implementation of improved quoll monitoring methods and the benefits associated with involving local stakeholders.</li>
<li>An analysis exploring the relationship between northern quoll habitat suitability and mean population fitness, published in <em>Wildlife Research,</em>&nbsp;indicated that mean population fitness increased with increasing habitat suitability, increasing topographic ruggedness, annual rainfall, rainfall variability, and decreasing distance to water.</li>
<li>Northern quolls were detected on the Burrup Peninsula for the first time in almost 10 years, as part of collaborative monitoring efforts with the Murujuga Rangers.</li>

                                    <p>Feral cats are one of the most significant threats to native terrestrial vertebrate species in Australia. The Felixer&trade; cat grooming trap is a novel method of controlling feral cats that takes advantage of their compulsive grooming behaviour. The Felixer unit detects the presence of a feral cat and sprays a lethal dose of 1080 toxic gel onto the fur of the feral cat. The feral cat instinctively grooms itself to remove the gel and, in doing so, ingests a lethal dose of the poison. The unit takes a photograph every time the detection beams are crossed, allowing an assessment of the efficacy of the trap in differentiating feral cats from non-target species.</p>
<p>Proper testing of this new technology is essential to validate if the Felixer is an effective and low-risk feral cat management tool and at what scale they are most effective. This project is a research trial to assess the effectiveness of these traps to deliver feral cat control at a meso-spatial scale (around 10,000 ha) for threatened fauna conservation and recovery. The trials are being conducted in high conservation value areas in and around the Tone-Perup Nature Reserve and the Lake Muir-Byenup Ramsar site.</p>

<li>Trials of DBCA conditioned taste aversion baits resulted in equivocal results, with small numbers of quolls persisting on both control and treatment sites after the arrival of cane toads. The differences are being carefully teased out using video and camera footage to understand how quolls interact with the baits.</li>
<li>CTA baits were found to be effective at inducing quoll avoidance of the baits and toad legs. Results from this work and research by others suggests that quolls do not remember their taste aversion experience for a long period (weeks). Therefore, it is important that aerial drops of CTA baits occur both early, and at other times in the wet season, so that quolls have likely encountered a CTA bait a short time before they meet their first toad.</li>

                                    <p>Comprehensive information about the distribution, abundance and genetic diversity of the chuditch in Western Australia is lacking. Information to date has largely been captured using Western Shield monitoring, and while this has provided some data for selected locations, the monitoring sites and methods used are designed to capture information on a range of species. Consequently, captures of chuditch are often sparse and monitoring is not comprehensive across its distribution. Analysis of Western Shield data suggests that there has been a significant decline in the relative abundance of chuditch in the period 2013-17, although inconsistent trap effort in some years may have confounded this result. Further analyses suggested that the currently sparse data could not provide reliable population size estimates for the species. This project will undertake targeted surveys in poorly sampled areas to fill information gaps using an approach specific to chuditch. Concurrent DNA sampling will improve an understanding of the genetic structure across the entire species range. The information gained will help to inform decisions both in relation to the effective conservation management of chuditch, as well as sourcing animals for translocations to ensure newly established populations are genetically diverse and representative of the species.</p>

                                    <p>Operation Rangelands Restoration commenced in 2000 with the acquisition of Lorna Glen (Matuwa) and&nbsp;Earaheedy (Kurrara Kurrara) ex-pastoral leases by the WA Government, that were made a National Park in 2023. We are working in collaboration with&nbsp;the traditional owners, Tarlka Matuwa Piarku Aboriginal Corporation, who were granted exclusive&nbsp;native title over the area in 2014, to restore ecosystem function and biodiversity in the rangelands. Matuwa&nbsp;once supported many mammal species, that have suffered large declines. This project seeks to reintroduce 11&nbsp;arid zone mammal species following the successful suppression of feral cats and foxes. Mammal reconstruction&nbsp;will also contribute to the restoration of rangeland ecosystems through re-establishment of ecosystem services&nbsp;such as digging, grazing/browsing of vegetation and seed dispersal.&nbsp;The first mammal reintroductions commenced in August 2007 with the release of bilby (<em>Macrotis lagotis</em>) and&nbsp;brushtail possums (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>). Between 2010-2012, mala (<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>), Shark Bay mice&nbsp;(<em>Pseudomys fieldi</em>), boodies (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) and golden bandicoots (<em>Isoodon auratus</em>) were translocated&nbsp;into a 1100 hectare introduced predator-free fenced enclosure. The enclosure is intended to provide species&nbsp;with an opportunity to acclimatise to the desert environment. The ultimate goal is to release animals outside the&nbsp;enclosure and establish free-ranging, self sustaining populations of these species.</p>

                            Applied research undertaken by the Ecosystem Science Program seeks to understand the environmental, ecological and biogeographical processes that determine the conservation values, health and productivity of the lands and inland waters managed by the department. The program's research spans two broad themes: biogeography, and how ecosystems function and respond to threatening processes and management.Biological surveys provide information on the composition of communities and distribution of the State's flora and fauna at scales relevant to management questions. Survey data provide the foundation for a range of management activities, including conservation estate planning, assessing the conservation status of species and communities and predicting the impacts of other land uses and threats.The program investigates how ecosystems function and respond to water and land resource management practices and to broadscale threats including salinity, altered hydrology, climate change and habitat fragmentation. Projects include investigations into the nature of threats and monitoring associated ecological responses and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The program also investigates genetic diversity, evolutionary history and ecological plasticity of plant populations to guide seed collection for restoration.The program collaborates with other parts of the department, museums and herbaria, universities, cooperative research centres, natural resource management groups, CSIRO and other research providers. Partnerships also exist with traditional owners, resource companies and the environmental consulting industry.

<li>Comparative analysis of two small <em>Acacia</em> shrubs with patchy distributions, <em>Acacia hilliana</em> and <em>A. spondylophylla, </em>show genetic differentiation among populations indicating some restrictions to gene flow in contrast to the widespread gene flow in the tree species. These results have been published in the journal <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>.</li>

<li>Analysis of two widespread shrubs,&nbsp;<em>Petalostylis labicheoides</em> and <em>Indigofera monophylla,</em>&nbsp;showed higher genetic diversity in <em>I. monophylla</em> than in <em>P. labicheoides</em>, and slightly higher diversity was located in the Hamersley Ranges for both species. A divergent lineage of <em>P. labicheoides</em> was detected in the northeast Pilbara, and some structure in <em>I. monophylla</em> indicated higher levels of range-wide differentiation in these shrubs compared to widespread trees. This comparative analysis has been published in the journal <em>Annals of Botany</em>.</li>
<li>Analysis of genetic diversity in <em>Senna glutinosa</em> subsp. <em>glutinosa </em>found very high levels of clonality within populations, and further analysis of seedlings revealed many of them to have identical genotypes as their mother plant, confirming apomixis as the dominant reproductive strategy, although some sexual reproduction was evident. Apomictic clones were distributed across the Pilbara landscape with no particular geographic pattern. This evidence of long-distance seed dispersal is likely driven by water movement following cyclonic activity. A manuscript is under review in the <em>Journal of Biogeography</em>.</li>

<li>Understanding patterns of genetic diversity provides information for seed collection strategies in restoration and revegetation. Analysis of a range of species in the Pilbara provides information to support effective mine site restoration.</li>
<li>While one tree species, <em>Eucalyptus leucophloia</em>, showed a pattern of ranges in the Pilbara being refugia, other species have not. The low level of differentiation in other tree species and large shrubs, such as&nbsp;<em>Corymbia hamersleyana,&nbsp;</em><em>Acacia</em> <em>pruinocarpa</em>,&nbsp;<em>I. monophylla and S. glutinosa </em>subsp<em>. glutinosa&nbsp;</em>imply that seed resources for land rehabilitation and mine site revegetation programs for these species can be selected from a wide distributional range within the Pilbara.

<li>High genetic differentiation within species such as&nbsp;<em>A. hilliana</em>, <em>A. spondylophylla and</em>&nbsp;<em>M. viminalis </em>that have&nbsp;more restricted and patchy distributions indicate more limited seed collection zones are appropriate.&nbsp;</li>

                                    <p>Biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of ecological processes that include balances and fluxes of water, energy and biogeochemistry.

<li>Continued monitoring of groundwater levels, streamflow, stream salinity, stream turbidity, rainfall, an automatic weather station and sap flow in Yarragil 4L, 4X,&nbsp;6C,&nbsp;and Wuraming&nbsp;catchments in the Perth Hills District, 20km south of Dwellingup. This monitoring will indicate how thinning and the slow adjustment of the forest and hydrology in the decade or so post-thinning alters groundwater recharge and streamflow generation, informing riparian zone conservation, estimates of water demand by healthy thinned and unthinned forest.</li>
<li>Monitoring of sap flow paused at Yarragil 4X and 4L with an upgrade of the data logger software and will recommence in July 2023. Sap flow provides a direct measure of tree water use, and a comparison of water use by similar sized trees with similar depths to groundwater at these sites provides an improved understanding of how thinning can mitigate water stress and improve forest health.</li>
<li>A total of 2.4km of electrical resistivity geophysics surveys were conducted at Yarragil 4X and 4L which enabled imaging of soil depth and depth to bedrock in parts of these catchments. This data will be used in the future development of ecohydrological models of the catchments. These models can then be used to improve predictions of the effects of thinning on the hydrological response.</li>
<li>Soil and stem samples were retrieved from Yarragil 4x (unthinned) and 4L (thinned 2019) and submitted for water stable isotope analyses. This sampling will continue through to the summer of 2023-24. This information, together with sap flow, will help inform how tree water use changes in response to thinning.&nbsp;</li>

As a fundamental data platform, Lifeplan will generate standardised, global data on a range of species groups, allowing quantification of variation in ecological communities at spatial scales from 0.1 km to 10000 km across hundreds of thousands of species. This project is establishing 100 sites globally, with additional denser sampling in the Nordic countries and in Madagascar. Each of the 100+ global sites will consist of paired urban and natural locations. Perth has been selected as one of the global sites, with plots located in woodlands dominated by <em>Banksia</em> and <em>Casuarina</em> in Lowlands Nature Reserve and Kings Park. In addition to investigating global patterns in biodiversity, the project aims to scale up the use of efficient biodiversity monitoring tools (machine learning analysis of ecoacoustics and camera trapping data, and metabarcoding of aerial spores, soil fungi and flying insects). The project will be carried out over six years, with sampling alternating between the Lowlands and Kings Park locations.</p>

<li>Thinning concentrates the growth potential of a site onto selected trees and provides forest managers with options to manage stands for particular structural characteristics that may be important for wildlife habitat or resilience to disturbance. Thinning is an important tool for managing streamflow and groundwater levels in forested catchments in the face of a drying climate as well as maximizing growth of retained trees.&nbsp; The current study indicates that stand basal area growth in even aged stands was optimised at retained basal ares of 13m<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>ha<sup>-1</sup>.</li>

<li>Vehicle based spotlight monitoring of mammals on three standardised transects was conducted in Autumn (3 repeat surveys per transect). These surveys occurred immediately after a gum leaf skeletoniser outbreak that impacted approximately 100,000ha of the Upper Warren region during the summer. In some areas the outbreak has resulted in almost complete defoliation of all jarrah trees, a key source of food for ngwayir (western ringtail possum), in particular. The impacted area, includes the areas surrounding the three long-term monitoring transects in Greater Kingston. While no substantial declines were observed in the detection rates of the critically endangered ngwayir or koomal (brushtail possum) it is possible that significant declines may be observed in the coming year.</li>
<li>A pedestrian-based spotlight survey within the Perup Sanctuary was conducted in November 2022 resulted in population estimates of 156 ngwayir individuals (95% Confidence Interval 127&ndash;192) and 350 koomal individuals (95% CI 272 &ndash; 452) within the 423 hectare predator-free sanctuary. Densities of both species did not differ between areas subject to prescribed burning 5 and 22 years ago. Competition from koomal may be limiting the distribution and abundance of ngwayir. </li>

Over half of the species are not formally described, but they are consistently named across departmental projects through maintenance of a voucher specimen collection. As opportunities and skills allow, program staff undertake systematics studies (primarily species descriptions and genetic analyses), sometimes with specialist co-authors. This allows formal naming and description of Western Australian endemics that would not otherwise occur and allows species to be consistently identified by external research groups.

                                    <p>Taxonomic knowledge underpins effective management of aquatic invertebrate biodiversity, including spatial patterning and trends over time in relation to threats. Over half of the species are not formally described, but they are consistently named across departmental projects through maintenance of a voucher specimen collection. As opportunities and skills allow, program staff undertake systematics studies (primarily species descriptions and genetic analyses), sometimes with specialist co-authors. This allows formal naming and description of Western Australian endemics that would not otherwise occur and allows species to be consistently identified by external research groups. Tools allowing consistent identification of aquatic invertebrates will also be produced.</p>

                            The Fire Science Program seeks to inform fire management and biodiversity conservation on lands managed by the department, including state forests, national parks and other conservation reserves. The strategic goal of the program is to ensure that the best available scientific information is used for integrated fire management to protect communities and natural values. Key themes for the program include developing and validating decision support tools for fire management, and understanding the effects of fire regimes on species, ecosystems and landscapes and how these interact with threatening processes including weeds, introduced predators and climate change. Monitoring and learning from the outcomes of prescribed burns and bushfire incidents is also an important activity for the program. Strong collaborative linkages exist with universities, cooperative research centres, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, other government agencies and private sector research providers.

                                    <p>The Great Western Woodlands (GWW) is an internationally significant area with great biological and cultural richness. This 16 million hectare region of south-western Australia contains the world's largest and most intact area of contiguous temperate woodland. The GWW Conservation Strategy and a review conducted by a wide range of scientific experts identified inappropriate fire regimes as a threat to the woodlands and emphasised the need for a science-based fire management regime for the area. Critical gaps in the knowledge of fire ecology for GWW ecosystems are a hindrance to ecological fire management in the region. The GWW supports eucalypt woodlands at very low mean annual rainfall (250-350 mm). Many of the woodland eucalypt species are killed by fire (obligate-seeders), and eucalypt recruitment is stimulated by fire but individuals are slow growing. In recent decades a large part of the GWW has been burnt and concern has been expressed over the ecological impacts of this. Fire ecology research already undertaken in eastern Wheatbelt nature reserves will help resolve ecological fire management issues for mallee and mallee-heath communities in the GWW but similar information for the dominant eucalypt woodlands is needed.</p>

<li>Analysed combined on-ground vegetation structure measurements of tree allometry with high-resolution remotely piloted aircraft and medium-resolution airborne LiDAR and coarse-resolution GEDI satellite LiDAR covering the whole region. This analysis demonstrated that woodland age classes can be reliably distinguished based on their 3D canopy structure and supported identification of vegetation structural features that scale robustly across platforms for development of a spatial model of woodland age class across the whole GWW. A paper on this work has been submitted for publication.</li>
<li>Vegetation structure and biomass data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence was used to calculate changes in woodland carbon stocks with time since fire, in collaboration with CSIRO Environment and supported by Woodside Energy.</li>
<li>Juvenile period data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence formed part of&nbsp;a south-western Australia-wide analysis showing that juvenile period in slow-maturing serotinous obligate seeders can be predicted from climate and site productivity, allowing the development of models of juvenile period over space and time under both recent environmental conditions and those projected to occur in the future. The spatial data from this work have been made available through the Corporate Data Delivery Program and DataWA, and a BCS Information Sheet was produced to inform on-ground fire management.</li>
<li>Plant trait data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence underpinned staff involvement in national seed and dispersal trait and fire response and regeneration trait workshops hosted by the AusTraits collaboration.

<li>National-scale syntheses of temperate eucalypt woodland responses to disturbance revealed that many Western Australian woodlands are uniquely dominated by taxa that are obligate seeding, and have vegetation dynamics driven by rare, stand-replacing disturbances. These characteristics illustrate a putative vulnerability to decreases in intervals between fires, and large changes in vegetation composition, structure and carbon stocks with time since fire and with variation in prior fire interval. This information contributes to understanding ecological and functional responses to fire.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Post-fire succession in vegetation composition and structure, which in turn determines successional patterns in animals, occurs over multi-century timescales, demonstrating the value of avoiding fire in mature woodlands to maximise future fire management options.</li>
<li>Development of spatial and temporal models of juvenile period in slow-maturing serotinous obligate seeders across south-western Australia allows identification of where: (i) historic fire intervals may have led to immaturity risk impacts, assisting in delineation of areas and taxa for which targeted conservation interventions may be most valuable; and (ii) the risks of climate change-driven decreases in fire intervals are greatest and where fire management to support persistence of fire refugia is most important.</li>
<li>A spatial map of multi-century GWW woodland age classes provides the basis for departmental, Department of Fire and Emergency Services and Ngadju Conservation Aboriginal Corporation fire managers to plan fire mitigation and suppression activities to minimise loss of mature woodlands in bushfires.</li>

                                    <p>This project is a biodiversity monitoring and evaluation program to inform adaptive management of fire and cattle in the north Kimberley. The adaptive management program that forms the Landscape Conservation Initiative (LCI) of the <em>Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy</em> commenced in 2011 in response to perceived threats by cattle and fire to biodiversity conservation in the North Kimberley. This initiative is based on the hypothesis that large numbers of introduced herbivores and the impacts of current fire regimes are associated with declines of critical weight range mammals, contraction and degradation of rainforest patches, and degradation of vegetation structure and habitat condition in savannas. This monitoring and evaluation program will provide a report card on performance of landscape management initiatives in the north Kimberley, particularly prescribed burning and cattle culling, in maintaining and improving biodiversity status.</p>

<li>Compare biodiversity outcomes in intensively managed and unmanaged areas to evaluate the effectiveness of management interventions in maintaining and improving conservation values.</li>
<li>Investigate cane toad and predator interactions&nbsp;that&nbsp;may influence mammal abundance.</li>

<li>Trapping at Mt Hart, Wunaamin Miliwundi National Park, Mt Trafalgar and Prince Regent National Park, shows that northern quolls persist following cane toad invasion. Individuals were captured in both locations following years where none were captured.</li>
<li>Increasing the areas of longer unburnt vegetation using patch mosaic burning has contributed to re-establishment of <em>Rattus tunneyi</em> populations in the Mt Trafalgar area. This species disappeared after extensive fires in 2016, but was re-trapped in 2023 monitoring. This result vindicates ongoing evidence-based development of the Kimberley fire management program.</li>
<li>Monitoring continues to inform on threatened mammal fire responses, showing that some species, including golden-backed tree-rats and other rodents, may have peak abundance at 4-6 years post fire, followed by population decline.</li>
<li>Analysis of vegetation change under a decade of fire management indicates savanna structural stability under adaptive management and climate change.</li>
<li>An experiment assessing the potential synergies among fire and weed management for invasive annual grader grass (<em>Themeda quadrivalvis</em>) was established in Wunaamin Conservation Reserve with prefire plant community composition and cover assessed both prior to and after treatment. Treatments involved combinations of fire and either no herbicide or one of two herbicide treatments. Sites were assessed in collaboration with East Kimberley District officers and Bunuba Rangers.</li>

                                    <ul>
<li>Analysis of the monitoring data shows that increasing patchy early dry season prescribed burning benefits most threatened species.</li>
<li>The fire mosaic attribute most closely aligned with high diversity and abundance of threatened mammals is percentage of long unburnt vegetation. This indicates that long unburnt patches are an important target for prescribed burning in the region.</li>
<li>There is now strong evidence that cattle have a negative influence on threatened mammals such as the brush-tailed rabbit rat.&nbsp;This supports continuation of the department's feral cattle culling program for the benefit of threatened mammals and the other groups threatened by cattle.</li>
<li>Feral cats are strongly negatively associated with threatened mammal abundance and richness. In this context, it is important to maintain vegetation cover through fire and cattle management to reduce cat hunting effectiveness.</li>

                            The broad goal of the Marine Science Program is to ensure the department's marine biodiversity conservation and management programs are based on best practice science. Specifically, the program promotes and undertakes marine research and monitoring to improve the scientific basis for the conservation and management of Western Australia's State-wide system of marine protected areas, threatened marine fauna and marine biodiversity generally. The program also coordinates and manages external marine research programs, such as the current investigation into the bio-physical, social and cultural values of the Kimberley that is undertaken as part of the Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI). The research and monitoring programs undertaken by the Marine Science Program are based around the research and monitoring strategies identified in protected area management plans and threatened species recovery and management plans, ensuring that all activities are linked to departmental priorities and programs.

<li>The flatback turtles foraging project at Roebuck Bay provides insight into biology and ecology of resident flatbacks and provides access to turtles for health studies. It has provided a spatial context to habitat use that can be used by joint managers (DBCA and Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation) to assess how other activities in the bay such as pearling, shipping and recreational boating overlap with flatback turtles.</li>
<li>Culling foxes at Mundabullanagana Station contributes to protection of turtles by directly mitigating mortality of eggs and hatchlings.</li>
<li>Partnerships with Pilbara and Kimberley Indigenous groups enhance the long-term benefits of the program by providing a cultural perspective and relevance to the work; positive communication of the program throughout the communities, stability in governance and advice pathways, and a way of transferring information.</li>

                                    <p>Primary productivity provides energy that fuels food webs and is recognised as an important driver of local diversity and secondary production. Hence conservation planning often aims to identify where primary production&nbsp;is high; what systems, including their spatial arrangement, are most productive and how efficiently productivity&nbsp;from these producers is transferred to other systems or consumers. While marine productivity is largely&nbsp;attributable to oceanic phytoplankton, productivity from benthic macrophytes becomes&nbsp;increasingly important in coastal food webs. However, the link between&nbsp;benthic productivity by vascular plants and algae and secondary production remains equivocal.

<li>Identification of locations of high productivity may be used in spatial planning within the Dampier Archipelago and improve scientific advice relating to development projects in the area. Results will be transferable to planning in other locations with similar environmental conditions, by assessing which environmental factors correlate with high productivity.</li>
<li>The lower turf algal productivity in Dampier Archipelago compared to other tropical coral reefs indicates lower herbivorous fish productivity. This is likely driven by turbidity, which may be natural or due to local coastal development in the Dampier Archipelago. Management should consider the impacts of future coastal development that may increase turbidity beyond natural variation along WA coastlines.</li>
<li>As nearshore coral reefs experience greater turbidity&nbsp;with intensifying climate change and anthropogenic development, the knowledge that some scleractinian corals can alter their feeding strategies in response to&nbsp;turbidity levels, will allow for improved environmental impact assessment and&nbsp;predictive modelling for future coral reef conservation.</li>
<li>Local habitat complexity was the strongest predictor of fish abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition in both coral and macroalgal habitats and this supports management approaches that prioritise the preservation of habitat complexity and incorporate the full range of habitats present in tropical seascapes.</li>

                                    <p>Macroalgae are a prominent component of tropical benthic communities along the north-west coast of Australia. Within Ningaloo Marine Park, large fields of macroalgae are a distinct feature of the lagoon, covering approximately 2000 hectares. These macroalgal fields are important habitats for fish targeted by recreational fishers and are a focal area for boating activity within the park. Moreover, large seasonal shifts in algal biomass on these and other tropical reefs suggest macroalgae play an important role in nutrient fluxes in Ningaloo and similar systems. Recent work at Ningaloo has quantitatively assessed seasonal variation in biomass and diversity of macroalgal communities. This project will build on the information gained from these initial studies to improve understanding of how macroalgae are distributed across the Ningaloo lagoon and better define the role of macroalgal fields as habitat for fish recruits and adults.</p>

<li>Macroalgal data collected contributed to an Indo-Pacific examination of the broadscale effects of human disturbance on macroalgal cover on coral reefs. The study found that generalisations about total algal cover are ineffective and that finer scale genus level data is required to fully understand ecosystem impacts. A paper was published in <em>Global Change Biology.</em></li>
<li>Data from fish surveys over the past 11 years were used to examine if abundance of recruit and juvenile fish can predict abundance of adult spangled and yellow tail emperor. Modelling indicates that juveniles reliably forecast abundance of fish 1-2 years of age, but not older fish. A full draft of the paper has now progressed for submission.</li>

<li>Tropical macroalgal habitats are important nurseries for fish of ecological and fisheries importance in Ningaloo Marine Park. Canopy forming macroalgal fields are therefore, habitats of high conservation value that should be considered for protection when planning marine reserves.</li>

<li>Understanding how climatic processes affect both the supply of juveniles and quality of nursery habitat improves our understanding of temporal fluctuations in fish abundance and ability to predict future populations.</li>
<li>Improving the capacity to predict future abundances of adult fishes, particularly those threatened by changes to habitat, climate and fishing pressure, will help to maintain important social values like recreational fishing.</li>

                                    <p>Seagrasses are foundation species that support important ecosystem services and processes worldwide. Seagrass meadows are declining globally and anthropogenic pressures such as terrestrial run-off, anchor damage and dredging threaten the ecological, economic and social services that seagrass meadows provide. Some of the world's largest and most diverse seagrass meadows occur in Western Australia and support many commercially, recreationally and culturally important fauna. As the condition of seagrass meadows respond readily to pressures, they are used as indicators for the overall effectiveness of management across marine reserves managed by the department. Across-region comparisons and thorough temporal assessments of seagrass condition will provide a broader appreciation of seagrass health among the State&rsquo;s network of marine reserves. Furthermore, a greater understanding of how the climate change related pressures of increased seawater temperature and extreme events impact seagrass meadows and the ecosystem services they provide, is needed. This is particularly the case in vulnerable regions like Shark Bay, where the full extent of seagrass loss since the 2010-11 marine heatwave in Western Australia&rsquo;s largest World Heritage Area was, until recently, not well understood.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Animals' survival depends on good and timely solutions to the problems being experienced. Sometimes problems are widely spaced in time so a problem solving strategy that is not retained in their memory does not provide a substantial cognitive economy to the individual. Among terrestrial mammals, elephants, along with humans and great apes, have large brains, are long-lived and have offspring that require long periods of dependency. Studying the memory of an Asian elephant may allow greater insights into the evolution of cognitive abilities in large brained animals.</p>

                                    <p>Animals' survival depends on good and timely solutions to the problems being experienced. Sometimes problems are widely spaced in time so a problem solving strategy that is not retained in their memory does not provide a substantial cognitive economy to the individual. Among terrestrial mammals, elephants, along with humans and great apes, have large brains, are long-lived and have offspring that require long periods of dependency. Studying the memory of an Asian elephant may allow greater insights into the evolution of cognitive abilities in large brained animals.</p>

                            Applied flora conservation research seeks to understand the factors and processes that are critical for the conservation of Western Australia's native plant diversity. Major objectives include ensuring the persistence of rare and threatened species, understanding key threats such as Phytophthora dieback and weeds, and improving the understanding of genetic and ecological factors that are vital for the long-term viability of plant species. Strong collaborative linkages exist with universities, cooperative research centres, CSIRO, other research providers such as the National Environmental Science Program and the corporate sector.The program includes the Western Australian Herbarium that houses the State collection of scientific specimens of plants, algae and fungi. Information in the collection underpins the conservation of Western Australian flora. The Herbarium is responsible for: documenting and understanding the diversity of Western Australia's plants, algae and fungi; maintaining a research and archive collection of specimens of all species in these groups from throughout their range in Western Australia; helping the community, industry and researchers understand and identify plants, algae and fungi; contributing to, supporting and servicing the research, conservation and decision-making activities of  government; contributing to taxonomic research by the Australian and the international scientific community; providing authoritative information to government, industry and the community via the FloraBase website and the Herbarium's information management systems.

<li>Determine the genetic relationship between the disjunct populations of three species (<em>Daviesia obovata, Gastrolobium crenulatum </em>and&nbsp;<em>Andersonia echinocephala</em>)&nbsp;that occur exclusively in the Stirling Ranges&nbsp; and Fitzgerald River National Parks.</li>
<li>Determine the genetic relationships among several subspecies and unnamed entities within <em>Conospermum caeruleum</em>.</li>
<li>Determine the genetic relationships within four species complexes (<em>Geleznowia</em>, <em>Isopogon</em>, <em>Synaphea</em> and <em>Wurmbea</em>) as part of the Genomes of Australian Plants (GAP) initiative.</li>
<li>Assess the taxonomic status of <em>Rhagodia</em> sp. Hamersley (M. Trudgen 17794) in relation to <em>R</em>. <em>eremaea</em> in the Pilbara.</li>
<li>Determine the genetic relationships among several subspecies and species in the <em>Grevillea brachystylis</em> complex.</li>

<li>A taxonomic revision of Western Australian species of <em>Leptospermum</em> based on the genomics results has been published in <em>Nuytsia</em>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Genomic analysis of the&nbsp;<em>C. caeruleum</em>&nbsp;species complex is complete, showing that at least three distinct species should be recognised, with three management units within one of those species. A paper has been published in <em>Biodiversity and Conservation</em>.</li>
<li>Genomic analysis of the nine species of the gimlet complex is almost complete and a manuscript is in preparation.</li>
<li>Genomic analysis and morphological assessment of <em>V. spicata</em> has shown that there is a lack of evidence to support the continued recognition of <em>V. spicata</em> subsp. <em>squamosa</em> as a subspecies distinct from <em>V. spicata</em> subsp. <em>spicata</em>. A manuscript is near completion.</li>
<li>Genomic analysis of&nbsp;<em>D. obovata</em>&nbsp;is complete, showing that the populations within each national park are highly divergent from one another and that the populations within each national park are quite distinct. DNA extractions are underway for the remaining two species.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Genomic analysis is largely complete for the four species complexes in the GAP project. Two of the studies are almost finished (<em>Geleznowia</em> and <em>Isopogon</em>) and manuscripts have been submitted for publication. Morphological analysis of<em> Wurmbea</em> is underway, and further analysis of&nbsp;<em>Synaphea</em> is being undertaken given complexities around clonality.</li>
<li>Field sampling and sequencing for the&nbsp;<em>G. brachystylis </em> group is complete and data analysis is progressing.&nbsp;</li>

<li>A study to assess mating system variation and genetic diversity for two translocated <em>Banksia&nbsp;brownii</em> populations and benchmark these measures against seven&nbsp;natural populations has been completed. In addition, a pollination study on a subset of four of the natural and one of the translocated populations of <em>Banksia brownii</em> to assess the adequacy of pollination in the translocated population, has also been completed. Key findings were the use of multiple source populations for translocation resulted in higher reproductive output and equivalent levels of genetic diversity compared to reference wild populations. However, the translocated population had the highest rates of selfing, which could potentially lead to the long-term erosion of genetic diversity through unfavourable patterns of mating. The results of these studies have been published in the <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>.</li>
<li>Assessment of fitness traits is ongoing in a common garden experiment involving 1100 seedlings of <em>Banksia brownii</em> from montane and lowland natural populations and a translocated population, to examine trait differences between montane and lowland populations, and implications for population mixing, and to benchmark the performance of the translocated population. Initial findings have shown that outcrossed seedlings have higher fitness than self-pollinated seedlings and management of the translocated populations should focus on ways to improve pollinator services to improve long-term translocation success. Two manuscripts have been prepared from this work. One is in draft and the second is in review for publication in <em>Restoration Ecology</em>.</li>
<li>Data analysis has been completed on genetic diversity data for natural and translocated populations of <em>Acacia cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em> and <em>A. cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>velutinosa</em>. This study will benchmark genetic diversity in translocated and natural populations of <em>A. cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em> and assess genetic structure across the range of both subspecies. Key results include levels of genetic diversity in two translocated populations are equivalent to the single wild source population and two other wild populations, indicating the use of the single seed source for the translocation was appropriate. Patterns of genetic structure across the two subspecies generally indicate significant differentiation between them. An exception was a population of <em>A. cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em> near Dowerin that showed less differentiation from the subsp. <em>velutinosa</em> whilst fitting the morphological description of subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em>. A manuscript describing this study is in preparation.</li>
<li>Analysis of genotyping and mating system data has been completed for <em>Banksia anatona,</em>&nbsp;to assess mating system performance and genetic diversity in a translocated population compared to natural populations. Results showed genetic diversity of two translocated populations were equivalent to three wild source populations and the mating system estimates for one translocated population (second translocation not assessed) largely reflected those of wild populations. The species showed a predominantly outcrossing mating system. A manuscript describing this study is near completion.</li>
<li>Genetic and taxonomic revision of subspecies within <em>Lambertia orbifolia</em> has been completed. This work used earlier genetic analysis of <em>Lambertia orbifolia</em> and combined this with a genetic study of a recently discovered population and measures of herbarium specimens to formally describe three subspecies. This taxonomic revision was published in <em>Nuytsia</em>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Genomic analysis of two species, <em>Banksia cuneata</em> and <em>Chorizema humile</em>, is currently underway to assess genetic diversity and population differentiation across extant populations, both natural and translocated, as well as to assess the genetic diversity of seed collections currently stored in the Western Australian Seed Centre.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Genomic analysis of <em>Tetratheca butcheriana</em> is currently underway to assess fine scale patterns of genetic diversity and population differentiation across its very narrow range in the Pilbara.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Clarifying the taxonomy and identification of <em>Ptilotus</em>, <em>Gomphrena, Eremophila</em> and <em>Swainsona</em> is important as these genera include indicator species and are significant for rangeland and arid land management and assessment. Many species are annuals and <em>Swainsona</em> is a nitrogen-fixing legume. Some species of <em>Ptilotus</em> have been shown to have high phosphate uptake capabilities and are potentially useful in land restoration and rehabilitation programs. Several species within each genus are listed as threatened flora or are on the priority flora list. Having a sound taxonomic understanding of the species within these genera will enable the department to provide informed advice on the conservation status of the species and the communities they inhabit and how best they can be managed.</p>

It is continually updated to reflect changes in our knowledge of the flora. The census constitutes the fundamental master list for many departmental processes and data sets, including the threatened and priority flora database maintained by the Species and Communities Program, the Herbarium's specimen database (WAHerb), Max (the departmental software for information based on taxonomic names), <em>Florabase</em> and <em>Dandjoo </em>(Biodiversity Information Office).</p>
<p>The Australian Plant Census (APC) is a Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria project, part of the National Species List infrastructure, designed to provide a consensus view of all Australian plant taxa. The APC delivers authoritative information on what species occur in Australia as a whole to obtain accurate national statistics and resolve differences in opinion and knowledge for taxa that cross State boundaries. In addition to working systematically through the vascular plant families, the APC process provides for updates as taxonomic changes or new findings are formally published. The consensus also extends from family and genus level to an overall classification of the plants that occur in Australia. The Western Australian Plant Census is updated to reflect the consensus view, produced annually. The APC provides the key name list for the Atlas of Living Australia and the Australasian Virtual Herbarium.</p>

Numerous phrase-named taxa in the genus<em> Baeckea</em> were formally published under<em> Austrobaeckea</em> and<em> Balaustion&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;(30 species; 500 collection items), and a significant revision of Phyllanthaceae resulted in the transfer of&nbsp;<em>Phyllanthus</em>&nbsp;species to other genera (20 species; 1200 collection items).</span></li>
<li>WACensus updates were regularly distributed to 170 registered Max users.</li>
<li>More than 1700 archived census forms, including descriptions of phrase name taxa, were scanned by volunteers and are now electronically available for internal use.</li>

<li>Studies of the effects of fire interval, <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback, browsing and threat mitigation actions on population trends for 26 threatened and Priority flora in the Stirling Range National Park provided critical information on impacts of 2018 and 2019 fires and priorities for species recovery through <em>in situ </em>threat management and translocation.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Demographic studies and experiments investigating the impact of disease, fire intervals and patchiness, and environmental weeds on threatened flora will provide critical information for supporting species recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Spatial analysis of threatened and Priority flora and threats identified ancient, infertile uplands and surface geologies of limited extent within 300-500 km of the present-day coast as hotspots for flora conservation and management. Flora on these geologies have higher frequencies of traits that elevate their susceptibility to extremes in fire interval and <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback. Differences in patterns of spatial distribution of data-deficient and threatened flora suggest that conservation activities directed at mitigating threats to natural populations of threatened flora will not be effective for the conservation management of a significant proportion of the data-deficient flora. This finding emphasises the value of threat mitigation actions in locations supporting numerous data-deficient flora.</li>

                            The Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis Program seeks to integrate the science and application of remote sensing and spatial analysis into departmental programs. For a department that manages large tracts of terrestrial and marine conservation parks and reserves, the efficient use and analysis of spatial data is crucial for understanding natural processes and informing management actions.In recent times the availability of spatial data has increased dramatically. With this increase in data, the Program is continuing to develop sophisticated statistical analysis, interpretative and automation techniques to synthesise data into a form where they directly assist departmental staff.The program undertakes fire mapping over extensive areas of the State. Utilising time series satellite imagery and ground information,  monitoring programs have been established in the forest, wetland, marine, coastal, rangeland and tropical savanna environments. Species and habitat modelling and spatially explicit assessments, such as risk assessments, allow managers to identify areas of concern and efficiently utilise resources. Program scientists collaborate with other parts of the department, universities, CSIRO, natural resource management groups, resource companies and other research providers.

However, while the extent of degradation is widely acknowledged, it is not known whether these ecosystems have the ecological capacity to naturally recover when agricultural grazing pressures are removed or how resilient they might be to future climatic extremes.</p>

                                    <p>The spatial analysis and modelling project develops and utilises tools to assist in the evaluation, interpretation and prediction of conservation values, threatening processes and management actions. These tools generally integrate spatial data sets, expert knowledge and GIS modelling techniques to produce spatially explicit products that can be used to inform decision making. Projects can be focused on species occurrence (species distribution models or habitat suitability modelling), animal movement (for example, identification of home range or habitat linkages), landscape scale processes (including assessment of habitat fragmentation) or assessments such as quantifying risk (for example risk presented by feral cattle to biodiversity values). Identification of areas of high conservation value for protection is also undertaken by combining numerous conservation value data sets and using software to evaluate possible conservation scenarios.&nbsp;</p>

This information is particularly important in relation to recreationally targeted fish species that have high value in the Perth community.</p>
<p>Acoustic technology can be utilised to provide valuable information on fish movements relative to water quality parameters, such as salinity and dissolved oxygen, and to major interventions within the river system, such as the Swan Canning Oxygenation Program and the Kent Street Weir fishway. Acoustic technology can also be employed to understand how fish utilise habitats of differing complexity, particularly those that are not suited to traditional sampling methods. An acoustic array in the Swan Canning was established in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>How fish utilise the Swan Canning Estuary, including distances moved on a daily or seasonal basis and movements in response to changes in environmental condition, remains a key knowledge gap despite a number of detailed studies on fish biology and ecology over the past three decades. This information is particularly important in relation to recreationally targeted fish species that have high value in the Perth community.</p>
<p>Acoustic technology can be utilised to provide valuable information on fish movements relative to water quality parameters, such as salinity and dissolved oxygen, and to major interventions within the river system, such as the Swan Canning Oxygenation Program and the Kent Street Weir fishway. Acoustic technology can also be employed to understand how fish utilise habitats of differing complexity, particularly those that are not suited to traditional sampling methods. An acoustic array in the Swan Canning was established in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<li>A report documenting the 2022 fish community index (FCI) results was completed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the 2022 season, the combined scores for offshore and nearshore sites were the best recorded over the last decade of monitoring. These were attributed to strong flows in the winter of 2021, which were the best in 25 years.</li>
<li>Scores in offshore waters of the Canning Estuary were poorer in comparison to other zones and this result continues an historic trend.</li>
<li>Further investigation of this trend identified that the low FCI scores were influenced by low number of species and diversity and a high proportion of detritivores in the offshore waters of the Canning. Low dissolved oxygen did not appear to be a factor driving these results.&nbsp;</li>

<li>The good overall FCI scores in 2022, and particularly in the Swan, were a function of strong winter flows and good water quality, including low densities of harmful algae and oxic conditions through summer and autumn. This provides for better understanding of environmental factors influencing fish communities in the system.</li>

                                    <p>Ocean sprawl is an increasing disturbance that is occurring along the Lower Swan-Canning Estuary (LSCE), replacing complex marine habitats with simplistic artificial structures, that can result in the decline of species richness and abundance. Using remote image collection methods (ROVs, drop-cameras, and tow-cameras) in conjunction with habitat classification systems, benthic surveys can be conducted across areas of importance to assist is assessing species abundance and extent of species reduction over time. As the LSCE is an important ecosystem for a range of species and habitats, as well as recreational users, collecting data to establish distribution maps of key habitats is essential to understand the influences of this system.&nbsp;</p>

<li>A six week stakeholder consultation process for TEC occurrences included notification to private landholders, mineral tenement holders,&nbsp;pastoral lease holders, government agencies, and&nbsp;Native Title holders and Indigenous Protected Area Body Corporates of TEC occurrences on their land.</li>
<li>The document <em>Methods for survey and identification of Western Australian threatened ecological communities</em> was published, providing further detailed information about floristic community types on the southern Swan Coastal Plain.</li>
<li>Detailed scientific and technical information was provided to the Commonwealth government to inform listing decisions under the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em>.</li>

                                <p>This project aims to assess the health and disease status of sea turtles in Western Australia, with a focus on flatback turtles. For stranded dead and injured turtles, pathology is used to diagnose the causes of death and injury, with parasite infections and fibropapilloma virus being specifically investigated. For healthy turtles the project has established a blood chemistry reference baseline which can be used nationally by turtle care facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outcomes of this project included the first health assessment of sea turtles in Western Australia, including blood chemistry and reference baselines for nesting and in-water flatback turtles. Processes for pathology and pathology descriptions for flatback turtles were developed and personnel across the state were trained. Knowledge transfer to stakeholders included support for the banning of mass balloon releases in WA. A novel disease related to a multiple species mortality event in Broome (fish kill) was identified, as were a new parasite and haemoparasites in flatback turtles. A paper has been published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Diseases of Aquatic Organisms</em>, three draft manuscripts are in preparation.</p>

                                <p>This research aimed to comprehensively test the influence of climatic and edaphic variation on the performance of genotypes from multiple provenances, to identify best-practice seed sourcing for restoration. Although many strategies for seed sourcing have been proposed, there are few empirical tests of different strategies. In this project, multiple genetic provenances of <em>Banksia menziesii</em>, a restoration priority plant species on the Swan Coastal Plain, were tested in post-mining rehabilitation field sites, as well as glasshouse growth trials where environmental parameters were modified. In addition, physical, chemical and biological properties of soils from these multiple source sites were assessed and compared to the performance of seeds sourced from these sites.</p>
<p>The project is complete and key findings included glasshouse studies that showed seedlings sourced from wetter regions showed higher growth and mortality when exposed to drought, whereas plants from drier seed sources had lower growth and did not show mortality when exposed to drought. Soil microbiome community and physicochemical analyses from remnant populations of <em>Banksia menziesii</em> across its range showed significant correlations between soil microbiome, soil physicochemical and climate distances. Results of a field trial identified that seed from drier provenances did not show superiority under initial field conditions. All results have been interpreted to better inform seed sourcing strategies under changing environmental conditions.</p>

                                <p>Globally, harmful algal blooms represent a major and growing threat due to their undesirable ecological, economic and health impacts. Since 2019 the Swan Canning has suffered repeated blooms of&nbsp;<em>Alexandrium, a</em> species that produces toxins can cause potentially fatal Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) in humans via consumption of impacted seafood. This project investigates the toxicity and genetics of local <em>Alexandrium</em> while also investigating a potential control method. Risk of exposure to toxins when eating crabs will be investigated by measuring toxin mobility when crabs are cooked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigations into control methods have found that Kaolinite clay with poly-alum chloride additive has superior control potential over bentonite clay. A manuscript reporting the results of this investigation is being finalised. A preliminary trial of crab intoxication and cook-test is currently underway. Protocols for toxin characterisation have been finalised and analysis of cultured strains is on-going.</p>

                                <p>Ecosystem resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to return to its former state following a disturbance, and is a key factor in evaluating the success of ecological restoration efforts. Resilience is difficult to measure and is unknown for many restored communities. This project investigates the resilience of banksia woodlands restored after sand mining to fire, specifically seeking to determine an age when restoration is resilient to fire. Investigations will assess resprouting capacity and soil seedbank dynamics across a chronosequence of ages between three and 27 years since restoration.</p>
<p>Experimental fire has been introduced to sites across the chronosquence and post-fire regeneration monitored for 1.5 years. Regeneration from soil seedbanks and resprouting was observed, with factors including size, restoration age and soil compaction influencing resprouting success. There is evidence of sites returning to a similar pre-fire state following fire, with some differences in perennial vegetation composition remaining between restored and intact sites.</p>

                                <p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is endemic to south-west Australia and occupies seasonal wetlands where hydroperiods are shortening due to declining rainfall. Trial assisted colonisation translocations 300-400 kilometres south of their current habitat began in 2016 to test whether <em>P. umbrina</em> can grow in cooler climates where hydroperiods are likely to be more suitable in the future. Early results indicated suitable food availability as a key component. The aims are to 1) develop novel environmental DNA methods to understand diet in new habitats; 2) document foraging behaviour in relation to water temperatures and prey availability; 3) link metabolic processes and food intake to predict long-term growth rates and reproduction in new environments. This will provide greater certainty on whether southern wetlands can provide viable habitat for this critically endangered species in the near future.</p>
<p>Evaluation of juvenile tortoises released into suitable wetlands in an assisted colonisation trial showed increase in body mass over the 2021 and 2022 hydroperiods before moving into aestivation for the summer and autumn months, with a positive relationship between tortoise activity levels and carapace temperature. A highly sensitive environmental DNA (eDNA) test specific to the western swamp tortoise has been developed, which can successfully detect the tortoises at assisted colonisation sites. A molecular dietary analysis is underway to better understand the tortoise&rsquo;s impact on their recipient ecosystem.</p>

                                <p>Submerged macrophytes play a fundamental role in the functioning of freshwater lakes and rivers providing food, refugia, shade and influencing physico-chemical conditions. A submerged macrophyte community has been an important part of the Canning River Kent Street Weir Pool (KSW) for decades. Recent observations suggest it has disappeared from the weir pool. This project aims to determine the changes in water quality in the weir pool over the last 20 years, determine the historical extent of submerged macrophytes in the weir and investigate reasons for their changes in abundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This research has confirmed that there was no submerged macrophyte community in the KSW and determined that it had been consistently absent since 2017. Changes in light levels, influenced by management of the upgraded weir, were suggested as the likely cause of macrophyte loss. A journal article is in development.</p>

                                <p>This project aims to examine the effects of cryopreservation on metabolism of plant tissues, with emphasis on mitochondrial function as these organelles are the primary sources of energy molecules (ATP) that drive all cellular processes including the ability to recover from injury sustained to cells and tissues during the various steps of cryopreservation. A better understanding of the effects of cryogenic injury will enable better optimisation of cryopreservation for sensitive species, including many threatened taxa where ex situ storage remains a problem.</p>
<p>Trials measuring oxygen consumption of Daucus carota cells on the Seahorse XF analyser identified that certain cryoprotective agents show a significant negative effect on mitochondrial function. This work was presented at the IV International Symposium on Plant Cryopreservation. Further experiments on the viability of the Seahorse method using respiratory inhibitors to determine the specific parameters of mitochondrial function affected are in progress. The study species will be used to optimise methods for application to threatened species of native WA plants from the Kings Park tissue culture collection.</p>

                                <p>Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly used to survey freshwater biodiversity, but complexities of flowing waters can limit interpretation of results in riverine environments. Inferences on species distribution are based on the unidirectional flow with assumptions of how far upstream the source of the DNA might occur. This project aims to measure the movement of a synthetic DNA tracer injected into a river, and the rate of loss with distance from the source. Modelling of the experiment will be conducted to inform how eDNA sampling can be used to inform spatial distributions of biodiversity along river reaches. Outcomes from this research will assist in applying novel eDNA methods to monitor the biodiversity of flowing, freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<p>An experiment has been planned for Southern River and initial measurements of stream morphology and flows have been undertaken to develop a local flow rating curve. The synthetic DNA tracer and primers have been designed, based on American flamingo (<em>Phoenicopterus ruber</em>), and specificity testing is underway to ensure the final tracer will be unique to the experiment environment.</p>

This project aims to understand how the diet of banded and rufous hare-wallabies may influence the outcomes of the ecological restoration of Dirk Hartog Island.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All scat samples chosen for the dietary analysis in this project have had DNA extracted, amplified using two primer sets, and sent for sequencing. Sequencing results have been returned for the first primer set and bioinformatic analysis for these are in progress. Writing has commenced for diet study chapters and a review-style paper/chapter.

This work will be used in a population viability analysis (PVA) model to inform optimal founder size and ratios, while minimising the impact on the source population(s).</p>
<p>Results of this work found that all three Shark Bay mouse populations have relatively low genetic diversity and differentiation between populations, with marginally more variability present in the original source on Bernier Island. The PVA suggested that the optimal ratio of founders was 80 from Northwest Island and 40-50 from Bernier Island in a female-biased (1.5:1) sex ratio, the first stage of which has now been implemented.</p>

                                <p><em>Syzygium paniculatum</em> and <em>Syzygium australe</em> are two rainforest species with recalcitrant seeds that are not storable by seed banking, with <em>S. paniculatum</em> currently threatened in its native habitat. The objective of this project is to develop a viable cryopreservation protocol for these species. Tissue cultured shoots offer an alternative explant source for cryopreservation and <em>ex situ</em> conservation of these and other threatened recalcitrant-seeded Australian species. <em>Syzygium</em> species have a strong tolerance to long incubation times in cryoprotective agents (CPAs) but exhibit a complete lack of survival following liquid nitrogen exposure, which could indicate that post-cryogenic failure is primarily due to either insufficient vitrification promotion and/or insufficient suppression of ice formation. Thermo-analytical assessments (differential scanning calorimetry) measured the extent of ice formation in shoot tissues, permitting differentiation between cell death by actual ice damage and other stress factors such as CPA toxicity and reactive oxygen species damage. </p>

                                <p>Fire is a dominant disturbance that shapes species and ecosystems. Many plant species have developed strategies and adaptations to cope with certain fire regimes. If fire occurs too frequently, too intensely, or otherwise outside of the limits of a species' tolerance, then populations are likely to decline or disappear. This project aims to determine the impact of varying fire regimes on the demographics of key banksia woodland plant species.</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis have been completed. Demographic surveys have identified changes in population size structures, flowering and canopy seed bank accumulation for six woody plant species. Some species have evidence of inter-fire recruitment.&nbsp;Juvenile periods ranged from 1.3-4.1 years and varied by fire response, seed bank storage mode and growth form. Canopy seed banks were not observed to accumulate over time, consistent with observations of weak serotiny in banksia&nbsp;woodlands. A field experiment showed how timing of seed planting throughout the year (emulating the timing of fire) influences seedling recruitment, where recruitment is best when seeds are cued for germination immediately prior to winter rainfall. One review paper (on fire season effect mechanisms) and one experimental paper (on fire seasonal germination and emergence patterns) have been published. Papers on population structure and reproductive patterns are in late draft. </p>

                                <p>The night parrot (<em>Pezoporus occidentalis</em>) is an enigmatic ground dwelling parrot that is believed to occur across arid Australia but has rarely been seen as it is nocturnal and occupies remote habitat. Recent discovery of birds in Queensland and Western Australia has provided an opportunity to study the ecology and biology of this species at several sites across the Australian arid zone. Little is known about habitat use and ecology of this bird, so studies are being undertaken to improve recognition and management of potential habitat.</p>

                                <p>This project aims to improve our understanding of flatback turtles using bio-logging tools such as daily diaries and animal-borne video cameras that collect accelerometry, orientation and swimming performance data. Data are used to analyse the turtles&rsquo; fine-scale vertical and horizontal movements at a foraging ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three papers were published describing flatback diving behaviour at their foraging ground and predator interaction that inform dynamic spatial management of this species in Roebuck Bay Marine Park. Tide and season have been found to strongly impact the turtles' behaviour in the bay. Detailed maps are being produced to help management.&nbsp; A final paper is in preparation and involves incorporating behaviour into habitat suitability modelling in a case study for sea turtles at foraging sites.</p>

                                <p>This research is focussed on understanding feral cat spatial ecology, diet and their impacts on native species in four study sites on the south coast of Western Australia. This research will also test the effectiveness of stable isotope analysis for increasing understanding of feral cat dietary niche and impact on native species. The relationship between prey availability and climate and productivity indices will be studied in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve.</p>
<p>Strong evidence of an ongoing impact of feral cats on native mammals and passerines was found in major conservation areas and fragmented landscapes on the south coast. Both isotopic niche and mixing models validated stomach content analysis and provided insights into feral cat diet over extended time periods. Mixing models using 13C and 15N tracers provided evidence of feral cat predation on the critically endangered western ground parrot (<em>Pezoporus flaviventris</em>), which was not detected in stomach content analysis.</p>
<p>Feral cat habitat preferences were found to be similar to those in other areas of Australia, with moisture gaining sites and regions of high productivity important areas to target in management programs. Areas of native vegetation provided significant refuge value in fragmented landscapes. Investigations into prey availability found that climatic variables and dynamic habitat indices, derived from remote sensed data, could be used to predict small mammal trap success and available biomass. These findings provide insights that can be used to improve timing of control efforts, such as cat baiting, in an adaptive management framework.</p>

                                <p>This project investigated the potential of eDNA to monitor fish in the Canning River. It compared fish assembly data from traditional fyke netting, active filtration eDNA and passively collected eDNA to explore the sensitivity of eDNA survey techniques for monitoring native and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems. The influence of biotic factors (including length) and the environment (pool volume) on eDNA detection of fish was analysed.</p>
<p>DNA extractions, PCR analysis and sequencing of samples collected from 10 sites between dams and weirs is complete. A paper is currently being finalised, using additional sequencing data for the reference library. The study demonstrated that eDNA can detect a wide range of fish taxa and is less labour-intensive than fyke netting. The project also highlighted significant gaps in the reference database for Western Australian freshwater species, providing guidance for expanding the reference library for freshwater macrofauna in south-western Australia.</p>

                                <p>Aerial survey is a standard technique used in wildlife management to estimate population abundance and detect trends.&nbsp; It is particularly useful for species with&nbsp;large ranges and broad distribution patterns, such as marine mammals, as the technique allows relatively large areas to be covered over short periods of time. While aerial surveys are typically designed for specific target species, additional species are often recorded as surveys are generally infrequent due to expense and logistical constraints. Analyses to estimate abundance of non-target species recorded during surveys can have limitations as information recorded for these species may be constrained or incomplete. In this study, analysis of aerial survey data collected in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, will be extended beyond the target species (dolphins) and applied to humpback whale (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) abundance estimation. While the survey was designed for distance sampling abundance estimation of dolphins, a strip transect approach was taken for humpback whales, and a maximum strip width was not defined. This study will evaluate various strip width estimates derived from the detection functions of comparable cues and a field based trial. &nbsp;An absolute abundance estimate for humpback whales will be calculated using strip-transect based methods, with corrections for availability and perception bias. The methods used here will be evaluated through comparison of these estimates with those derived from photographs taken during the survey, which have a known strip width. The relative density distribution of the species within the area will also be mapped and evaluated. The results of this study will update current knowledge on the abundance and distribution of key marine mammals with a focus on humpback whales in Exmouth Gulf, to inform ongoing monitoring and management of this &lsquo;conservation dependant' population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aerial imagery has been compiled and reviewed to address the biases inherent in aerial survey data. This has included conducting an additional single day of aerial survey to detertmine detection function and strip width for the analysis. The results are being written up.</p>

                                <p>The western grasswren (<em>Amytornis textilis</em>) is restricted to Shark Bay in Western Australia and is listed as Priority Four. The Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological Restoration Project seeks to reintroduce a suite of locally extinct fauna to the island, including the grasswren. However, the western grasswren is probably the most poorly studied of all these species and little is known about its genetics or behaviour. The aim of this project is to investigate the population genetics and behavioural ecology of this cryptic bird species.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Main project outputs included developing ethical guidelines for harvesting individuals&nbsp; and completion of the population viability analysis. There was also an update on the population genetic analysis using updated SNP data, as well as provide finer scale detail about where to harvest individuals from to capture as much genetic diversity as possible in the founder population. All analysis conducted provided guidance on aspects of the translocation of western grasswren to Dirk Hartog Island. Two manuscripts have been published.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>Plant mortality in restoration programs leads to reduced outcomes for biodiversity and is costly for practitioners. Understanding the drivers of mortality, in particular factors influencing soil water availability, is critical. Wind dynamics play a significant role in drying soils and creating atmospheric deficits whereby plants lose water. In altered systems such as restoration environments, the wind dynamics may be different compared to reference communities, and may impact seedling establishment. This project aims to capture reference wind dynamics of many Western Australian ecosystems including the banksia woodland ecosystem, and compare restoration sites to the reference state. Understanding the critical thresholds for wind dynamics and the impacts on plant physiological performance will be assessed for <em>Banksia</em> species.</p>
<p>This study investigated canopy flow in native Australian vegetation and post-mine restoration systems. Implications for altered wind dynamics were used to understand plant functioning <em>in altered environments</em>, providing a significant insight into the role of wind as an abiotic factor in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>

                                <p>According to ecological theory, sympatric species cannot occupy the same niche space. Therefore, the coexistence of sympatric species is thought to be facilitated by the partitioning of resources, differing patterns of habitat utilisation, or both. However, in the tropical savannas of northern Australia 3 sympatric grass finches co-exist. It is thought that the threatened Gouldian finch has a specialised diet of grass seeds and also morphological adaptations for greater dispersal. In contrast, the more common Long-tailed and Masked Finches have a generalist diet, including a greater range of herbaceous seeds and invertebrates, and are also more sedentary in their habitat use and movements. Fire regimes leading to increased movements to locate specialist food resources may increase risks to Gouldian finches, including starvation and/or lost body condition. This study uses stable isotope analysis and novel radio telemetry methods to test hypotheses on diet specialisation, and foraging behaviour in the Kimberley savanna as resource bottlenecks increase as grass seeds become more scarce into the late dry season.</p>
<p>Analyses showed that Gouldian finches visited waterholes less often per day than other finches, leading to over-estimations of some species. Consistent with predictions based on wing length/diet, Gouldian finches dispersed more, and spent less time at foraging sites as seed density declined through the dry season. Masked and long-tailed finches changed diet instead of increasing searches for grass seeds. Gouldian finches preferentially foraged where prescribed burning had occurred, and grass seeds were denser. Late dry season and wet season burnt, and long unburnt habitats were not selected by finches. Two papers were published, another has been accepted and two draft papers are in development.</p>

<p>Eight pressure loggers deployed in nearshore and offshore areas between December 2022 and June 2023 have been retrieved and downloaded. Available datasets have been analysed to identify durations of significant storm surges and boat wakes, as well as durations for wave energy attenuation investigation. Matlab routine&nbsp;for calculating wave properties including wave energy has been created. Next steps include finalizing the wave attenuation dataset, applying appropriate time periods for analysis of durations of storms surges and boat wakes, and calculation of wave energy using wave by wave analysis.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The red-tailed phascogale, <em>Phascogale calura</em>, is listed as conservation-dependent. Due to their highly fragmented and restricted habitat in south-west Western Australia, understanding their genetic structure and diversity can inform conservation action. This study aims to 1) assess genetic structure across wild reserve populations, 2) assess genetic diversity within reserves, 3) determine the genetic outcome of a previous mixed wild-to-wild translocation to Kojonup reserve, and 4) estimate effective wild global population size.</p>
<p>Genomic analysis was completed for 208 samples from 9 reserves. An isolation by distance model best explained the genetic structure, with similar levels of genetic diversity reserves, and no populations showed signs of inbreeding or strong genetic drift. Although Kojonup has retained the diversity of the wider species, the source populations were unevenly represented. Although populations appear to retain connectivity currently, global effective population size was low (Ne 48-117) suggesting the species is vulnerable to future genetic diversity loss.</p>

                                <p>Translocations are a key conservation recovery action for threatened plant species and determining their success is an important aspect of ongoing management. This project is investigating the success of translocation in <em>Banksia brownii</em> and <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa</em>&nbsp;and aims to: (1) compare the mating systems and genetic diversity of translocated populations with wild populations (2) determine how reproductive output and progeny performance of translocated populations compares to wild populations and (3) assess the efficacy of using measures of mating system parameters, genetic diversity and reproductive potential to better understand translocation success. The findings have a number of potential implications for not only assessing long term translocation success, but also improving translocation design and establishment technologies.</p>
<p>Analysis has been completed for genetic diversity, mating system analysis, reproductive output and progeny performance data for <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa</em> and a chapter drafted. A journal article on genetic diversity, mating systems, reproductive output and pollination analysis (for one translocated&nbsp;<em>B. brownii</em>&nbsp;population and four wild populations) has been published in&nbsp;<em>Australian Journal of Botany </em>(Mar 2023). An additional paper using the <em>Banksia brownii</em> genetic material collections and also trait data, co-authored with researchers from Monash University has been submitted to <em>Restoration Ecology</em>. A third paper on comparison of <em>B. brownii</em> progeny fitness traits from a translocated population with those from wild populations is in draft.</p>

<p>An extensive review of the literature has been undertaken and a pilot trail completed to test and refine water and beach sampling methods. Eight quarterly sampling events at 38 beach sites and four estuary regions have been completed. Analytical methods for plastic fragment identification have been developed and sample processing has commenced. The literature review is being developed into a journal article.</p>

                                <p>This project aimed to identify the major correlates of population changes in four critical weight range mammals (woylie, chuditch, koomal, quenda) in the Upper Warren region of Western Australia, including fire history, logging history, climate and weather variation and predator management.</p>
<p>First, this project modelled the associations between red fox and feral cat occurrence and fox baiting intensity, prey abundance and rainfall. Second, this project used structural equation modelling to identify primary productivity and habitat extent as key drivers of historical population change for woylie, chuditch, koomal and quenda populations, and rainfall declines and severe fire as potential drivers of future population declines. Lastly, the project used multi-species abundance modelling and optimisation analyses to demonstrate how fire and red fox management strategies might be optimised to maximise the abundance of species of conservation concern in the Upper Warren. The outcomes of this project demonstrate that managers need to consider the complexity of ecosystems and their local context when designing conservation interventions, and this must be done in an adaptive framework so that management can be continuously improved.</p>

                                <p>Plant physiological condition is a key indicator in the early stages of restoration progress assessment. Current methods to determine condition are difficult to undertake over large areas and are time-consuming. This research project aims to determine if near-surface remote sensing measurements (particularly hyperspectral sensing and thermography) can reliably quantify plant drought stress condition in a biodiverse plant community. Quantitative criteria will be proposed to evaluate restoration success by defining a fast, accurate, and easy to perform methodology, potentially establishing the foundation for scaling up remote imaging platforms that allow monitoring of larger areas in shorter timeframes.</p>
<p>Experiments were completed in glasshouse and filed conditions to explore hyperspectral reflectance (measured with a field spectrometer) as a predictor of plant water status, plant water content, pigment content and maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II, as well as leaf temperature (measured through thermal imagery) to predict stomatal conductance. This approach has now been applied to Banksia woodland restoration sites where five functionally distinct plant species were monitored over 15 months.</p>

                                <p>The status of local populations of a species must be assessed prior to further supplementary translocations. Brushtail possums were reintroduced to the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area in 2007 under the assumption that the local population was extinct. Concerns were raised about potential bottlenecking of sub-populations of the translocated possums in 2017. This project investigated whether viable genetic material could be collected from brushtail possums in the arid zone via baited tracking tunnels; whether there is ongoing evidence of inbreeding or genetic bottlenecking in the brushtail possum population on Matuwa; and whether the phylogenetics of brushtail possums in the arid zone can be assessed through fecal or hair DNA collected through non-invasive techniques.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, viable DNA could not be extracted from either tracking tunnels or relatively fresh possum scats collected near trees. DNA was extracted from two out of 20 preserved possum skins held by the WA Museum, one from Cranbrook and a second from Bendering. Structure analysis of DNA taken from translocated possums suggests considerable genetic admixture between founder populations has occurred. Principal components analysis suggests that the population at Matuwa is significantly different to animals from Cranbrook.</p>

<p>Genetic samples have been sequenced for both SNP markers and chloroplast DNA markers and the data have been analysed. Sequencing nuclear data from gymnosperms is often challenging due to their complex genomes and unfortunately, the SNP data exhibited low resolution; nevertheless, it showed a general pattern of low genetic differentiation amongst populations across the species' main distribution in the southern Jarrah forests, in contrast to the more differentiated disjunct populations located in the Swan region. This geographic pattern was consistent with that shown in the results from the chloroplast genome. In addition, the chloroplast data showed high levels of haplotype diversity within and among populations and no phylogeographic structure, indicating historically large population sizes and high gene flow, with no indication of contraction to refugia through historical climate fluctuations.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>The jarrah (<em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>) and karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>) forests of south-west Western Australia provide a variety of values including timber, wildlife habitat and water. However, as climate changes, issues of forest productivity, tree health and mortality, and water yield need to be addressed. Individual-based modelling (IBM) is an ecological modelling approach that represents individuals within populations or communities, and the interactions between them, with a relatively high level of detail and complexity. This study aims to develop an IBM of tree growth in water limited environments, to parameterise the model for jarrah and karri and to predict the impact of tree thinning on timber production, tree health and mortality and water yield using time series data collected from 1965 and 1992, respectively.</p>
<p>This research has shown that thinning has a positive impact on the growth of both species, with stand growth optimised at intermediate densities (10-20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) over multi-decadal time periods, consistent with findings from previous studies. Thinning also influences allometry of stem diameter with height, ratio of height and diameter, crown width and bark thickness.&nbsp;Two papers were published: the first on the effect of thinning on growth and allometry of karri was published in <em>Southern Forests</em> and the second investigating the effects of above and below ground competition in jarrah and karri forests was published in <em>Forest Ecology and Management</em>.</p>

                                <p>This project aimed to predict the vulnerability of flatback turtle rookeries on the North West Shelf to increasing sand temperatures, sea level rise and increased storm frequency. It has provided critical information for the management of marine turtles and their rookeries by assessing vulnerability and long-term conservation value of different nesting sites and determine if there is need for human intervention.</p>
<p>A paper has been accepted for publication in <em>Ecosphere</em>. The paper describes the vulnerability of flatback turtle rookeries to erosion and inundation and provides a decision tool for the NWSFTCP to make management decisions for this flatback stock. A presentation about these results was made at the 58<sup>th</sup> Australian Marine Sciences Association Conference.</p>

<p>Anti-predator behaviours have been compared in two populations of woylies at Dryandra and Perup. An experimental release of woylies has been conducted to investigate survival consequences of weakened anti-predator responses, adaptability of behaviours over time, and implications for conservation translocations and management.</p>

<p>An optimised cryopreservation method for wild type <em>A. thaliana</em> has been developed using vitamin C- and GSH-deficient mutant plants (vtc2-1, vtc2-4, pad2-1 and cad2), to assess changes in transcriptome using RNA-seq. Assessments of the transcriptome, gene expression by RT-qPRC, oxidized DNA damage and antioxidant contents have been completed to understand the stresses imposed by cryopreservation.

                                <p>Issues arising from habitat fragmentation are exacerbated by a warming and drying climate, land use changes and invasive species. To maintain biodiversity, various management methods are employed, such as prescribing burning or herbicide application. Many of these strategies are macro-organism focused, with less attention paid to microorganisms. Soil fungi play instrumental roles in ecosystem functioning, yet in many ecosystems little is known about how soil fungi respond to prescribed burning and weed control. The Swan Coastal Plain&rsquo;s Banksia woodland is one such ecosystem where there is a gap in knowledge. This project will help fill that knowledge gap and better inform management decisions.</p>
<p>All planned analyses have been completed and journal manuscripts drafted, to answer four key questions regarding the responses of soil fungal communities to 1) time since fire over a 50-year chronosequence, 2) time since fire within the first year, 3) fire and herbicide under field conditions, and 4) a range of herbicides under glasshouse conditions. A breadth of fungal sequences (~20,000) has been identified, with various taxonomic and functional information being assigned. Results suggest that the soil fungal community is very dynamic in the early months of recovery in the post fire environment, but over time it gradually increases in diversity but decreases in relative abundance before plateauing ~30 years post-fire. Herbicide application has complex effects on the soil fungal community within field applications suppressing all observed metrics, but <em>ex-situ </em>application of a herbicide increased abundance and richness, especially of pathogenic species.</p>

Microorganisms have been widely reported to be beneficial for agricultural crops for example through growth stimulation, increased nutrient uptake and plant tolerance against abiotic stress such as drought induced by microbial phytohormone and enzyme signals. Some of these beneficial microorganisms are also present in natural soil systems, however, their role in facilitating seedling establishment is yet to be identified. This project aims to investigate if microorganisms known to benefit agricultural species can be applied to Western Australian natural systems via inoculations. The project also aims to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the positive effects of microorganisms on plants and explore how these findings can be integrated to improve mine site restoration strategies.</span></p>
<p>The results of the project demonstrated rather limited beneficial effects of the selected microbial inoculants on the tested native plant species and highlights that further research is required before advocating the use of commercial microbial inoculant in post-mining ecological restoration. The work also provided an approach to evaluate the use of commercial microbial inoculants through method development and experimental approaches that will be useful for future research.</p>

                                <p>Robust population estimates are fundamental to species conservation and management. This project aims to use lured remote sensor cameras and spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modelling to improve the accuracy of density estimates for chuditch populations.</p>
<p>Spatial distribution of cameras was investigated for chuditch. Results suggested the use of paired cameras set horizontally at 30 cm off the ground with a grid of spacing of 1 km between sites. Comparing two spatial layouts, a grid and a road array, showed that while both layouts produced similar density estimates, but the grid was more reliable. To test the broadscale suitability of a 1 km grid, cameras were deployed in three additional locations: Dryandra National Park, Batalling State Forest and Moopinup Forest Block, and in Julimar to detect changes in chuditch detections over time. Via simulation, the reliability of the density estimates from these deployments are being used to determine adjustments to location-specific surveys to improve reliability.</p>

                                <p>Salt lakes are a distinctive feature of Western Australian inland areas. Several invertebrate groups appear to be far more diverse in Western Australia than anywhere else in Australia and even globally, probably reflecting the long history of aridification and the now disjunct occurrence of this type of wetland in the State. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing (especially in the Wheatbelt) and increasingly, by mining on or near the lake bed. The first goal of the project is to use mitochondrial DNA data and, if necessary, nuclear DNA data, to assess the validity of the morpho-taxonomy of genus <em>Australocypris</em> and to examine mytilocyprdine systematics generally. The second goal is to use molecular data to test alternative hypotheses about species radiations in <em>Australocypris</em>. The final goal is to develop a protocol for hatching and raising adult ostracods from resting eggs in mud samples collected from dry lakes, as a substitute for collecting active ostracods.</p>
<p>A review article on giant ostracods has been published in <em>Marine and Freshwater Research</em>. Extensive genetic analyses have been conducted and a manuscript on the systematics of mytilocypridine ostracods is in preparation. Investigations into the phylogeography and evolutionary history of <em>Australocypris </em>ostracods has been completed and a draft manuscript completed. An experimental analysis of hatching conditions for mytilocypridine eggs has been carried out and analyses completed. A manuscript&nbsp; is nearing completion.</p>

                                <p>Australia has many salt lakes that support a diverse range of invertebrates. Crustaceans are particularly dominant and many species, genera, and even some families are endemic to these environments. The brine shrimp genus <em>Parartemia</em> is a good example, being one of the most diverse, common, and salt-tolerant groups of invertebrates that only occurs in Australian salt lakes. This research focuses on brine shrimp in Australia, with three main aims: 1) use mitochondrial and nuclear markers to evaluate the current morpho-taxonomy of <em>Parartemia</em>, 2) use molecular data to understand the evolutionary history and phylogeography of <em>Parartemia</em>, and 3) examine the distribution and phylogeography of the introduced&nbsp;<em>Artemia</em> in Australia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A manuscript reviewing knowledge of&nbsp;<em>Parartemia</em>&nbsp;is nearing completion. Extensive sampling of COI, 16S and 28S sequences have provided evidence of some new species and conspecific morphotypes within <em>Parartemia </em>and a phylogenetics manuscript is in preparation. Writing is in progress for a phylogeography manuscript. Genetic markers (both mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS-1) are being used to trace the origins and spread of <em>Artemia</em> lineages in Australia. All fieldwork, lab work, and data analyses have been completed, and the writing of this thesis chapter is currently underway.</p>

                                <p>Salt lakes are an iconic feature of Western Australian semi-arid and arid landscapes. Western Australia has a particularly diverse halophilic fauna. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing and, increasingly, by mining. One of the most intriguing invertebrate groups is the snail genus <em>Coxiella</em>, which tolerates periodic drying and high salinities and is the only mollusc occurring in temporarily filled salt lakes. This project focusses on the phylogenetics, phylogeography and physiology of this genus.</p>
<p>A taxonomic assessment of <em>Coxiella</em> has identified 14 species, with 6 considered to be new. This study also included <em>Tomichia </em>from South Africa&nbsp;and <em>Idiopyrgus </em>from South America and confirmed that these plus <em>Coxiella</em> form a family with Gondwanan origins. The phylogeographic study suggested diversification of <em>Coxiella</em> began during the early to mid-Miocene, followed by speciation during the mid to late Miocene and diversification within species during the Pliocene/Pleistocene. Analyses indicated that phylogeographic structure and genetic diversity vary according to biogeography and climatic history. Species exhibited two broad patterns consistent with their distributions in relation to rainfall. Results of salinity tolerance experiments suggested that all&nbsp;<em>Coxiella </em>species can persist across a wide range of salinities (at least 5 &ndash; 90 mS/cm) but upper limits vary between species. <em>Coxiella </em>n. sp 2, in particular, was able to tolerate ~ 135 mS/cm, suggesting that this species may be one of the most salt tolerant gastropods globally.</p>

                                <p>The captive breeding for release program at Perth Zoo for the Western Swamp Tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) makes an essential contribution to the species&rsquo; long-term conservation prospects. In doing so, the program has generated a considerable database on the biology of the captive population. This study investigated retrospective data collected across a total of 9 breeding seasons (years) to determine the factors that influence the species&rsquo; growth and reproduction in captivity.</p>
<p>Diet was the main factor focussed on since nutrition provision is a key husbandry area that is made difficult trying to replicate a species&rsquo; highly specialised wild diet in captivity to a large-scale breeding program. Minor nutritional differences were found between the predominantly red-meat and white-meat only captive diets; the white diet had slightly higher protein and protein to energy ratio, while the red diet had a higher fat content. Captive diets fed to offspring did not show consistent differences for all juvenile growth or aestivation periods. Where differences did occur, the red diet yielded a significantly higher specific growth rate than the white diet. Captive diet fed to breeding females was a more prevalent factor across the reproductive variables with a general, but again not consistent, trend of (where it occurred) the white diet having significantly higher reproductive performance than the red diet. Given the species resilience to reproduce and grow in captivity regardless of minimal nutritional differences, the white captive diet is recommended as more appropriate to the breeding program overall. Of all the factors examined, the variability between breeding seasons was the most consistently significant difference for growth and reproductive variables. These findings considered together highlight the multi-factorial relationship between nutrition, growth and reproduction and the areas still needing further research, like environmental factors in captive breeding settings themselves.</p>

                                <p>Mining companies have a legal responsibility to return native biota to post-mining environments; although ecological restoration is challenging, especially in water limited environments. The chemical and physical properties of substrates do not always explain high seedling mortality therefore other factors such as drought should be explored. This research project aims to improve restoration outcomes by obtaining a greater understanding of the influence of soil water availability and phenotypic plasticity on juvenile plant morphology, physiology and survival in the post iron ore mining environments of semi-arid Western Australia.</p>
<p>All experimental work has been completed including research to (1) understand germination thresholds of semi-arid restoration priority species, (2) investigate how preconditioning seedlings to water stress influences tolerance to subsequent drought in restoration substrates, and (3) understand how propagule type, substrate and water availability influence establishment in restoration environments.

                                <p>The northern quoll (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) is a nocturnal mesopredator threatened by habitat loss due to mining in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and the impacts of mining on the movement and behaviour of northern quolls are poorly known. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap and identify the movement and behaviour of northern quolls living in mining landscapes.</p>
<p>Northern quolls living in the mining landscape situated their broad movement ranges in areas with high proportions of remnant rocky habitat and used all other habitats in proportion to their availability, including mining habitats. On a fine scale, quolls avoided mining habitats relative to rocky habitat in breeding season but used mining habitats at a similar rate to rocky habitat in non-breeding season. This increased use of mining habitats resulted in an increased energetic cost for quolls, potentially leading to sublethal effects such as decreased body condition. The investigation of animal abundances around mining camps using camera traps is ongoing, with all fieldwork completed and image identification and analyses underway.</p>

                                <p>The aim of this project is to increase knowledge about the baseline population and spatial ecology of the numbat population in the Upper Warren region. This information will assist in informing future management practices for this population.</p>
<p>SECR design modelling, based on parameters from a field study, suggests a survey design based on static grids of 6x6 or 7x7 cameras, using Swift 3C wide angle cameras and deployed for between 60-80 days can be used to monitor numbat population trends. Numbats showed selectivity on a macro- and microhabitat scale relating to soil type, distance to a water source, distance from roads, time since timber harvesting, prescribed burning, hollow logs; based on GPS tracking technology. Median female home range size was 29.5 ha in spring and 32.7 ha in autumn (n=13 females). The home range of the two males that were tracked was 80.2 ha and 278.7 ha. A population viability analysis for the Upper Warren indicates the population is most sensitive to mortality rates of females and juveniles. Simulated scenarios suggest increased mortality rates and reduction of carrying capacity due to increased firewood collection, reduced predator control and increased effect of prescribed burning could result in a large drop in population size.</p>

The central aim of this project was to investigate cellular stress responses of the key seagrass species <em>Halophila ovalis</em> in the Swan Canning Estuary on a seasonal scale using novel molecular biomarker techniques such as metabolomics.</p>
<p>Findings were published in <em>Ecological Indicators</em> journal and reported seasonal differences in growth and stress related metabolites.

                                <p>This project examines predator-prey interactions between ghost crabs and hatchling sea turtles on the Ningaloo coast and the Pilbara to better conserve threatened turtle species and manage a native predator. It provides critical information regarding the potential impact of native ghost crabs on turtle eggs and hatchling survival. Results are helping assess the vulnerability of different nesting sites and determine if there is a need for human intervention.</p>
<p>Two papers have been submitted to peer-reviewed journals. The results suggest that &lt;20% of the eggs laid at <em>C. caretta</em> rookeries on the Ningaloo coast successfully hatch and survive the beach crawl to the water mark. Nest inventories implicated native ghost crabs (<em>Ocypode</em> spp.) as the main egg predator at both locations. Additionally, hatchlings were directly and indirectly preyed on via ghost crabs by silver gulls. Predation rates found in this study were higher than those in most studies across the globe. Thus, conservation strategies to reduce predation of <em>C. Caretta</em> eggs and hatchlings in teh region seem urgently needed. Results from this project are being used to determine what the next management actions should be in regard to the high level of predation sustained by the Western Australia loggerhead turtle stock.</p>
