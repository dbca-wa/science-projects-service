            <p>I am pleased to present our Biodiversity and Conservation Science report for 2021-22 as we continue deliver on the government&rsquo;s commitment to build and share biodiversity knowledge for Western Australia. This is achieved through world-class applied science that informs conservation and management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>
<p>We came together as Biodiversity and Conservation Science in 2018 and the science we have undertaken over the past four years has delivered excellent outcomes against the priorities identified in the Science Strategic Plan 2018-2021. These outcomes have been collated in a Report available on the department&rsquo;s website. A new Science Strategic Plan 2022-2025 has been produced and this articulates the outcomes science will deliver to achieve the Department&rsquo;s Strategic Directions 2022-2025. The Plan guides the work we do in Biodiversity and Conservation Science to continue to deliver scientific excellence to support biodiversity conservation.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science provides innovative science through the technical expertise and capability of our science staff and the excellent support of our administration staff. Once again, our staff have shown their professionalism in the face of ongoing challenges, and I am enormously proud of the Biodiversity and Conservation Science team and what we achieve together and with our partners.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, we continue to be highly productive. A major achievement this year has been the launch of the biodiversity data platform, Dandjoo, through the work of the Biodiversity Information Office. This initiative is a State Commonwealth partnership to collate, curate and make available biodiversity data to support environmental management and conservation in Western Australia. Science staff have provided a large amount of scientific information and expertise to support development of the new Forest Management Plan 2024-2033. Other highlights of our scientific endeavours include survey of plastics in the Swan Canning Estuary to contribute to plastic free programs; extensive survey and monitoring of key values in marine parks; development of a fire severity mapping tool that is implemented into analysis and reporting of prescribed burn outcomes; development of historical fire impact and severity mapping layers; development of eDNA approaches to monitoring and species assessment; research and seed banking to support recovery of threatened plants and ecological communities in the Stirling Range following the bushfires of 2018 and 2019; translocation of animals to Dirk Hartog and other sites within Western Australia and captive breeding of species to support recovery programs of threatened fauna, including assisted migration to address climate change impacts.</p>
<p>We continue to pursue new opportunities and seek innovative ways to deliver science to underpin effective biodiversity conservation in Western Australia. Our current focus is on strategic planning, developing our people, engaging with our colleagues, communicating our scientific outcomes, and operating according to our shared values.</p>
<p>Our work is strengthened by our collaborations and partnerships both internally and externally. We continue to work collectively with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and Rottnest Island. We engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the newly established National Environmental Science Program hubs. We value the large number of active science partnerships and our engagement in co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage with all our partners to provide scientific excellence to support the Department&rsquo;s functions and contribute to delivery of the biodiversity science priorities for Western Australia. The scientific information we generate and the biodiversity knowledge we provide is fundamental to ensuring the unique biodiversity we have around us is conserved and valued.</p>

                                    Applied research undertaken by the Animal Science Program seeks to understand the factors and processes critical for conserving Western Australia's rich and unique native fauna. The major objectives of the program are to ensure the persistence of threatened species through local and landscape-scale management actions, including reducing key threats such as predation by foxes and feral cats, inappropriate fire regimes, competition and predation by introduced rodents on islands, as well as assessing cane toad impacts and reconstructing the fauna of rangeland and arid areas.

                                                <p>Barrow Island Nature Reserve is one of Australia's most important conservation reserves, particularly for mammal and marine turtle conservation. It has also been the site of a producing oil field since 1964. In 2003, the Western Australian Government approved the development of the Gorgon gas field off the north west of Barrow Island and associated LNG plant on Barrow Island subject to several environmental offset conditions. One of these offsets was the threatened and priority fauna translocation program that provided for the translocation of selected Barrow Island fauna species to other secure island and mainland sites. This will assist in improving the conservation status of these species and allow the reconstruction of the fauna in some areas. It also provides an opportunity to examine the factors affecting translocation success and improve these where necessary. Targeted species are the golden bandicoot, brushtail possum, spectacled hare-wallaby, boodie, water rat, black and white fairy-wren, and spinifex bird.</p>

                                                <p>To promote species' resilience over vast landscapes, long time-scales and under current rates of environmental change, it is essential for best-practice conservation strategies to: (i) identify historical refugia, areas that offer temporal and climatically stable habitat that species can retreat to, persist in and expand from under changing environmental conditions; (ii) protect key habitat in species&rsquo; current distributions; and (iii) promote population connectivity to maintain metapopulation viability and to retain species&rsquo; evolutionary potential.</p>
<p>Spatio-temporal landscape genetics, combined with Species Distribution Modelling (SDM), offers a novel approach to multi-species conservation planning. This project will provide current and historical insight into how small-medium sized mammals use the Pilbara landscape, providing information for conversation actions and habitat management. Therefore this project is significant in bringing together key government and industry stakeholders engaged in conservation management in the Pilbara. Furthermore, the framework developed for integrating these findings into conservation priorities will be applicable for conservation management, globally.</p>

Increases in threats, including pressure from mining activities across the Pilbara means that a greater understanding of the distribution, abundance and ecology of the bilby is necessary to ensure appropriate conservation and management measures are implemented. This project aims to increase our knowledge of the bilby in the Pilbara bioregion of Western Australia, and develop a regional survey and monitoring program. The current focus is to determine the distribution of the bilby in the Pilbara and to establish appropriate survey and monitoring techniques, including genetic approaches.</p>

<li>Occupancy estimates within the Warralong Bilby Land Management Area (BLMA) derived from 2021 camera trap and 2ha plot data, indicated feral cat occupancy was high (psi = 0.80-0.86) in relation to other recent studies conducted in the Pilbara.</li>
<li>Bilby abundance estimates within the BLMA were lower in 2021 than previous estimates, partly because only one of the two known bilby colonies could be located.</li>
<li>Approximately 7000 Eradicat&reg; baits were aerially deployed within the BLMA. Follow up surveys will estimate feral cat occupancy and bilby abundance/occupancy.</li>

The night parrot has not been adequately surveyed across much of its potential habitat, and a lack of knowledge of foraging and roosting habits has hampered progress in understanding the ecology of the species. This constrains possible recovery actions and management relating to resource development proposals.

                                                <p>The effective control of feral cats is one of the most important native fauna conservation issues in Australia. Development of an effective broad-scale baiting technique, and the incorporation of a suitable toxin for feral cats, is cited as a high priority in the national <em>Threat abatement plan for predation of feral cats</em>, as it is most likely to yield a practical, effective, and cost-efficient method to control feral cat numbers in strategic areas and promote the recovery of threatened fauna.</p>

                                                <p>The Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological Restoration Project aims to restore the ecological condition of Western Australia's largest island to that seen by Dirk Hartog when he landed on the island in 1616. The establishment of populations of 12 mammal and one bird species on Dirk Hartog Island (DHI) over a 12-year period is a key part of this project. Of these species, one is listed as critically endangered, one as endangered and six as vulnerable under the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>. The other three species are either conservation dependent or near threatened. Their successful re-establishment will contribute to improving the overall conservation status of these species. The translocation of 13 native species to an island 633 square km in area makes it the largest fauna reconstruction project in Australia and one of the largest in the world. For successful re-establishment to occur, sheep, feral goats, and feral cats have been removed. The eradication of feral cats represents the most extensive eradication program achieved globally. Genetic information on source populations is being used to inform founder selection, genetic monitoring of released animals, and ongoing management practices.</p>

                                                <p>The heath mouse <em>Pseudomys shortridgei</em> (50-80g) is one of several native rodent species that have declined in distribution and abundance since European colonisation. Originally collected in 1906 near Pingelly in WA&rsquo;s wheatbelt, the heath mouse was thought to be extinct in WA until its rediscovery in 1987. Until 2019, the last confirmed record of the heath mouse in WA was in 2004, from Lake Magenta. Targeted surveys in 2019 resulted in their detection at two locations, confirming that the heath mouse was still extant in WA. Further surveys in 2020 failed to detect the species despite sampling in areas where they had previously been recorded. As there is evidence of a significant decline in the distribution and abundance, further targeted survey is critical to determine the current conservation status of the species in WA and inform recovery action.</p>

<p>Failure to detect the heath mouse in areas where it was previously recorded suggests that this species may be experiencing a range contraction. Alternatively, consecutive years of low rainfall across the range of the heath mouse may have reduced numbers to levels that are difficult to detect. Survey provides information to clarify the conservation status of this species, and to inform decisions regarding the likely management and recovery actions required.</p>
</li>
<li>In-situ conservation actions alone may not be adequate if the abundance of the heath mouse is determined to be critically low. The option of establishing a captive breeding program should be considered.</li>

Funding from mining offset conditions is being used to gain a better understanding of quoll distribution, ecology, demographics and management requirements in the Pilbara. The two major components of the project are monitoring and ecological research. Survey and monitoring of Pilbara northern quoll populations over 10+ years will provide a regional context for understanding population dynamics. Researching northern quoll ecology will provide information related to impacts, such as loss of known or potential habitat critical to the survival of the species, loss of known or potential foraging/dispersal habitat, and introduction of barriers restricting dispersal opportunities and genetic flow.</p>

<li>A comparison of camera trap and live trapping survey methods showed camera trap designs detected declines in northern quoll occupancy with greater statistical power than live trap designs, and were substantially cheaper over a 10 year period.</li>
<li>An optimised camera-trap design has now been implemented as part of the Pilbara northern quoll monitoring program.</li>
<li>An analysis of northern quoll habitat use was published in the journal <em>Landscape Ecology </em>and found quolls were more likely to use patches with high vegetation cover, high den availability, lower amounts of edge habitat relative to patch area, and larger amounts of surrounding rocky habitat.</li>
<li>A similar analysis published in the journal <em>Landscape Ecology</em> found spatial configuration of rocky habitat was more important than the amount of habitat when predicting quoll occupancy and abundance; northern quolls were less abundant in landscapes that were more fragmented. In addition, northern quolls favoured areas that were topographically rugged and received more rainfall.</li>
<li>A review of northern quoll research at the national level published in <em>Australian Mammalogy</em> found that while a considerable amount of research has been focused on the Pilbara population, more work is needed quantify the long term impacts of mining and to assess likely impacts of invading cane toads.</li>
<li>Trials continued examining the efficacy of Felixer&reg; feral cat grooming traps in toxic mode.</li>
<li>A major review of progress of the Pilbara Northern Quoll Research Program is being finalised.</li>

<li>Fine-scale habitat use of northern quolls indicates the importance of well-connected and vegetated rugged rocky outcrops and riparian areas as important habitat.</li>

                                                <p>The Pilbara olive python (<em>Liasis olivaceus barroni) </em>is a threatened species confined to the Pilbara and adjacent northern part of the Gascoyne IBRA region. Little is known about its ecology, habitat preferences and conservation threats. It is an apex predator consuming a diet of large birds, reptiles and mammals as an adult, including other threatened species such as northern quolls. A number of potential threats confront Pilbara olive pythons, but their relative importance is not understood. They include the loss of important prey items due to exotic predators; habitat loss and modification from mining activities and infrastructure development; and on a local scale, increases in road kills by vehicular traffic due to resource projects and tourism. The project will resolve some of the unknown life history parameters important for conservation of this species and for effective population monitoring. In particular, research will focus on important habitat elements, the reproductive cycle of the species and the predation of juvenile snakes.</p>

                                                <p>Feral cats are one of the most significant threats to native terrestrial vertebrate species in Australia. The Felixer&trade; cat grooming trap is a novel method of controlling feral cats that takes advantage of their compulsive grooming behaviour. The Felixer unit detects the presence of a feral cat and sprays a lethal dose of 1080 toxic gel onto the fur of the feral cat. The feral cat instinctively grooms itself to remove the gel and, in doing so, ingests a lethal dose of the poison. The unit takes a photograph every time the detection beams are crossed, allowing an assessment of the efficacy of the trap in differentiating feral cats from non-target species.</p>
<p>Proper testing of this new technology is essential to validate if the Felixer is an effective and low-risk feral cat management tool and at what scale they are most effective. This project is a research trial to assess the effectiveness of these traps to deliver feral cat control at a meso-spatial scale (around 10,000 ha) for threatened fauna conservation and recovery. The trials are being conducted in high conservation value areas in and around the Tone-Perup Nature Reserve and the Lake Muir-Byenup Ramsar site.</p>

<li>Safety assessment trials involving captive numbats in the Perth Zoo and wildlife in the field have demonstrated that the Felixer&trade; traps pose no risk to the non-target native wildlife. Of 5,681 detections, Felixer&trade; traps in conservative mode have misidentified one tammar wallaby as a target. An average sized tammar needs to consume the full contents of eight gels within 24 hours to receive a lethal dose of 1080, however this is extremely unlikely to ever occur given safety provisions and animal behaviour.</li>
<li>Three large field trials have been completed. A total of 25 feral cats (33-67% of individuals detected on Felixer&trade; traps) and 42 foxes have been targeted. Preliminary results indicate that feral cat activity in these areas was reduced by 49%, 31% and 78% at the three trials sites, relative to comparative control sites. The reduction of feral cat activity at the treatment sites was sustained for up to five months after the Felixer&trade; traps were removed. </li>

Genetic information can aid resolution of the taxonomic identity of species and sub-species to determine whether they have appropriate conservation listing. At a population level, analysis of the genetic diversity present, and its distribution across extant populations, provides information on the genetic 'health' of threatened species. Concurrent analysis of some of the proximal drivers of genetic change can identify appropriate management responses for declining populations to improve conservation outcomes. Further, emerging genomic technologies enable novel monitoring approaches, expanding the available toolbox for threatened species monitoring. </p>

                                                <p>The orange leaf-nosed bat (<em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em>) and the ghost bat (<em>Macroderma gigas</em>) were both once widespread across Australia but are now restricted to patchily distributed habitat across northern Australia. Isolated populations occur in the Pilbara bioregion, where a distinct form of the orange leaf-nosed bat is recognised (hereafter Pilbara leaf-nosed bat). Both species are considered to be declining in the Pilbara, being highly threatened by habitat loss through mining activity, and are consequently recognised as Vulnerable under State and Commonwealth environmental legislation. Genetic analyses are providing insight into landscape-scale and fine-scale patterns of genetic structure and connectivity in these species. The development of novel genetic techniques for non-invasive monitoring of ghost bats is providing rich insights into roost occupancy patterns and animal movement. Further research is required to address priority knowledge gaps for the species, including estimation of population size and identification and characterisation of critical habitat for each species.</p>

                                                <p>The invasion of cane toads is impacting the biodiversity of the Kimberley, and no technique has been developed to prevent their spread across the landscape. Earlier research has identified that predators, such as northern quolls (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) and goannas, are especially vulnerable to poisoning by toads and that it is possible to train some native predators to avoid eating cane toads. A taste aversion bait to prevent quolls eating toads has been developed and is being trialled during this project. Monitoring of northern quoll and reptile populations on Adolphus Island and mainland sites is required to understand how these species are likely to respond to the arrival of toads on islands.</p>

                                                <p>The use of camera traps is often regarded as an effective tool for fauna survey and monitoring with the assumption that they provide high-quality, cost-effective data. Nevertheless, understanding of appropriate methods for general survey and species detection, particularly in the small to medium sized range of mammals, remains poor. Within the department, the use of camera traps to date has usually been restricted to simple species inventories or behavioural studies, and beyond this, there has been little assessment of deployment methods or appropriate analytical techniques. This has sometimes limited the usefulness of data derived from captured images. Camera traps have the potential to offer a comparatively reliable and relatively unbiased method for monitoring medium to large native and introduced mammal species throughout the state, including several significant cryptic species that are currently not incorporated under the Western Shield fauna monitoring program. Further research is required to validate and assess the temporal and spatial components of different survey designs, methods of deploying camera traps and interpretation of results to determine how best to use remote cameras to provide rigorous data on species detectability and species richness and density.</p>

                                                <p>Comprehensive information about the distribution, abundance and genetic diversity of the chuditch in Western Australia is lacking. Information to date has largely been captured using Western Shield monitoring, and while this has provided some data for selected locations, the monitoring sites and methods used are designed to capture information on a range of species. Consequently, captures of chuditch are often sparse and monitoring is not comprehensive across its distribution. Analysis of Western Shield data suggests that there has been a significant decline in the relative abundance of chuditch in the period 2013-17, although inconsistent trap effort in some years may have confounded this result. Further analyses suggested that the currently sparse data could not provide reliable population size estimates for the species. This project will undertake targeted surveys in poorly sampled areas to fill information gaps using an approach specific to chuditch. Concurrent DNA sampling will improve an understanding of the genetic structure across the entire species range. The information gained will help to inform decisions both in relation to the effective conservation management of chuditch, as well as sourcing animals for translocations to ensure newly established populations are genetically diverse and representative of the species.</p>

                                                <p>Operation Rangelands Restoration commenced in 2000 with the acquisition of Lorna Glen (Matuwa) and Earaheedy (Kurrara Kurrara) ex-pastoral leases by the WA Government. We are working in collaboration with the traditional owners, Tarlka Matuwa Piarku Aboriginal Corporation, who were granted native title (exclusive possession) over the area in 2014, to restore ecosystem function and biodiversity in the rangelands. Matuwa once supported many mammal species, that have suffered large declines. This project seeks to reintroduce 11 arid zone mammal species following the successful suppression of feral cats and foxes. Mammal reconstruction will also contribute to the restoration of rangeland ecosystems through re-establishment of ecosystem services such as digging, grazing/browsing of vegetation and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>The first mammal reintroductions commenced in August 2007 with the release of bilby (<em>Macrotis lagotis</em>) and brushtail possums (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>). Between 2010-2012, mala (<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>), Shark Bay mice (<em>Pseudomys fieldi</em>), boodies (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) and golden bandicoots (<em>Isoodon auratus</em>) were translocated into a 1,100 hectare introduced predator-free fenced enclosure. The enclosure is intended to provide species with an opportunity to acclimatise to the desert environment. The ultimate goal is to release animals outside the enclosure and establish free-ranging, self sustaining populations of these species.</p>

                                                <p>The primary goal of the South West Threatened Fauna Recovery Project (SWTFRP) is to contribute to the recovery of key threatened mammal and bird species at four key sites in south-west Western Australia, through integrating feral cat baiting with existing introduced predator control programs, undertaking monitoring of threatened species and translocations to supplement and establish new, secure populations where necessary. The key sites selected were South Coast reserves, Upper Warren reserves, Dryandra Woodland and Kalbarri National Park.</p>
<p>This project is a component of the SWTFRP, focussing on the southern jarrah forest, which is an important area for the conservation of several mammal and bird species threatened by introduced predators. To date there has been no effective cat control within the southern jarrah forest, including the priority conservation areas within the Upper Warren region. <em>Eradicat</em>&reg; presents an opportunity for developing an important tool within an effective cat control program that is essential to the long-term conservation of imperilled fauna threatened by introduced predators.</p>

                                                <p>Translocation is a valuable conservation tool that can yield significant benefits and can sometimes be costly and high risk. Decisions on translocations include thorough consideration of potential benefits, weighed against costs and risks of the translocation and alternative options for both source populations and release locations. Western Australia is at the forefront of translocations in Australia and has a number of animal translocation programs planned over the next five years. Other States and Territories are also using translocation as a conservation tool, the number of requests to source species from Western Australian populations is increasing. It is important that translocations maximise conservation outcomes for the species without detrimental consequences for source populations and that the cost is proportional to the benefit. A strategic process for making translocation decisions that captures all relevant information on proposed translocations and accounts for uncertainty, will support enhanced and transparent decision-making and proper consideration of risk and uncertainty.</p>

Feral herbivore control is a cost-effective threat management strategy for conserving many threatened and native species in the Kimberley, particularly its small mammal fauna. Feral herbivore control comprises a large part of the Kimberley work program, and the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this program could be improved by impact-focused spatial action planning to identify efficient spatially explicit management strategies that balance the conservation needs of multiple species, while accounting for other funds and opportunities in that timestep.</p>

                                                <p>Carpet pythons are predators of multiple threatened mammal fauna, including the critically endangered Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo (<em>Potorous gilberti</em>). Python predation can reduce adult survival and curtail recruitment. Current 'predator proof' fences, while effective at reducing or eliminating predation by foxes and feral cats, are likely to have little or no effect on levels of python predation.</p>
<p>Python predation has been identified as a significant threat to the Gilbert's potoroo population in the Waychinicup National Park enclosure. In a review of options following the 2015 fire that impacted the only known wild population at Two Peoples Bay, it was considered that management intervention is required to reduce python predation of potoroos within the enclosure. Python predation may be limiting population growth and hence the production of individuals for translocation.</p>

<li>It is clear that carpet pythons are significant predators of Gilbert's potoroo and are constraining population growth in the Waychinicup enclosure, and pose a potential risk to translocations at Two Peoples Bay.</li>
<li>The capture and relocation of large female carpet pythons from the Waychinicup potoroo enclosure and proposed potoroo translocation sites in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve will reduce the predation risk and increase population growth.</li>
<li>Adult females in the months before the breeding season (June-October) and during the breeding season (November-March) do not feed, so telemetered reproductive females can be left in the enclosure to attract males and lead to more python captures. They should be removed from the enclosure at the conclusion of the mating season (December).</li>

It has been designed to mobilise biodiversity data from all environment-related sectors, including industry, government and community organisations, and to support seamless data sharing across the public, private and research sectors and the broader community.</p>
<p>This work will drive improved regulatory decision‑making, providing data for the State&rsquo;s forthcoming Environment Online portal to support digital transformation of environmental assessment and approval.  It also facilitates the exchange of biodiversity data between jurisdictions via with the Commonwealth's national Biodiversity Data Repository being developed by Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment (DAWE). Upon launch, the platform will deliver point, plot and polygon biodiversity data to users, via a geospatial web interface and an Application Programming Interface for developers.</p>

                                                <p>The data collation program of the Biodiversity Information Office (BIO) will bring together data from a range of data sources and providers across industry, government, the public, research sectors and community organisations.  BIO is initially focusing on high volume, high quality datasets, particularly those that are not easily accessible at present, driving a step-change in the availability of biodiversity data in Western Australia.  The data is ingested into the platform after passing automated quality assurance checks, where it is mapped to the Darwin Core biodiversity data standard and undergoes a human‑mediated quality control process before being released to users. </p>
<p>The initial datasets ingested into BIO's Dandjoo biodiversity data sharing platform have been sourced directly from industry, DBCA repositories, the Western Australian Museum, and regulators such as the Department of Water and the Environment (DWER). New data will continually be ingested, through future automated delivery from regulators and BIO's rolling program to identify and source other valuable datasets.  This data collation program will involve outreach to data custodians across all sectors, exploration of technologies to unlock data in pre‑digital documents and ongoing monitoring of existing data to identify temporal and spatial gaps.</p>

                                                <p>A key strategy in conserving biodiversity is collecting field observation data that can be transformed into information, and then knowledge to inform decision making. This biological survey is an invaluable component of conservation programs and because of Western Australia's size, remoteness and inaccessibility of many sites, data collection is typically expensive and data sets are often irreplaceable. A corporately accessible database is required to capture biological survey data and ensure they are readily available. The Western Australian Biological Survey Database, BioSys, is a corporate application designed to load, curate and export complex ecological data. It aims to address the risks and issues described above by providing a secure, central, scalable, and accessible data repository based on modern, modular architecture.</p>

                                    Applied research undertaken by the Ecosystem Science Program seeks to understand the environmental, ecological and biogeographical processes that determine the conservation values, health and productivity of the lands and inland waters managed by the department. The program's research spans two broad themes: biogeography, and how ecosystems function and respond to threatening processes and management.Biological surveys provide information on the composition of communities and distribution of the State's flora and fauna at scales relevant to management questions. Survey data provide the foundation for a range of management activities, including conservation estate planning, assessing the conservation status of species and communities and predicting the impacts of other land uses and threats.The program investigates how ecosystems function and respond to water and land resource management practices and to broadscale threats including salinity, altered hydrology, climate change and habitat fragmentation. Projects include investigations into the nature of threats and monitoring associated ecological responses and effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The program also investigates genetic diversity, evolutionary history and ecological plasticity of plant populations to guide seed collection for restoration.The program collaborates with other parts of the department, museums and herbaria, universities, cooperative research centres, natural resource management groups, CSIRO and other research providers. Partnerships also exist with traditional owners, resource companies and the environmental consulting industry.

                                                <p>Changes in the hydrology of Toolibin Lake and the Lake Bryde catchments, due to land clearing, have resulted in these previously ephemeral freshwater wetlands developing a connection with deeper, saline groundwater and becoming degraded. A decline in average rainfall since the 1970s has seen a further decrease in wetland health as surface water flows and wetland hydroperiods decrease in quantity and quality. Robust management decisions require the main hydrological driver(s) of change to be identified and spatial and temporal fluxes (water and solutes) to be characterised. This project will significantly advance hydrological studies at Toolibin Lake and Lake Bryde by making full use of the data collection and analyses undertaken to date to produce practical tools for answering the key hydrological management questions.</p>

                                                <p>Ecological monitoring is a key element of adaptive conservation management projects, but can be resource intensive. In recent years techniques such as camera traps, audio recorders and satellite tracking have improved effectiveness of monitoring programs. Metabarcoding and environmental DNA (eDNA) are emerging technologies that may be used to enhance environmental monitoring. While no single tool can provide all the information necessary for monitoring, eDNA has some advantages over other methods in some situations. For example, significant taxonomic expertise is often required to identify taxa, especially invertebrates, but such expertise is increasingly unavailable. Additionally, some existing methods are not ideal for detecting elusive or poorly known taxa and can be laborious. eDNA may overcome some of these limitations, and this project will examine how eDNA can be effectively used as a monitoring tool, complementing existing methods and projects for biodiversity conservation.</p>

<li>Comparative analysis of two small acacia shrubs with patchy distributions, <em>Acacia hilliana</em> and <em>A. spondylophylla, </em>show genetic differentiation among populations indicating some restrictions to gene flow in contrast to the widespread gene flow in the tree species. A manuscript has been accepted for publication by the journal <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>.<em><br /></em></li>
<li>Analysis of the small shrub <em>Mirbelia viminalis</em> shows genetic diversity similar to other widespread Pilbara species and genetic differentiation among populations, indicating some restrictions to gene flow as found for other Pilbara species of low stature. A manuscript is under review by the <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>.</li>
<li>Analysis of two widespread shrubs, <em>Petalostylis labicheoides</em> and <em>Indigofera monophylla,</em> showed higher genetic diversity in <em>I. monophylla</em> than in <em>P. labicheoides</em>, and slightly higher diversity was located in the Hamersley Ranges for both species. A divergent lineage of <em>P. labicheoides</em> was detected in the northeast Pilbara, and some structure in <em>I. monophylla</em> indicated higher levels of range-wide differentiation in these shrubs compared to widespread trees. A manuscript is currently under review in <em>Annals of Botany</em>.</li>
<li>Analysis of genetic diversity in <em>Senna glutinosa</em> subsp. g<em>lutinosa </em>found a high level of identical genotypes in populations, and further analysis of seedlings revealed them to have identical genotypes as the mother plant. This indicates that the species has a high level of apomixis in its mating system, although some sexual reproduction was evident. There was no pattern of geographic structure in the species and evidence of long distance seed dispersal likely driven by water movement following cyclonic activity. A paper is in preparation.</li>
<li>A synthesis manuscript is being prepared that summarises broad genetic patterns in eleven Pilbara species, focusing on seed collection zones and provenancing for mining restoration. </li>

<li>Understanding patterns of genetic diversity provides information for seed collection strategies in restoration and revegetation. Analysis of a range of species in the Pilbara provides information to support effective mine site restoration.</li>
<li>While one tree species, <em>E. leucophloia</em>, showed a pattern of ranges in the Pilbara being refugia, other species have not. The low level of differentiation in other tree species and large shrubs, such as <em>C. hamersleyana </em>and <em>A.</em> <em>pruinocarpa</em>, <em>I. monophylla</em>, imply that seed resources for land rehabilitation and mine site revegetation programs for these species can be selected from a wide distributional range within the Pilbara. This is similar for <em>P. labicheoides, </em>after excluding the divergent lineage<em>.</em></li>
<li>High genetic differentiation within species such as <em>A. hilliana</em>, <em>A. spondylophylla and</em> <em>M. viminalis </em>that have more restricted and patchy distributions indicate more limited seed collection zones are appropriate. </li>

                                                <p>Biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of ecological processes that include balances and fluxes of water, energy and biogeochemistry. These processes are considered in a number of coarse scale ecological assessment and management frameworks but these frameworks are difficult to apply at finer or local scales, where an appreciation of hydrological variation is important. To increase confidence in applying coarse scale management frameworks at finer scales, they need to be verified by results from targeted, critical, local scale ecosystem investigations. Critical ecosystem sites are selected where dominant processes driving their behaviour are complex but not unique, so that frameworks for ecosystems with similar hydrological function and response to change can be assessed. The project will investigate the hydrological function of local scale critical water dependent ecosystems, determine and improve our understanding of dominant hydrological processes controlling their physico-chemical sensitivity and responses to change, and feed the results back into coarser scale ecosystem management frameworks. Local scale sites will be selected where ecohydrological data can be collected and integrated with existing biophysical datasets and information to optimise the transferability of hydrological results and outcomes to other areas.</p>

The main threat to the springs is a reduction in dry season groundwater discharge and spring flow.</li>

                                                <p>A decline in vegetation density in the north-east of the Forest Management Plan area was noted in <em>mid-term review of performance of the Forest Management Plan 2014-2023</em>. The decline is broadly consistent with climate change predictions, although other factors may be contributing. Previous research suggests that <em>Eucalyptus wandoo</em> has been undergoing a series of declines associated with drought and increasing temperatures, and a buprestid beetle (<em>Cisseis fascigera</em>). <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em> and <em>Corymbia calophylla</em> have been reported to be vulnerable to acute drought and heatwave events at water-shedding sites with shallow soils, as well as frost events. </p>
<p>More information is needed about the landscape, site and stand characteristics that predispose forests to decline. This project will build on the information available and investigate the contributing factors. This will provide a greater understanding of the vulnerability of the forest to climate change and assist in developing evidence-based management interventions.</p>

                                                <p>Lifeplan is a global biodiversity survey project funded by the European Research Council and led by the University of Helsinki. As a fundamental data platform, Lifeplan will generate standardised, global data on a range of species groups, allowing quantification of variation in ecological communities at spatial scales from 0.1 km to 10000 km across hundreds of thousands of species. This project is establishing 100 sites globally, with additional denser sampling in the Nordic countries and in Madagascar. Each of the 100+ global sites will consist of paired urban and natural locations. Perth has been selected as one of the global sites, with plots located in woodlands dominated by <em>Banksia</em> and <em>Casuarina</em> in Lowlands Nature Reserve and Kings Park. In addition to investigating global patterns in biodiversity, the project aims to scale up the use of efficient biodiversity monitoring tools (machine learning analysis of ecoacoustics and camera trapping data, and metabarcoding of aerial spores, soil fungi and flying insects). The project will be carried out over six years, with sampling alternating between the Lowlands and Kings Park locations.</p>

                                                <p>This project provides information to underpin the management of karri and jarrah regrowth stands in the immature stage of development (25-120 years old). Regenerated stands have important values for future timber production, biodiversity conservation and as a store of terrestrial carbon. Immature karri stands that regenerated following timber harvesting and bushfire comprise more than 50,000 hectares and represent around one third of the area of karri forest managed by the department. Large parts of the jarrah forest are also comprised of predominantly even-aged regrowth. There are a number of well-designed experiments that investigate the dynamics of naturally regenerated and planted stands managed at a range of stand densities. These experiments span a range of site productivity and climatic gradients and have been measured repeatedly over several decades, providing important information to support and improve management practices.</p>
<p>This project addresses emerging issues for the next decade of forest management, including climate change and declining groundwater levels, interactions with pests and pathogens, and increased recognition of the role of forests in maintaining global carbon cycles. The scope of this project has been broadened to include thinning response of even-aged jarrah stands, with all thinning experiments now covered by this single project plan.</p>

<li>Thinning concentrates the growth potential of a site onto selected trees and provides forest managers with options to manage stands for particular structural characteristics that may be important for wildlife habitat or resilience to disturbance. Thinning is an important tool for managing streamflow and groundwater levels in forested catchments in the face of a drying climate.</li>
<li>Tree mortality associated with <em>Armillaria</em> root disease appears to reduce in older karri stands, and small gaps created by dead trees become less evident as stands mature. Localised tree mortality can be regarded as a natural process and is likely to contribute to patchiness in the mature forest. The extent of tree mortality in managed stands should be monitored to ensure that stand productivity and other forest values remain within acceptable ranges.</li>

<li>Vehicle based spotlight monitoring of mammals on three standardised transects was maintained with six repeat surveys per transect per year. The population of the critically endangered ngwayir (western ringtail possum) in the greater Kingston area remains very low, although this year showed the first increase in detection rate since 2017.</li>
<li>A pedestrian-based spotlight survey within the Upper Warren was conducted in early 2022. A population of 7103 ngwayir (6052 &ndash; 8335 95% CI) across the 38,349 ha area surveyed was estimated using distance sampling methods and density surface modelling. The survey confirmed the very low densities of ngwayir in the greater Kingston area and largely resolved the extent of the regional &lsquo;hotspot&rsquo;. The incidence of severe fire over the last 20 years, landscape position, distance to surface water features and elevation, are among the factors that best explain the current distribution and abundance of ngwayir in the region. Two reports from this work have been published.</li>

Over half of the species are not formally described, but they are consistently named across departmental projects through maintenance of a voucher specimen collection. As opportunities and skills allow, program staff undertake systematics studies (primarily species descriptions and genetic analyses), sometimes with specialist co-authors. This allows formal naming and description of Western Australian endemics that would not otherwise occur and allows species to be consistently identified by external research groups. Tools allowing consistent identification of aquatic invertebrates will also be produced.</p>

The department coordinates documentation on the wetlands' condition and reports to the Commonwealth Government and the Ramsar Secretariat. Like many wetlands globally, Western Australia's Ramsar wetlands are threatened or currently being affected by various factors. These include water resource development, agriculture and urban development, invasive species, mining, plant diseases, salinisation, and climate change. This project aims to undertake monitoring of the State's Ramsar wetlands to improve reporting capabilities and determine efficient monitoring techniques for adaptive management programs.</p>

                                                <p>Peat wetlands are relatively rare in Western Australia but constitute an important habitat for biodiversity where they occur, especially in the far south-west of Western Australia, providing refugia from seasonal and long-term drying for a range of geographically restricted flora and fauna. This includes rare wetland dependent orchids and a total of 21 Priority plant species, short-range endemic aquatic invertebrates, the threatened Australasian bittern and south-west endemic fish.</p>
<p>Some peat wetlands in the Muir-Byenup System Ramsar site wetland suite are threatened by acidification and some have already acidified due to declining groundwater levels. Drying is also making these organic wetlands more prone to catastrophic fires. The peat also can contain a range of toxic metals and metalloids that are released to the environment as they dry. The major aim of this project is to undertake a risk assessment of fire susceptibility and release of acidity and other contaminants. The project will deliver a map of the distribution of at-risk peat wetlands, combined with recommendations for fire management and maintaining water balance.</p>

                                                <p>Little is known about the effects of climate change on the forest ecosystem. A broader understanding of the range of effects that climate change has on forest ecology and functioning, is required to predict how forest ecosystems will respond to future climates. By increasing our understanding, management intervention techniques may be explored that could reduce the severity of changes to forest ecosystems. The Forest Management Plan 2014-23, identified a requirement for research focus on understanding the implications of a drying climate on ecological function, biodiversity and forest health to inform management and development of climate adaptation strategies.</p>

<li>To understand thresholds for drought-vulnerability in terms of soil depth, canopy height, and vegetation cover, three long-term drought die-off research sites in the Northern Jarrah Forest were examined using electrical resistivity equipment, and a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). This work showed a number of zones at die-off sites: zones with shallow soils (1-15m depth) associated with no trees and canopy die-off, and a zone with deeper soils (15m+) associated with less die-off and a taller canopy and higher vegetation cover.</li>
<li>A range of ecological responses to forest thinning have been examined at the Munro demonstration site, including canopy cover, coarse woody debris and the perennial understorey vegetation community.</li>
<li>To examine the impacts of silviculture, rainfall, and forest type on microbial communities, soil samples were collected at 42 ForestCheck sites.</li>
<li>To understand the impacts of climate change and fruit harvesting on fruit production of <em>Banksia grandis</em>, permanent plots have been established in three forest blocks and 2400+ adult trees have been measured.</li>
<li>Established a study to examine the vulnerability of regrowth forests to high severity fire.</li>

                                    The Fire Science Program seeks to inform fire management and biodiversity conservation on lands managed by the department, including state forests, national parks and other conservation reserves. The strategic goal of the program is to ensure that the best available scientific information is used for integrated fire management to protect communities and natural values. Key themes for the program include developing and validating decision support tools for fire management, and understanding the effects of fire regimes on species, ecosystems and landscapes and how these interact with threatening processes including weeds, introduced predators and climate change. Monitoring and learning from the outcomes of prescribed burns and bushfire incidents is also an important activity for the program. Strong collaborative linkages exist with universities, cooperative research centres, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, other government agencies and private sector research providers.

There is a substantial body of scientific evidence that, within ecologically circumscribed parameters, fire diversity can benefit biodiversity at the landscape scale.

                                                <p>Fire severity describes the amount of biomass removed, reduced or substantially altered (e.g. charred) by either unplanned bushfire or planned burning. Severity relates to fire intensity but extends consideration beyond fire behaviour to incorporate ecological effects and structural changes. Thus, fire severity represents a valuable approach to gauge how planned burning or unplanned fire has impacted future fire hazards and the persistence of habitat for flora and fauna. A systematic tool to assess fire severity supports the objective evaluation of the outcomes of decision making, the methods used to apply planned burns, and assists in meeting statutory reporting obligations including fire management performance indicators and potential impacts on listed flora and fauna.</p>

                                                <p>The social and conservation values of remnant natural ecosystems in urban and peri-urban environments can be significant, particularly where they include threatened species and communities, such as the nationally listed 'Banksia woodlands of the Swan Coastal Plain ecological community'. Fire management of these systems is particularly complex as they are often: very close to homes, businesses and infrastructure; exposed to high ignition likelihoods; fragmented; subject to a wide range of other threats and disturbances; and susceptible to invasion or already supporting a number of pest plant and animal species. The spread of grassy weeds, in particular, can be enhanced by fire and promotes changes in fire regime. Knowledge of interactions between fire regimes and weed invasion will provide a basis for synergies in fire and weed management that may deliver beneficial outcomes. The study design and replication, and fuel, plant species and community response data, provide valuable research infrastructure that associated student projects and other studies can use (e.g. soil properties, invertebrate responses).</p>

                                                <p>The Great Western Woodlands (GWW) is an internationally significant area with great biological and cultural richness. This 16 million hectare region of south-western Australia contains the world's largest and most intact area of contiguous temperate woodland. The GWW Conservation Strategy and a review conducted by a wide range of scientific experts, identified inappropriate fire regimes as a threat to the woodlands and emphasised the need for a science-based fire management regime for the area. Critical gaps in the knowledge of fire ecology for GWW ecosystems are a hindrance to ecological fire management in the region. The GWW supports eucalypt woodlands at very low mean annual rainfall (250-350 mm). Many of the woodland eucalypt species are killed by fire (obligate-seeders), and eucalypt recruitment is stimulated by fire but individuals are slow growing. In recent decades a large part of the GWW has been burnt and concern has been expressed over the ecological impacts of this. Fire ecology research already undertaken in eastern Wheatbelt nature reserves will help resolve ecological fire management issues for mallee and mallee-heath communities in the GWW but similar information for the dominant eucalypt woodlands is needed.</p>

<li>On-ground vegetation structure measurements of tree allometry at 274 sites were linked to remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and airborne LiDAR data demonstrating that woodland age classes can be reliably distinguished based on their 3D canopy structure.</li>
<li>Combining high-resolution RPA and medium resolution airborne LiDAR to coarse-resolution GEDI satellite LiDAR covering the whole region, supported identification of vegetation structural features that scale robustly across platforms for development of a draft spatial model of woodland age-class across the whole GWW.</li>
<li>Juvenile period data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence formed part of a south-western Australian-wide analysis estimating juvenile period in slow-maturing serotinous obligate seeders from site productivity predictors. Climate and gross primary productivity were strong predictors of juvenile period, allowing the development of models of juvenile period over space and time under both recent environmental conditions and those projected to occur in the future. This work has been published in <em>Plant Ecology</em>.</li>
<li>Plant trait data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence was provided to a national collaboration cataloguing plant traits (AusTraits), forming a part of the publication in <em>Scientific Data,</em> capturing 448 traits across 28,640 taxa with ~1M trait by taxa combinations.</li>
<li>Plant fire response data from the <em>E. salubris </em>chronosequence formed part of a national synthesis of plant fire-response traits published in the <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolution of fire-response traits showed that resprouting mapped as an ancestral trait, with subsequent independent evolution of post-fire seeding in multiple lineages. The proportion of resprouters and reseeders in an ecosystem was associated with ecosystem productivity and fire regime characteristics.</li>

<li>National-scale syntheses of temperate eucalypt woodland responses to disturbance revealed that many Western Australian woodlands are uniquely dominated by taxa that are obligate seeding, and have vegetation dynamics driven by rare, stand-replacing disturbances. These characteristics illustrate a putative vulnerability to decreases in intervals between fires, and large changes in vegetation composition and structure with time since fire and with variation in prior fire interval. This information contributes to understanding ecological responses to fire. </li>
<li>Post-fire succession in vegetation composition and structure, which in turn determines successional patterns in animals, occurs over multi-century timescales, demonstrating the value of avoiding fire in mature woodlands to maximise future fire management options.</li>
<li>Development of spatial and temporal models of juvenile period in slow-maturing serotinous obligate seeders across the whole of south-western Australia allows identification of where: (i) historic fire intervals may have have led to immaturity risk impacts, assisting in delineation of areas and taxa for which targeted conservation interventions may be most valuable; and (ii) the risks of climate change-driven decreases in fire intervals are greatest and where fire management to support persistence of fire refugia is most important.</li>
<li>A spatial map of multi-century GWW woodland age classes provides the basis for departmental and Ngadju Conservation Aboriginal Corporation fire managers to plan fire mitigation and suppression activities to minimise loss of mature woodlands in bushfires.</li>

The adaptive management program that forms the Landscape Conservation Initiative (LCI) of the <em>Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy</em> commenced in 2011 in response to perceived threats by cattle and fire to biodiversity conservation in the North Kimberley. This initiative is based on the hypothesis that large numbers of introduced herbivores and the impacts of current fire regimes are associated with declines of critical weight range mammals, contraction and degradation of rainforest patches, and degradation of vegetation structure and habitat condition in savannas. This monitoring and evaluation program will provide a report card on performance of landscape management initiatives in the north Kimberley, particularly prescribed burning and cattle culling, in maintaining and improving biodiversity status.</p>

<li>Monitoring at both Wunaamin Miliwundi and Prince Regent National Parks in the north Kimberley indicate that northern quolls have survived cane toad invasion starting 2019. Despite no quolls being recorded in 2021 at Bells Gorge, 3 quolls were trapped in 2022. Single quolls were captured at Mt Hart in 2021 and 2022.</li>
<li>Fire and cattle management at Wunaamin Miliwundi has allowed accumulation of optimal long unburnt and undisturbed savanna vegetation, which has led to increases among threatened mammals including golden backed tree rats, pale field rats and western chestnut mice. These species are otherwise declining across most of northern Australia.</li>
<li>This program has provided feedback on where fire regimes have not achieved benefits to threatened mammals, which has been used by fire managers to fine-tune prescribed burning.</li>
<li>Two journal papers were published in <em>Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution</em> and a third was published in <em> Molecular Ecology</em>. The data contributed to meta-analyses on trends among threatened mammals nationally.</li>

<li>The fire mosaic attribute most closely aligned with high diversity and abundance of threatened mammals is percentage of long unburnt vegetation. This indicates that long unburnt patches are an important target for prescribed burning in the region.</li>
<li>There is now strong evidence that cattle have a negative influence on threatened mammals such as the brush-tailed rabbit rat. This supports continuation of the department's feral cattle culling program for the benefit of threatened mammals and the other groups threatened by cattle.</li>
<li>Feral cats are strongly negatively associated with threatened mammal abundance and richness. In this context, it is important to maintain vegetation cover through fire and cattle management to reduce cat hunting effectiveness.</li>

                                                <p>Western Australia is an orchid biodiversity hotspot of worldwide significance, with an estimated 400 species of orchid, many of which are endemic. There are currently 42 Western Australia orchid taxa listed as threatened, with the key threatening processes being habitat loss due to land clearance and fragmentation, loss of pollinators, weed invasion, illegal collection and habitat degradation. Orchids represent a conservation challenge as they have complex and sometimes highly specific ecological interactions with pollinators above ground and their mycorrhizal partners below ground. Overlaying the immediate needs of the orchid are the independent requirements of the pollinator (nectar sources, brood sites) and the mycorrhizal partner (carbon sources, soil attributes). <em>Ex situ</em> conservation of Western Australia&rsquo;s orchids is undertaken through maintaining a large living collection of orchids, seed banking and maintaining an orchid mycorrhizal library. This collection provides a basis for orchid translocations, propagation, outplanting and monitoring in the form of experimental research and species recovery.</p>

                                                <p>Restoration science is a multidisciplinary approach to provide a comprehensive scientific basis for restoration actions across the State. Overall, the research includes seed science, provenance, ecohydrology, ecophysiology, soil science, community ecology and plant-enabling technologies. Restoration science works across diverse systems including Pilbara grassland and savanna, mid-west shrublands, Swan Coastal Plain banksia woodlands and shrublands, jarrah forest, marine seagrass meadows, and arid coastal communities, through collaboration with a variety of stakeholders. Restoration science is well placed to provide the applied scientific solutions required for all plant community restoration activities.</p>

                                    The broad goal of the Marine Science Program is to ensure the department's marine biodiversity conservation and management programs are based on best practice science. Specifically, the program promotes and undertakes marine research and monitoring to improve the scientific basis for the conservation and management of Western Australia's State-wide system of marine protected areas, threatened marine fauna and marine biodiversity generally. The program also coordinates and manages external marine research programs, such as the current investigation into the bio-physical, social and cultural values of the Kimberley that is undertaken as part of the Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI). The research and monitoring programs undertaken by the Marine Science Program are based around the research and monitoring strategies identified in protected area management plans and threatened species recovery and management plans, ensuring that all activities are linked to departmental priorities and programs.

                                                <p>To conserve WA's marine biodiversity, a network of marine parks has been established under the principles of being comprehensive, adequate and representative. These principles require knowledge of ecological assets over a statewide scale and are complicated by a changing environment. Finfish have been identified as a key ecological asset due to their high ecological and social values. Anthropogenic pressures are leading to shifts in the composition of fish assemblages, and it is unclear how well the current network of marine parks represents fish diversity. This project will combine DBCA finfish monitoring data with information collected by external collaborators to assess fish biodiversity inside and outside of WA marine parks over the last decade. This dataset will be used to describe statewide spatial and temporal patterns of finfish composition and distribution in relation to key pressures, to enable adaptive management and guide marine park planning.</p>

                                                <p>The current lack of knowledge of the Australian snubfin dolphin (<em>Orcaella heinsohni</em>) meant that its conservation status could not be adequately assessed in 2011 due to insufficient information on population dynamics and distribution. This species is known from tropical coastal waters of Australia and New Guinea, but individuals tend to be shy, evasive and difficult to study. Although they range southwards to the Pilbara region of Western Australia, there has been little local based research on this species and much of this remains unpublished. This project will compile existing data on snubfin dolphins across the Kimberley to better understand their habitat use and distribution. The collation of data into a single database will also facilitate the study of population structure and demographics based on recognised individual animals.</p>

<li>A paper on ranging patterns and site fidelity of snubfin dolphins in Yawuru Nagulagun Roebuck Bay Marine Park (YNRBMP) was published in <em>Frontiers in Marine Science</em>. Key findings that will inform management include confirmation that the population of snubfin dolphins that regularly use Roebuck Bay is resident and a subset of a broader population. High use areas have been identified, including the northern part of the bay and the Port of Broome.</li>
<li>A public presentation on snubfin dolphin site fidelity and use of YNRBMP was made to the Broome community and stakeholders.</li>
<li>A vessel-based dolphin survey (census) was undertaken in YNRBMP with regional staff and Yawuru joint managers. The survey confirmed that the population of snubfin dolphins that use YNRBMP has remained relatively stable. </li>
<li>Two presentations were made to volunteers interested in the Dolphin Watch program and using the newly released marine fauna sighting app to record dolphin sightings as a citizen science initiative. Dolphin Watch volunteers also participated in one day of the dolphin census.</li>
<li>The genetic analysis of tissue samples collected from snubfin dolphins in Prince Regent River was completed and a technical report written in partnership with DBCA regional staff and Dambeemangarddee Aboriginal Corporation. The analyses indicate snubfin dolphins from Prince Regent River are not genetically isolated from other populations in the Kimberley, although it is likely that gene flow is limited to potential migration of dolphins from Cygnet Bay to Prince Regent River. This population could be regarded as a distinct management unit and considered to be potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as increased vessel traffic.</li>

<li>Collation of scientific and traditional knowledge of a poorly understood marine mammal of high conservation value means managers now have baseline knowledge of the abundance of snubfin dolphins in YNRBMP..</li>
<li>Establishment of a database for all dolphin research and monitoring where survey and photo-identification data is collected, ensures that standardised data is available for assessing population abundance and distribution. It also provides the capacity to develop sighting histories for individual animals, thus providing a better understanding of population demographics and life history. This database can also be used for information sharing across jurisdictions and between research organisations.</li>
<li>The broad-scale collation of information and modelling has provided relevant information on area of occupancy and extent of occurrence that can be used to assess the conservation status of snubfin dolphins more accurately.</li>
<li>The research has established partnerships with Indigenous sea ranger groups to develop survey methodologies, data storage and reporting structures consistent with Healthy Country and reserve management plans.</li>
<li>The Marine Fauna Sighting app and Finbook photo-identification guide will support ongoing monitoring of the snubfin dolphin population in YNRBMP. They will be used to address the key performance indicators related to maintaining abundance and diversity of these dolphin species in YNRBMP.</li>
<li>A monitoring program for a 3 yearly census of dolphins in YNRBMP will inform ongoing management of these species using the marine park and surrounds.</li>
<li>Understanding the population structure and genetic connectivity of coastal dolphin populations will inform conservation management of these species by identifying populations more vulnerable to anthropogenic impacts.</li>

                                                <p>Small-bodied fish (&lt;5cm) typically account for ~40% of all described fish species on coral reefs and therefore are expected to represent a substantial proportion of fish diversity in the State marine reserves. Short life spans of these small fish also suggest they are important conduits of energy transfer in marine food webs and will respond more rapidly to environmental change and stressors than larger-bodied counterparts. This is especially pertinent along the WA coastline, where marine heatwaves have dramatically impacted habitat, and fishing may have reduced the abundance of small fish predators. Standard visual methods of surveying fish are not suitable for monitoring these small cryptobenthic fish (CRF). This project will investigate whether environmental DNA (eDNA) from water and sediment samples is a viable alternative to collecting with poison (e.g., clove oil) and visual approaches for assessing CRF assemblages. By collecting data from different habitats and management zones within marine parks, the project will also assess how effectively different techniques detect a change in CRF due to spatial variation in environment or management.</p>

                                                <p>Australian snubfin (<em>Orcaella</em> <em>heinsohni</em>), Australian humpback (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) and Indo-Pacific bottlenose (<em>Tursiops aduncus</em>) dolphins inhabit Australia&rsquo;s north-western coastal waters, but little is known about the population sizes, distribution and residency patterns of these species. Current knowledge of these dolphin species in the Pilbara is poor and is limited to a dedicated study of humpback dolphins in Ningaloo Marine Park and Exmouth Gulf, opportunistic surveys and anecdotal sightings throughout the region. Although the presence of several coastal dolphin species is expected in nearshore Pilbara waters (including humpback, snubfin and bottlenose dolphins), very little is currently known of their residency and habitat use patterns.</p>
<p>Human pressures on these species are increasing in the Pilbara through activities associated with expansion of the resources sector, including oil and gas exploration and production, coastal infrastructure development and shipping. While these are key factors that proponents are required to address to secure State and Commonwealth environmental approvals, impact assessments for these species are complicated by the lack of best practice protocols and standards for survey design and data collection, which limits the comparison of different studies and study sites. This project will provide a better understanding of these species and their spatial and temporal use of Pilbara coastal waters, leading to greater certainty in assessing and managing impacts related to industrial developments. This project was designed to meet this priority need under the Wheatstone Offset C program.</p>

This research aims to build on existing knowledge and integrate with current and proposed connectivity projects on habitat-forming and associated taxa in the tropical north-west of Australia. Broadscale connectivity studies of flora and fauna within and between the offshore islands of the north-west continental shelf have shown varying levels of connectivity. Previous studies have also shown limited connectivity between inshore and offshore marine communities, but there have been no studies looking at connectivity and recovery potential between locations within the Pilbara region, and their connections with more distal inshore locations of Ningaloo to the south-west, and the Kimberley to the north-east.</p>

The purpose of the program is to increase the conservation and protection of the Northwest Shelf flatback turtle population through: surveying, monitoring and research; reducing interference to key breeding and feeding locations; and establishing information and education programs. This project coordinates the planning and implementation of works required for the NWSFTCP and coordinates general research and monitoring of marine turtles in Western Australia. The NWSFTCP has a range of governance arrangements that include an advisory committee and a scientific panel. </p>

<li>Sea turtle monitoring requires long term data sets. The foundations are established for a roust monitoring program for the North West Shelf genetic stock of turtles to inform conservation and management decisions.</li>
<li>The flatback turtles foraging project at Roebuck Bay provides insight into biology and ecology of resident flatbacks and provides access to turtles for health studies. It has provided a spatial context to habitat use that can be used by joint managers (DBCA and Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation) to assess how other activities in the bay such as pearling, shipping and recreational boating overlap with flatback turtles.</li>
<li>This program continues to cull foxes at Mundabullanagana Station, which contributes to protection of turtles by directly mitigating mortality of eggs and hatchlings.</li>
<li>Partnerships with Indigenous groups have been an important part of the program. This has enhanced the long-term benefits of the program by providing: a cultural perspective and relevance to the work; positive communication of the program throughout the communities; stability in governance and advice pathways; and a way of transferring information.</li>

                                                <p>Primary productivity provides energy that fuels food webs and is recognised as an important driver of local diversity and secondary production. Hence conservation planning often aims to identify where primary production is high; what systems, including their spatial arrangement, are most productive and how efficiently productivity from these producers is transferred to other systems or consumers. While marine productivity is largely attributable to oceanic phytoplankton, productivity from benthic macrophytes becomes increasingly important in coastal food webs. However, the link between benthic productivity by vascular plants and algae and secondary production remains equivocal. Moreover, local variations in hydrology are likely to influence the supply of nutrients, temperature and light (caused by turbidity), all of which are fundamental determinants of primary productivity. This project will investigate rates of primary productivity and energy transfer in the shallow, turbid waters of the Dampier Archipelago. </p>

                                                <p>Walpole and Nornalup Inlets Marine Park (WNIMP) was created in 2009 to include the entrance channel, Walpole and Nornalup inlet basins and the tidal extent of the Frankland, Deep and Walpole rivers. Invertebrates are recognised as a significant ecological value of the marine park and a key performance indicator (KPI) of management effectiveness. Additionally, benthic invertebrates are a key food source for a range of fish species in WNIMP. The benthic invertebrate community of the inlets was initially described from surveys conducted in 1984 and 1987. The fauna was relatively diverse compared with most estuaries in the south-west of Western Australia because of the predominantly marine conditions that are sustained in the inlets. Few subsequent studies have examined this fauna, and the current knowledge of benthic invertebrates in the system is considered to be inadequate for marine reserve management. Furthermore, as there are strong recreational fishing values associated with the region, understanding trophic links between benthic invertebrates and fish in the estuary is important for management of the marine park.</p>

                                                <p>Macroalgae are a prominent component of tropical benthic communities along the north-west coast of Australia. Within Ningaloo Marine Park, large fields of macroalgae are a distinct feature of the lagoon, covering approximately 2000 hectares. These macroalgal fields are important habitats for fish targeted by recreational fishers and are a focal area for boating activity within the park. Moreover, large seasonal shifts in algal biomass on these and other tropical reefs suggest macroalgae play an important role in nutrient fluxes in Ningaloo and similar systems. Recent work at Ningaloo has quantitatively assessed seasonal variation in biomass and diversity of macroalgal communities. This project will build on the information gained from these initial studies to improve understanding of how macroalgae are distributed across the Ningaloo lagoon and better define the role of macroalgal fields as habitat for fish recruits and adults.</p>

<li>A meta-analysis assessing the value of macroalgae associated with small-scale tropical reef fisheries was published in <em>Fish and Fisheries</em>. The study found that recreational fisheries in the Pilbara and Ningaloo are highly dependent on macroalgal habitats with &gt;50% of the catch being fish that associate with macroalgae.   </li>
<li>Data from fish surveys over the past 10 years were used to examine if abundance of recruit and juvenile fish can predict abundance of adult spangled and yellow tail emperor. Initial modelling suggests juveniles reliably forecast abundance of fish 1-2 years of age, but not older fish.</li>

<li>Tropical macroalgal habitats are important nurseries for fish of ecological and fisheries importance in Ningaloo Marine Park. Canopy forming macroalgal fields are therefore, habitats of high conservation value that should be considered for protection when planning marine reserves.</li>
<li>Identifying locations and environmental conditions that consistently have high abundance and diversity of juvenile fish will help to pinpoint essential nurseries for fish, which as adults play key ecological roles, maintain biodiversity of fish assemblages and/or contribute to local fisheries.</li>
<li>Understanding how climatic processes affect both the supply of juveniles and quality of nursery habitat improves our understanding of temporal fluctuations in fish abundance and ability to predict future populations.</li>
<li>Improving the capacity to predict future abundances of adult fishes, particularly those threatened by changes to habitat, climate and fishing pressure, will help to maintain important social values like recreational fishing</li>

                                                <p>This project uses satellite telemetry to track turtles that are released to the wild with minimal and extensive rehabilitation. In addition, turtles are tracked to identify connectivity between different habitats in their life stages. Commonly, turtles are tracked from nesting beaches to identify habitat, migration routes and resident foraging grounds. The tracking results identify the geographic range and preferred habitats and provide insight into the viability and survivorship of healthy and rehabilitated turtles in the wild. The identification of preferred habitat allows pressures to be identified and prioritised for different size classes. As tracking results will be broadcast live on the internet (updated daily via <a href="http://www.seaturtle.org">www.seaturtle.org</a>) there is a direct link between the department's science activities and the community. The genetic information (derived from samples collected routinely across a range of projects) will provide another layer of information that helps to describe the spatial range of sea turtles in Western Australia.</p>

                                                <p>Seagrasses are foundation species that support important ecosystem services and processes worldwide. Seagrass meadows are declining globally and anthropogenic pressures such as terrestrial run-off, anchor damage and dredging threaten the ecological, economic and social services that seagrass meadows provide. Some of the world's largest and most diverse seagrass meadows occur in Western Australia and support many commercially, recreationally and culturally important fauna. As the condition of seagrass meadows respond readily to pressures, they are used as indicators for the overall effectiveness of management across marine reserves managed by the department. Across-region comparisons and thorough temporal assessments of seagrass condition will provide a broader appreciation of seagrass health among the State&rsquo;s network of marine reserves. Furthermore, a greater understanding of how climate change related pressures (i.e. increased seawater temperature and extreme events) impact seagrass meadows and the ecosystem services they provide, is needed. This is particularly the case in vulnerable regions like Shark Bay, where the full extent of seagrass loss since the 2010-11 marine heatwave in Western Australia&rsquo;s largest World Heritage Area was, until recently, not well understood. </p>

                                                <p>The Kimberley Marine Research Program (KMRP) represents a program of marine research to support the management of the Great Kimberley Marine Park (which includes State marine parks at Camden Sound, Horizontal Falls, North Kimberley, Roebuck Bay and Eighty Mile Beach) and the coastal waters outside of these marine parks. The KMRP was developed and implemented through the Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI), with DBCA as lead agency responsible for the direction, coordination and administration of the program.</p>
<p>A science plan for the KMRP outlines the priority research and information needed to support the management of ecological and social values in the Kimberley region through joint management of the Kimberley marine park network. The plan comprises a suite of multidisciplinary research projects focused around two themes: (1) biophysical and social characterisation, to provide the foundational datasets required for marine park and marine resource management, as well as better understanding and management of current human impacts; and (2) understanding key ecosystem processes, to provide the scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and response to a range of potential human impacts that are likely to arise in the future, including climate change.</p>
<p>The research program was undertaken between 2012 and 2017 and involved up to 80 scientists from eight research or management institutions in Western Australia, working collaboratively on 25 research projects. Indigenous participation and engagement were key components to the success of the research program. All projects involved engagement with Aboriginal people and development of partnerships with the relevant traditional owners, to include their participation and ensure the research outcomes benefit local communities. A key outcome for the KMRP is delivering knowledge to the key end users who benefit most, including the joint managers of marine and coastal waters of the Kimberley.</p>

<li>The KMRP outputs will increase the capacity to manage human impacts in the Kimberley marine reserves and improve understanding of the ecological and socio-cultural significance of the biodiversity assets of the Kimberley for joint managers, industry and the community. The program also enhances the capacity of Indigenous rangers and working relationships with Indigenous communities, thereby increasing the opportunity for more productive and bipartisan joint management in the future. Findings are being used in the development of a monitoring program for key biodiversity assets across the Kimberley.</li>

                                                <p>There are two species of <em>Anstisia</em> (formerly <em>Geocrinia</em>) frogs, white-bellied frogs (<em>Anstisia alba) </em>and orange-bellied frogs (<em>A. vitellina)</em>, that have a restricted distribution in south-west Western Australia and are listed as critically endangered and vulnerable, respectively. Whilst these frogs lay large clutches of eggs, the survival rate to adult frogs is low. Captive rearing of eggs to metamorphs is an effective means of overcoming this constraint and providing supplementation of animals into the populations. Egg clutches of both species are collected from the wild and metamorphs are raised and subsequently released to the wild. There is ongoing research and husbandry management to achieve regular and reliable captive breeding in both species.</p>

Many observational studies conducted on Perth Zoo collection animals in the past have provided staff with insight into animal behaviour and generated recommendations on how to improve quality of life (e.g. through specific enrichment or modifications to enclosures or husbandry practices), as well as data to allow comparisons to be made for individual animals over time.</p>

<li>A methodology for data collection was developed that was suitable for behavioural observations for all nocturnal house animals.  Observations on the dibbler's behaviour revealed an increase in out of sight behaviour in response to increased zoo visitor density.</li>
<li>Behavioural observations of orangutan mother and offspring pairs with a focus on use of enrichment items was completed.  Observations were also made of mother and offspring pairs in the two pairs that have offspring approaching the normal age of dispersal away from their mothers.</li>
<li>Observations were made throughout the African Savannah precinct to gather information on the behaviour and location of animals and their visibility from specific visitor viewing areas.</li>
<li>Observations were made within the Australian Bushwalk precinct to determine what factors influence the use of different areas of the exhibit by the resident macropods.  Preliminary analysis indicates that the density of zoo visitors influences the animals' behaviour with a greater number of animals utilising deeper retreat areas when the visitor numbers were highest.</li>
<li>Observations of the binturong pair and how they used exhibit space and furniture led to the addition of another nest box.  Preliminary data analysis revealed that the adult binturong now spend less time interacting with each other, while the female has successfully given birth to two offspring in the new nest box.</li>

Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught dibblers is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Dibblers are one of the species intended for reintroduction to Dirk Hartog Island following cat and goat eradication, and this will be achieved through captive breeding of animals sourced from the midwest islands.</p>

                                                <p>Animals survival depends on good and timely solutions to the problems being experienced. Sometimes problems are widely spaced in time so a problem solving strategy that is not retained in their memory does not provide a substantial cognitive economy to the individual. Among terrestrial mammals, elephants, along with humans and great apes, have large brains, are long-lived and have offspring that require long periods of dependency. Studying the memory of an Asian elephant may allow greater insights into the evolution of cognitive abilities in large brained animals.</p>

Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught numbats is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. A captive breeding program for numbats at Perth Zoo has been in place since 1992. Captive bred numbats have enabled new populations to be established at Boyagin Nature Reserve, Battaling Forest and fenced reserves at Dryandra National Park, Mount Gibson Sanctuary in Western Australia, Yookamurra Sanctuary and Secret Rocks Mallee Refuge (South Australia), and Scotia Sanctuary and Mallee Cliffs National Park (New South Wales).</p>

                                                <p>Keeping charismatic megafauna such as Asian elephants is challenging. Elephants are intelligent, social and long-lived. Managing their welfare and ensuring that they are provided with the best standard of care requires a detailed knowledge of their behaviour. Despite a long history of domestication and keeping in captivity, little research has been conducted into sensory and cognitive functions in elephants. Examining the various components of their behaviour with carefully designed research programs allows us to understand the limits of their intelligence and to be able to modify husbandry and behavioural enrichment programs in order to provide optimal welfare conditions for the elephants.</p>

<li>This project has seen the successful release of 757 leg-banded rehabilitated cockatoos (418 Carnaby&rsquo;s, 53 Baudin&rsquo;s and 286 forest red-tailed black cockatoos).  The total number of cockatoos banded  (all species and all ages) is now 2087 providing data for understanding breeding dynamics of the population.  The rehabilitation techniques and release protocols currently in use provide very high survival rates, as supported by the high number of cockatoos which contributes to the conservation of these three species.</li>

                                                <p>Western swamp tortoises (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) are listed as critically endangered and occur in only two natural populations at very low numbers. Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught tortoises is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Captive bred tortoises have enabled new populations to be established at Moore River Nature Reserve and Mogumber Nature Reserve. Two additional captive insurance populations have been established at Adelaide Zoo and Monarto Zoo (South Australia) to reduce the risks associated with keeping half the global captive population of western swamp tortoises in a single facility.</p>

<li>Seventy-three swamp juvenile tortoises were released into two swamps east of Augusta as part of a planned conservation introduction.</li>
<li>A total of 102 eggs were produced in the captive breeding colony, 71 of which hatched.</li>
<li>A DNA sample was provided to the the UWA-based DNA Zoo Australia research group to construct the whole genome for this species.</li>
<li> An analysis of historical mortalities of western swamp tortoises held in the captive breeding facility indicated that hatchlings derived from eggs requiring manual hatching were more likely to die within 30 days of hatching and that hatchlings derived from small eggs (&lt;6 g) were also more likely to die. Eggs produced by breeding females &lt;20 years of age were less likely to hatch. The majority of mortality occurred in tortoises &lt;6 months of age.</li>
<li>Post-mortem examinations revealed that respiratory pathology was the most commonly reported finding followed by hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal pathologies with disease mainly associated with opportunistic infection in immunologically na&iuml;ve hatchlings.  </li>

                                    Applied flora conservation research seeks to understand the factors and processes that are critical for the conservation of Western Australia's native plant diversity. Major objectives include ensuring the persistence of rare and threatened species, understanding key threats such as Phytophthora dieback and weeds, and improving the understanding of genetic and ecological factors that are vital for the long-term viability of plant species. Strong collaborative linkages exist with universities, cooperative research centres, CSIRO, other research providers such as the National Environmental Science Program and the corporate sector.The program includes the Western Australian Herbarium that houses the State collection of scientific specimens of plants, algae and fungi. Information in the collection underpins the conservation of Western Australian flora. The Herbarium is responsible for: documenting and understanding the diversity of Western Australia's plants, algae and fungi; maintaining a research and archive collection of specimens of all species in these groups from throughout their range in Western Australia; helping the community, industry and researchers understand and identify plants, algae and fungi; contributing to, supporting and servicing the research, conservation and decision-making activities of  government; contributing to taxonomic research by the Australian and the international scientific community; providing authoritative information to government, industry and the community via the FloraBase website and the Herbarium's information management systems.

Actively managing the currency, authority, data quality, and linkages between these datasets is an important task, both for maintaining Florabase and contributing to national and global plant information resources such as the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). WAHerb is the Herbarium's specimen database and is the sole source of specimen data used by Florabase. Imagebank is the Herbarium's image collection.</p>

<li>Phylogenomic analysis of relationships in the <em>Leptospermum</em> genus has been published in <em>Taxon</em>. The analysis shows separation into five clades with other genera nested among them indicating polyphyly and the need for taxonomic revision of this genus. This revision is currently underway by external collaborators.</li>
<li>Additional genomic analysis of one of the Western Australian <em>Leptospermum</em> clades (10 spp) showed that 3 species in this group are taxonomically sound, while two other pairs of species (<em>L. nitens</em> + <em>L. roei</em> and <em>L. incanum</em> + <em>L</em>. sp. Peak Charles) are indistinct. A more complex relationship between <em>L. erubescens</em> and <em>L. oligandrum</em> will require further morphological assessment to determine the appropriate taxonomic outcome. A paper has been published in <em>Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society </em>for the genomic data and a short communication in <em>Nuytsia</em> is currently being written to publish the taxonomic revisions. </li>
<li>Genomic analysis of the nine species of the gimlet complex is near completion and a paper is in preparation.</li>
<li>Genomic analysis and morphological assessment of <em>V. spicata</em> has shown that there is a lack of evidence to support the continued recognition of <em>V. spicata</em> subsp. <em>squamosa</em> as a subspecies distinct from <em>V. spicata</em> subsp. <em>spicata</em>. A paper is in preparation.</li>
<li>Field collections and DNA extractions have been completed for <em>D. obovata</em> and genomic sequencing is currently underway.</li>
<li>Field collections, sequencing and genomic analysis of the <em>C. caeruleum</em> species complex has been completed and a report has been written. A manuscript is in preparation. Genomic data warrant the recognition of at least three distinct species and three independent management units within the south-west species.</li>

<li>The Western Australian Herbarium added 11,317‬ specimens to collections, including 946 specimens of priority taxa, 116 specimens of threatened taxa, and one specimen of a presumed extinct taxon (<em>Acacia prismifolia</em>), increasing the size of the collection to 833,034 catalogued items representing more than 18,600 taxa.</li>
<li>The metadata of more than 86,000 specimens was updated during the year.</li>
<li>The Western Australia Herbarium shared specimens with 9 national and 16 international institutions, and shipped 556 specimens in 22 transactions for scientific research. A total of 3508 exchange specimens were sent to collaborating institutions, and 26 requests for 579 tissue samples from herbarium specimens were processed for molecular and other scientific analyses.</li>
<li>Major activities within the collections included substantial and targeted reduction in unprocessed specimens, incorporation of specimens returned to the Western Australian Herbarium from Manjimup (&gt;900 specimens), and incorporation of specimens received from the South West Regional Herbarium (&gt;1100 specimens) and Narambeen Regional Herbarium (280 specimens).</li>
<li>Specimens and data were cited in more than 145 publications; the collection and associated data have been cited 2775 times since the early 1900s.</li>
<li>The Herbarium received a significant donation of more than 5000 specimens from the extensive private collection of Allen Lowrie.</li>
<li>A separate collection of Type specimen photographs was created (currently &gt;1100 items), increasing the space within the Types Vault and improving care of the physical Type specimens.</li>
<li>With the assistance of volunteers, 9600 specimens were mounted.</li>
<li>Volunteer participation continues to be a significant and invaluable resource, despite the impacts of COVID-19 during the year, totaling 10,220 hours - equivalent to approximately 6.5 full time employees. The Herbarium was assisted by 40 regular volunteers and 17 Research Associates.</li>
<li>The Reference Herbarium was accessed 2705 times by visitors and consultants for plant identifications and other scientific purposes.</li>
<li>The Research Collection was accessed 1400 times by visitors for the study and identification of taxa.</li>
<li>More than 6100 high resolution images of Herbarium specimens were captured and shared with departmental staff and industry consultants and a further 98 high resolution images of type specimens were captured and shared with the online Global Plants Initiative. Specimen imaging focussed on the West Kimberley and Pilbara Threatened and Priority taxa, an initiative to digitally transform the Herbarium collections.</li>
<li>The Herbarium Identification Program provided identifications to a range of clients, including departmental staff, other government agencies, environmental consultancies, regional herbaria and the public. More than 10,080 specimen identifications in 328 transactions, along with 300 image-based identifications, were undertaken for external clients. A further 120 specimen re-identifications were undertaken for Species and Communities Branch.</li>
<li>Educational programs consisted of 14 Herbarium tours and monthly induction sessions for departmental staff, tertiary institutions, environmental consultancies, community groups and the media (approximately 260 participants). The Herbarium also trained a UWA Work Integrated Learning intern.</li>
<li>The Collections Management team was highlighted in the Winter 2022 Landscope; and the facebook page, with more than 7000 followers, shares a monthly 'Plant of the Month'.</li>

                                                <p>The recognition of poorly defined success criteria and a lack of long term monitoring have highlighted the need for the development of post implementation empirical evaluations of the quality of restoration activities. This recognition has led to the hypothesis that the most ecologically and genetically viable restored populations will be those where reproductive outputs, plant pollinator interactions, levels of genetic diversity, mating systems and patterns of pollen dispersal most closely mimic those found in natural or undisturbed remnant vegetation. These populations are more likely to persist in the long term and contribute to effective ecosystem function through integration into the broader landscape. This project aims to assess the success of restoration in terms of ecological and genetic viability for plant species in the Fitzgerald River-Stirling Range region of Western Australia, where significant investment is being made in restoring connectivity at a landscape scale.</p>

                                                <p>Stinking passionflower (<em>Passiflora foetida</em>), a perennial vine native to South and Central America, is a highly invasive weed in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia and other parts of the world. In the Pilbara, the weed is rapidly expanding its abundance in areas with slightly higher moisture availability than the surrounding landscape, including coastal reserves and riparian habitats. Options for effective management of the weed in these areas are limited and biological control is being investigated as a potential management strategy in collaboration with CSIRO. Limited knowledge of the biology and life history of stinking passionflower is a significant impediment to implementing effective weed management strategies, including biological control. Ecological and genetic characterisation is required to understand the invasion ecology of the species and to guide the search for suitable biological control agents from the native range. </p>

<li>Phylogenetic analyses of whole chloroplast sequences identified three introductions of <em>P. foetida</em> from South and Central America. The data shows a main group that represents the Western Australia, Northern Territory and some of the Queensland locations clustering with samples from Ecuador, and two smaller groups that represent locations in Queensland and New South Wales, one of which clusters with samples from Brazil and the other of which clusters with samples from the Caribbean. </li>
<li>The analyses also identify the phylogenetic relationships of native, commercial and invasive <em>Passiflora</em> in Australia in the context of diversity in the native range of <em>P. foetida</em> in South America.</li>
<li>Information on the relationships among species and the origins of the introductions in Australia has been published in <em>Frontiers in Plant Science</em>.</li>
<li>Genomic analysis of 870 samples from 37 populations from Queensland, 35 populations from the Northern Territory and 14 populations from Western Australia that represent the introduced range in Australia, showed low diversity and confirm the expansion of one of the introduced lineages across northern Australia from the location of introduction in Queensland. Further analysis of samples collected to align with ecological analysis of populations in Western Australia show very low diversity.</li>
<li>A manuscript on genetic diversity across the distribution is in preparation.</li>

                                                <p><em>Tephrosia</em> is a large, pantropical legume genus comprising about 400 species of herbs and shrubs. Sixty-five taxa are currently recognised in the Eremaean and Northern Botanical Provinces of Western Australia, including 26 phrase-named taxa, with a number of species complexes requiring further study. <em>Tephrosia</em> specimens are frequently collected during vegetation surveys for proposed mining developments in northern Western Australia; however, many cannot be adequately identified as they belong to poorly-known, undescribed taxa or species complexes. Their identification is further hindered by the absence of up-to-date taxonomic keys and comparable specimens, as many species of <em>Tephrosia</em> grow in remote areas and are poorly collected. Identification difficulties inhibit the accurate assessment of each taxon's distribution and hence their conservation status.</p>

                                                <p>Seed conservation is a specific and targeted action to conserve biodiversity and entails banking genetic material in the form of seed. Seed banking provides an important opportunity for assessing and utilising genetic material for <em>in situ</em> recovery actions and seed research. Understanding the seed biology and ecology of plant species is important for the conservation and management of conservation significant Western Australian taxa and for developing and implementing recovery plans for rare and threatened flora.</p>

<p>Clarifying the taxonomy and identification of <em>Ptilotus</em>, <em>Gomphrena</em> and <em>Swainsona</em> is important as these genera include indicator species and are significant for rangeland and arid land management and assessment. Many species are annuals and <em>Swainsona</em> is a nitrogen-fixing legume. Some species of <em>Ptilotus</em> have been shown to have high phosphate uptake capabilities and are potentially useful in land restoration and rehabilitation programs. Several species within each genus are listed as threatened flora or are on the priority flora list. Having a sound taxonomic understanding of the species within these genera will enable the department to provide informed advice on the conservation status of the species and the communities they inhabit and how best they can be managed.</p>

                                                <p>With more than 300 known taxa, the triggerplant genus <em>Stylidium</em> is one of Australia's most abundant and diversified genera. While substantial progress has been made over the past 20 years in documenting Australia&rsquo;s <em>Stylidium</em> diversity, our knowledge of the genus remains insufficient for scientific and conservation needs. There are new taxa awaiting formal description, species complexes that remain poorly understood and a number of nomenclature and typification issues that require resolution. The most significant issue at this point, is the lack of an overarching flora treatment for the family Stylidiaceae, which hinders accurate identification by conservation personnel, botanical consultants and other stakeholders. Furthermore, a high proportion of taxa require further surveys to understand the full extent of their distribution and their conservation requirements.</p>

New species continue to be discovered through the taxonomic assessment of herbarium collections, floristic surveys and the botanical assessment of mineral leases. There are more than 1100 putatively new and undescribed taxa on Western Australia&rsquo;s vascular plant census, almost half of which are poorly known, geographically restricted and/or listed as threatened or priority flora. The lack of detailed information on these taxa makes accurate identification problematic and inevitably delays the department&rsquo;s ability to survey and accurately assess their conservation status.</p>

<li>The epacrids, of which <em>Styphelia </em>(in the newly expanded sense) and <em>Leucopogon</em> are the largest genera, have a major centre of diversity in south-west Western Australia. An authoritative source of current information is fundamental to appropriately manage the conservation-listed taxa and the lands on which they occur, for this taxonomically difficult group that is also very susceptible to a number of major threatening processes, including salinity and <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback.</li>

<li>The Western Australian Herbarium added 11,317‬ specimen records in 2021-22.</li>
<li>More than 86,000 specimen records were edited ensuring the hebarium collection data is scientifically valid, up-to-date and aligned with the department's conservation codes.</li>
<li>Customised specimen data reports (species lists and label data) were provided to departmental officers, researchers and the public regularly upon request.</li>
<li>An instance of the Integrated Publishing Toolkit was established in 2022, enabling streamlined delivery of a Darwin Core Archive of the Herbarium data to biodiversity data aggregators on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Through the Australasian Virtual Herbarium and Atlas of Living Australia, almost 33 million herbarium data records were downloaded in 17,000 download events. The Western Australian Herbarium dataset is also available via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF - 875 million records in 19,650 download events) and through Dandjoo.</li>
<li>Data cleaning and migration are underway to transfer records to a new collection management system. This includes the disambiguation of agents (collectors, determiners) and linkage to unique identifiers (ORCID, Wikidata). More than 1.7 million agent entries in WAHerb were linked to 13,923 unique agents.</li>

                                                <p>The Western Australian Plant Census (a component of WACensus) is the authoritative database of the flora (vascular and non vascular plants, algae and fungi) found in Western Australia, including synonyms created by taxonomic change. It is continually updated to reflect changes in our knowledge of the flora. The census constitutes the fundamental master list for many departmental processes and data sets, including the threatened and priority flora databases maintained by the Species and Communities Program, the Herbarium's specimen database (WAHerb), Max (the department software for information based on taxonomic names), <em>Florabase</em> and now <em>Dandjoo </em>(Biodiversity Information Office).</p>
<p>The Australian Plant Census (APC) is a Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria project, part of the National Species List infrastructure, designed to provide a consensus view of all Australian plant taxa. The APC delivers authoritative information on what species occur in Australia as a whole to obtain accurate national statistics and resolve differences in opinion and knowledge for taxa that cross State boundaries. In addition to working systematically through the vascular plant families, the APC process provides for updates as taxonomic changes or new findings are formally published. The consensus also extends from family and genus level to an overall classification of the plants that occur in Australia. The Western Australian Plant Census is updated to reflect the consensus view, produced annually. The APC provides the key name list for the Atlas of Living Australia and the Australasian Virtual Herbarium.</p>

<li>Spatial analysis of the distribution of threatened and data deficient (priority 1-3) flora in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region showed high richness concentrated in specific locations which were mostly ancient geological features of restricted distribution. Data-deficient flora showed distinct patterns of distribution compared to the threatened flora, and 70% of threatened and data-deficient flora populations occurred outside of lands managed primarily for conservation. This work was published in <em>Diversity</em>.</li>
<li>Monitored the Eastern Stirling Range Montane Heath and Thicket TEC following the May 2018 and December 2019 bushfires, allowing analyses quantifying the consequences of the bushfires and interacting threats on threatened flora populations and the TEC, and of the effectiveness of threat mitigation measures such as phosphite spraying to reduce the impact of <em>Phytophthora </em>dieback. Several Stirling Range case studies will feature in an upcoming book on the 2019-20 Australian wildfires.</li>
<li>Contributed fire regime and plant trait data to national desktop syntheses of the putative consequences of the 2019-20 wildfires on plant species and ecological communities, which are reported in two papers published in <em>Global Ecology and Biogeography</em>.</li>

<li>Studies of the effects of fire interval, <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback and threat mitigation actions on population trends for 26 threatened and priority flora in the Stirling Range National Park provided critical information on impacts of 2018 and 2019 fires and priorities for species recovery through <em>in situ </em>threat management and translocation. </li>
<li>Demographic studies and experiments investigating the impact of disease, fire intervals and patchiness, and environmental weeds on <em>Banksia verticillata</em><em>, </em><em>P. pyramidatus</em> and <em>G. curviloba </em>will provide critical information for supporting species recovery.  </li>
<li>Spatial analysis of threatened and priority flora and threats identified ancient, infertile uplands and surface geologies of limited extent within 300-500 km of the present-day coast as hotspots for flora conservation and management. Flora on these geologies have higher frequencies of traits that elevate their susceptibility to extremes in fire interval and <em>Phytophthora</em> dieback. Differences in patterns of spatial distribution of data-deficient and threatened flora suggest that conservation activities directed at mitigating threats to natural populations of threatened flora will not be effective for the conservation management of a significant proportion of the data-deficient flora. This finding emphasises the value of threat mitigation actions in locations supporting numerous data-deficient flora.</li>

                                    The Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis Program seeks to integrate the science and application of remote sensing and spatial analysis into departmental programs. For a department that manages large tracts of terrestrial and marine conservation parks and reserves, the efficient use and analysis of spatial data is crucial for understanding natural processes and informing management actions.In recent times the availability of spatial data has increased dramatically. With this increase in data, the Program is continuing to develop sophisticated statistical analysis, interpretative and automation techniques to synthesise data into a form where they directly assist departmental staff.The program undertakes fire mapping over extensive areas of the State. Utilising time series satellite imagery and ground information,  monitoring programs have been established in the forest, wetland, marine, coastal, rangeland and tropical savanna environments. Species and habitat modelling and spatially explicit assessments, such as risk assessments, allow managers to identify areas of concern and efficiently utilise resources. Program scientists collaborate with other parts of the department, universities, CSIRO, natural resource management groups, resource companies and other research providers.

                                                <p>The mulga rangelands of the Midwest have experienced long-term degradation from the cumulative impact of 150 years of pastoral activity. Changing precipitation regimes and increasing temperatures threaten to further modify the trajectory of ecological condition in these ecosystems, with the impact of vegetation mortality and invasive species both likely to become more pronounced in future decades. However, while the extent of degradation is widely acknowledged, it is not known whether these ecosystems have the ecological capacity to naturally recover when agricultural grazing pressures are removed or how resilient they might be to future climatic extremes.</p>

The imagery used for this analysis is predominantly satellite imagery and includes optical and thermal imagery from airborne platforms. Research areas include historical mapping that utilises the extensive archive record of satellite imagery and occasionally aerial imagery to build a fire history (or fuel age) for a location or to reconstruct the spread of major bushfires. These activities also include monthly mapping during the prescribed burn season. The project also plays a key role in fire research and development, through research into fuel growth, fire spread, fire risk and fire severity models. Internal and collaborative activities are carried out to further streamline and automate mapping techniques. General imagery support is also provided to Fire Management Services Branch and regional staff, including incident mapping and prediction and advice about imagery and systems development.</p>

                                                <p>The measurement and analysis of change across terrestrial, wetland and marine environments using remote sensing provides essential historical and current information that can be used to understand the effects of management actions and natural events. The imagery used is predominantly satellite imagery, and also includes optical imagery from handheld and airborne platforms [manned aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA)] and LiDAR data. Field observations provide essential ground truth and calibration of remotely sensed data. Analysis techniques include an increasing number of sophisticated time series analysis tools and object orientated image classification. This work is underpinned by efficient and statistically rigorous analysis and batch processing techniques in the R programming environment. Remote sensing monitoring relies on repeatable and consistent source imagery and developing methods to produce reliable spatial and statistical products that the department can use for reporting on the State of the Environment, managing the conservation estate and assessing the threats to biodiversity.</p>

                                                <p>The spatial analysis and modelling project develops and utilises tools to assist in the evaluation, interpretation and prediction of conservation values, threatening processes and management actions. These tools generally integrate spatial data sets, expert knowledge and GIS modelling techniques to produce spatially explicit products that can be used to inform decision making. Projects can be focused on species occurrence (e.g. species distribution models, habitat suitability modelling), animal movement (e.g. home range, identification of habitat linkages), landscape scale processes (e.g. assessment of habitat fragmentation) or assessments such as quantifying risk (e.g. risk presented by feral cattle to biodiversity values). Identification of areas of high conservation value for protection is also undertaken by combining numerous conservation value data sets and using software to evaluate possible conservation scenarios. </p>

<li>The department uses vegetation and protected areas statistics to report against aspects of the CAR (comprehensive, adequate, representative) principles.</li>
<li>Spatial information on where significant habitat of the yellow-spotted monitor is likely to occur will be used to optimise the location of cane toad taste aversion training.</li>
<li>Species distribution models provide information on the likelihood of habitat for a species being present and thus are critical for determining species conservation and management priorities and actions.</li>
<li>Information on the conservation values and threats present in each conservation management unit, contributes to the identification of management priorities during the DBCA&rsquo;s Regional conservation planning process.</li>
<li>Prescribed burning is used to mitigate the threat of wildfires in WA&rsquo;s tropical savannas and fire metrics contribute to the assessment of the effectiveness of the burn program against ecologically derived fire pattern targets. In the south-west of WA, varying tolerable fire intervals of different plant species need to be considered during prescribed burn planning.</li>
<li>R software solutions have provided robust and easy to use tools to significantly simplify data analysis for animal scientists and aid in the formulation of quality inputs for complex environmental modelling for the Rivers and Estuaries Branch.</li>
<li>R Shiny interface allows for unique visualisation of data used in a publication and assists with science communication to the public.</li>

Many of the data sets in the Spatial Data Library are identified through departmental project requirements. Large data sets include imagery and digital elevation models captured for general use across the department or for specific projects and have multiple uses such as time series analysis, spatial analysis, modelling, and decision making for management, monitoring, planning and policy. Departmental collaborations also produce key data sets that are important but may not be ready to use or need a license arrangement to be utilised by the department. Making fundamental data sets accessible to all staff through corporate GIS software is an effective way of communicating what science is being undertaken and also assists with determining management priorities and actions.</p>

                                                <p>Parts of the Swan and Canning Rivers are affected by algal blooms, with the species causing blooms varying temporally and spatially. While most algal blooms are harmless, on occasion, toxic blooms occur that can be harmful to the rivers, wildlife and humans. The impact of these blooms on environmental and social values will depend on the type and severity of the bloom. Understanding the dynamics of algal blooms is important in determining their impact and approaches to their control. Regular monitoring of the Swan and Canning Rivers enables retrospective analyses of bloom events and adaptive approaches to in-river bloom management. Many approaches are promoted for managing algal blooms. Finding useful and applicable methods for managing blooms in the Swan and Canning Rivers requires a combination of desktop analyses, laboratory and field based trials. It is also important to consider the potential impact of control products on waterway values.</p>

                                                <p>How fish utilise the Swan Canning Estuary, including distances moved on a daily or seasonal basis and movements in response to changes in environmental condition, remains a key knowledge gap despite a number of detailed studies on fish biology and ecology over the past three decades. This information is particularly important in relation to recreationally targeted fish species that have high value in the Perth community.</p>
<p>Acoustic technology can be utilised to provide valuable information on fish movements relative to water quality parameters, such as salinity and dissolved oxygen, and to major interventions within the river system, such as the Swan Canning Oxygenation Program and the Kent Street Weir fishway. Acoustic technology can also be employed to understand how fish utilise habitats of differing complexity, particularly those that are not suited to traditional sampling methods. An acoustic array in the Swan Canning was established in 2016. </p>

<li>Data on the movement of 120 tagged black bream continue to be analysed relative to historic physico-chemical data derived using the Swan Canning Estuarine Response model.</li>
<li>Acoustic receivers were re-distributed for tracking juvenile Bull sharks (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>) with three caught via non-selective gillnetting and targeted rod and line fishing in 2022.</li>
<li> A combination of V9 and longer lived V16 tags are deployed in tagged sharks. The V9 tags are attached to the dorsal fin of each shark via a rototag. These are expected to transmit a signal every 90 seconds for two years, with the location of the shark recorded by the array when in range. The V16 tags are surgically inserted into the body cavity and have a life of 10 years.</li>

                                                <p>The Swan Canning system is a salt wedge estuary with many freshwater tributaries that have high biodiversity values. Five tributaries have been impounded for water supply purposes. With a growing urban population, demands for fresh water are increasing and finding the balance between the public water supply system and ecological requirements for water is increasingly challenging in a drying climate. It is important to understand the water requirements of freshwater dependent systems in terms of volume, timing and duration of flow to adequately protect them. When ecological water requirements are determined and water provision is set, it is appropriate to monitor to ensure values are maintained and expected outcomes are being achieved. The latter includes consideration of how in-stream barriers and other threatening processes can be managed to maximise value of the flow provisions.</p>

                                                <p>Fish communities exhibit predictable responses to ecosystem degradation and stress, and thus may be used as sensitive indicators of the ecological condition of these systems. Biotic indices, based on fish and other biological communities, are now used worldwide to quantify the ecological health of rivers, lakes, estuaries and many other environments. This project applies a Fish Community Index (FCI) developed by Murdoch University in collaboration with government agencies (2007-12) as a measure of the condition of the Swan Canning River system. This has been part of regular monitoring and reporting on the waterway since 2012 and a report on fish communities in the Swan Canning Riverpark is released to the public annually.</p>

<li>Preliminary results in for the 2022 season show a positive improvement in fish community index scores that are believed to be related to strong freshwater flows in winter 2021. Across the entire estuary, the ecological condition of both nearshore and offshore waters in 2022 was assessed as 'good' based on their fish communities. Combined, the nearshore and offshore index scores for 2022 are the highest ever recorded since regular annual monitoring began in 2012.</li>

                                                <p>In the period spanning 2011-2016, the department and project partners at The University of Western Australia (UWA) and Department of Water and Environmental Regulation resourced the development of a spatially resolved coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model, the Swan Canning Estuarine response model (SCERM). The model is a useful tool that can be used for predictive purposes as well as display. The SCERM model has the capacity to complement but not replace, regular water quality monitoring and to simulate and display information on a wider spatial scale and over finer temporal resolution than the existing weekly water quality reporting. This project explores the capacity of a predictive model framework to rationalise water quality monitoring data, display information in a near real-time format and enhance understanding of the waterway.</p>

                                                <p>Seagrasses are a highly valued component of estuary ecosystems as they improve water quality by reducing sediment resuspension, removing nutrients, providing habitat and as a food source for waterbirds. Seagrasses respond to changes in their physical and chemical environment and are recognised as being a bioindicator of ecosystem health, with loss of seagrass representing degraded conditions. Ensuring that seagrass communities remain viable and resilient is an essential component of effective estuary management. DBCA continues to monitor seagrass throughout the Swan Canning Estuary to inform management decisions on new development proposals and to track the condition of estuarine health.</p>

<li>Seagrass sampling was conducted in the Swan and Canning Estuaries. In general, seagrass presence was slightly higher in 2021-22 compared to the previous season.</li>
<li>Average seagrass percent cover was higher than last year at all sites and this was most evident at the Canning site (most upstream) in mid to late summer.</li>
<li>High rainfall and riverine flow through winter and early spring of 2021 brought significant nutrient load into the lower Swan and Canning Estuaries, resulting in increased cover of macroalgae  between November and January, compared with previous years.</li>
<li>A preliminary trial of remotely operated vehicle technology for benthic habitat assessment identified seagrass habitat in the shallows around Heirisson Island and at Point Fraser. This is the furthest upstream seagrass has been directly observed in the Swan Estuary.</li>
<li>Monitoring data indicates seagrass cover was resilient to high macroalgal cover and strong freshwater flows in 2021 and high temperatures of summer 2022.</li>

                                            <p>This project aims to assess the health and disease status of sea turtles in Western Australia, with a focus on flatback turtles. For stranded dead and injured turtles, pathology is used to diagnose the causes of death and injury, with parasite infections and fibropapilloma virus being specifically investigated. For healthy turtles the project has established a blood chemistry reference baseline which can be used nationally by turtle care facilities.  </p>
<p>The outcomes of this project included the first health assessment of sea turtles in Western Australia, including blood chemistry and reference baselines for nesting and in-water flatback turtles. Processes for pathology and pathology descriptions for flatback turtles were developed and personnel across the state were trained. Knowledge transfer to stakeholders included support for the banning of mass balloon releases in WA. A novel disease related to a multiple species mortality event in Broome (fish kill) was identified, as were a new parasite and haemoparasites in flatback turtles. A paper has been published in the journal <em>Diseases of Aquatic Organisms</em>, three draft manuscripts are in preparation.</p>

                                            <p>This research aimed to comprehensively test the influence of climatic and edaphic variation on the performance of genotypes from multiple provenances, to identify best-practice seed sourcing for restoration. Although many strategies for seed sourcing have been proposed, there are few empirical tests of different strategies. In this project, multiple genetic provenances of <em>Banksia menziesii</em>, a restoration priority plant species on the Swan Coastal Plain, were tested in post-mining rehabilitation field sites, as well as glasshouse growth trials where environmental parameters were modified. In addition, physical, chemical and biological properties of soils from these multiple source sites were assessed and compared to the performance of seeds sourced from these sites.</p>
<p>The project is complete and key findings included glasshouse studies that showed seedlings sourced from wetter regions showed higher growth and mortality when exposed to drought, whereas plants from drier seed sources had lower growth and did not show mortality when exposed to drought. Soil microbiome community and physicochemical analyses from remnant populations of <em>Banksia menziesii</em> across its range showed significant correlations between soil microbiome, soil physicochemical and climate distances. Results of a field trial identified that seed from drier provenances did not show superiority under initial field conditions. All results have been interpreted to better inform seed sourcing strategies under changing environmental conditions.</p>

                                            <p>Globally, harmful algal blooms represent a major and growing threat due to their undesirable ecological, economic and health impacts. <em>Alexandrium</em> species produce toxins that can be concentrated within filter feeding shellfish and other biota. Consumption of seafood containing high levels of these toxins can cause potentially fatal Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). In 2019 and 2020, two significant blooms of <em>Alexandrium minutum</em> occurred in the Swan Canning Riverpark impacting both recreational and commercial fisheries and triggering this research project to examine toxicity and control. </p>
<p>To date, cultures of 2 different strains of <em>A. minutum </em>have been established, one from South Australia and one from Bunbury, WA. A local strain will be collected opportunistically and cultured when a bloom recurs. Development of toxin analysis protocols is underway, and culture material has been used to conduct a laboratory-based assessment of kaolinite clay (with and without addition of poly-alum chloride) as a control option.</p>

                                            <p>Ecosystem resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to return to its former state following a disturbance, and is a key factor in evaluating the success of ecological restoration efforts. Resilience is difficult to measure and is unknown for many restored communities. This project investigates the resilience of banksia woodlands restored after sand mining to fire, specifically seeking to determine an age when restoration is resilient to fire. Investigations will assess resprouting capacity and soil seedbank dynamics across a chronosequence of ages between three and 27 years since restoration.</p>
<p>Responses to small scale burns conducted across the restoration chronosequence have been monitored at both ~6 months and 1 year post fire in the restoration chronosequence. A variety of factors including size, restoration age and soil compaction, was found to influence resprouting success. Regeneration capacity following fire exists across the chronosequence, with different rseponses in older compared to younger restoration. Exploration of soil seedbank dynamics following smoke treatment revealed strong potential for regeneration, with annuals associated with younger restoration and perennials with older restoration.</p>

                                            <p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is endemic to south-west Australia and occupies seasonal wetlands where hydroperiods are shortening due to declining rainfall. Trial assisted colonisation translocations 300-400 kilometres south of their current habitat began in 2016 to test whether <em>P. umbrina</em> can grow in cooler climates where hydroperiods are likely to be more suitable in the future. Early results indicated suitable food availability as a key component. The aims are to 1) develop novel environmental DNA methods to understand diet in new habitats; 2) document foraging behaviour in relation to water temperatures and prey availability; 3) link metabolic processes and food intake to predict long-term growth rates and reproduction in new environments. This will provide greater certainty on whether southern wetlands can provide viable habitat for this critically endangered species in the near future.</p>
<p>Candidate wetlands were evaluated in the East Augusta region in 2020. 73 juvenile tortoises were released in August 2021 as part of a third assisted colonisation trial. Monitoring showed the juvenile tortoises gained an average 5.6% of their initial body mass over the hydroperiod before moving into aestivation for the summer and autumn months. Analysis indicates there is a positive relationship between tortoise activity levels and carapace temperature. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods are being tested as a monitoring tool. A review on the use of environmental DNA in reptile conservation was published in <em>Ecology and Evolution</em>.</p>

                                            <p>Submerged macrophytes play a fundamental role in the functioning of freshwater lakes and rivers providing food, refugia, shade and influencing physico-chemical conditions. A submerged macrophyte community has been a important part of the Canning River Kent Street Weir Pool (KSW) for decades, although, recent observations suggest it has disappeared from the weir pool. This project aims to determine the changes in water quality in the weir pool over the last 20 years, determine the historical extent of submerged macrophytes in the the weir and investigate reasons for their changes in abundance.  </p>
<p>Preliminary GIS work to review historical photos to establish past distribution of submerged macrophytes in the KSW was completed. Macrophytes were surveyed at five sites along a 5 km stretch of the river. Light penetration was also investigated. The influence of light and water quality on changes in abundance and impact on macrophyte growth are being explored.</p>

A better understanding of the effects of cryogenic injury will enable better optimisation of cryopreservation for sensitive species, including many threatened taxa where ex situ storage remains a problem.</p>
<p>Respirometry measurements of shoot tips during cryopreservation using Q2 oxygen sensing technology has been completed and accepted for publication. Continuation of trials measuring oxygen consumption of Daucus carota cells on the Seahorse XF analyser remain to be completed. Further experiments on the viability of the Seahorse method using respiratory inhibitors to determine specific parameters of mitochondrial function are planned. The study species will be used to optimise methods for application to threatened species of native WA plants from the Kings Park tissue culture collection.</p>

Application to freshwater environments in Western Australia has been limited. This project aims to develop passive eDNA sampling methods for biodiversity assessments of river systems that will ultimately build capability within DBCA for large-scale application using methods for which limited expertise or training is required. The research will incorporate two components: 1) an experiment to trace artificial DNA through a river network using passive sampling methods; and 2) the application of passive eDNA sampling methods to a river network seasonally to produce a full biodiversity assessment of the aquatic fauna community, with inferences on the distribution of key species detected in the system.</p>

It is hypothesised that they niche partition through their habitat preferences and the project seeks to understand if this is also reflected in their diet and what function these species may perform in the ecosystem. This project seeks to understand how the diet of banded and rufous hare-wallabies may influence the outcomes of the ecological restoration of Dirk Hartog Island.

<p>Results of this work found that all three Shark Bay mouse populations have relatively low genetic diversity and differentiation between populations, with marginally more variability present in the original source on Bernier Island. The PVA suggested that the optimal ratio of founders was 80 from Northwest Island and 40-50 from Bernier Island in a female-biased (1.5:1) sex ratio, the first stage of which has now been implemented.</p>

                                            <p><em>Syzygium paniculatum</em> and <em>Syzygium australe</em> are two rainforest species with recalcitrant seeds that are not storable by seed banking, with <em>S. paniculatum</em> currently threatened in its native habitat. The objective of this project is to develop a viable cryopreservation protocol for these species. Tissue cultured shoots offer an alternative explant source for cryopreservation and <em>ex situ</em> conservation of these and other threatened recalcitrant-seeded Australian species. <em>Syzygium</em> species have a strong tolerance to long incubation times in cryoprotective agents (CPAs) but exhibit a complete lack of survival following liquid nitrogen exposure, which could indicate that post-cryogenic failure is primarily due to either insufficient vitrification promotion and/or insufficient suppression of ice formation. This study on <em>Syzygium</em> cryopreservation is focussed on investigations using thermo-analytical assessments (differential scanning calorimetry) to measure the extent of ice formation in shoot tissues, permitting the differentiation between cell death by actual ice damage or other stress factors such as CPA toxicity and reactive oxygen species damage. The experimental work has been completed and thesis preparation is underway. </p>

                                            <p>Fire is a dominant disturbance that shapes species and ecosystems. Many plant species have developed strategies and adaptations to cope with certain fire regimes. If fire occurs too frequently, too intensely, or otherwise outside of the limits of a species' tolerance, then populations are likely to decline or disappear. This project aims to determine the impact of varying fire regimes on the demographics of key banksia woodland plant species.</p>
<p>Demographic surveys have identified changes in population size structures, flowering and canopy seed bank accumulation for six woody plant species. Some species have evidence of inter-fire recruitment. Juvenile periods ranged from 1.3-4.1 years and varied by fire response, seed bank storage mode and growth form. Canopy seed banks were not observed to accumulate over time, consistent with observations of weak serotiny in banksia woodlands. A field experiment showed how timing of seed planting throughout the year (emulating the timing of fire) influences seedling recruitment, where recruitment is best when seeds are cued for germination immediately prior to winter rainfall. Data collection and analysis have been completed. One review paper (on fire season effect mechanisms) and one experimental paper (on fire seasonal germination and emergence patterns) have been published. Papers on population structure and reproductive patterns are in late draft.</p>

                                            <p>The night parrot (<em>Pezoporus occidentalis</em>) is an enigmatic ground dwelling parrot that is believed to occur across arid Australia but has rarely been seen as it is nocturnal and occupies remote habitat. Recent discovery of birds in Queensland and Western Australia has provided an opportunity to study the ecology and biology of this species at several sites across the Australian arid zone. Little is known about habitat use and ecology of this bird, so studies are being undertaken to improve recognition and management of potential habitat.</p>
<p>A paper has been published on protocols for acoustic surveys for night parrots. A manuscript on implications for management, and guidelines for appropriate management actions, has been submitted for publication in <em>Biodiversity and Conservation</em>. This project is now complete.</p>

Data are used to analyse the turtles&rsquo; fine-scale vertical and horizontal movements at a foraging ground. </p>
<p>All fieldwork has now been completed. A second paper describing flatback diving behaviour at a foraging ground has been accepted for publication in <em>Royal Society Open Science</em>. Two oral presentations have been given at international conferences. A third paper is about to be submitted to <em>Applied Ecology </em>that looks at fine scale spatio-temporal behavioural patterns of these foraging turtles to inform dynamic spatial management of this species in Roebuck Bay Marine Park. Tide and season have been found to strongly impact the turtles' behaviour in the bay. Detailed maps are being produced to help management. </p>

In addition, the relationship of landscape fragmentation to these factors is being examined. The aim of this PhD project is to improve the understanding of feral cat ecology to increase the effectiveness of feral cat control programs in south coast ecosystems. The thesis will be submitted in 2022.</p>
<p>Movement patterns have been modelled for all feral cats, with significant differences found in activity patterns and home range size across environmental gradients and fragmented and intact ecosystems. Resource selection data from fragmented landscapes have been used to design invasive predator management for Bush Heritage&rsquo;s Fitz-Stirling feral cat control project and will provide recommendations for increasing the efficacy of baiting programs in coastal reserves. Prey availability studies have been completed, with the suitability of remote sensing data to predict optimal baiting periods for south coastal investigated. In addition, dietary preferences of feral cats have been studied across the region using conventional diet analysis and stable isotope techniques. </p>

                                            <p>Seeds of <em>Hibbertia</em> possess complex dormancy and germination requirements. Reliable methods of propagation are yet to be established for most species. Within the jarrah forest of south-west WA, <em>Hibbertia</em> are common, and the inability to propagate their seeds precludes their use in mine site rehabilitation. This project will focus on the germination ecology of <em>Hibbertia</em> seeds through field trials studying the intra- and inter-specific variation in seed dormancy and germination timing of a range of <em>Hibbertia</em> species differing in collection year and location. Through linked laboratory studies, seed pre-treatments applicable to nursery settings will be developed to allow for the large-scale production of <em>Hibbertia</em> seedlings for planting in mine site rehabilitation. </p>

                                            <p>This project investigates the potential of eDNA to monitor fish in the Canning River. It will compare fish assembly data from (1) traditional fyke netting, (2) active filtration eDNA, and (3) passive eDNA to explore the sensitivity of eDNA survey techniques and the role that barriers play in limiting distribution of feral fish. It is hypothesised that eDNA will detect the same range of fish species as fyke netting and will have a greater sensitivity in detecting species in low densities. This research will further the development of an eDNA monitoring protocol to complement traditional methods, leading to the potential for improved stewardship of biodiversity in waterways.</p>
<p>DNA extractions, and PCR analysis and sequencing of samples collected from ten sites between dams and weirs, are complete. The Masters dissertation has been submitted for this project and a paper is being prepared, using some additional sequencing data for the reference library. The study demonstrated that eDNA can detect a wide range of fish taxa and that the less labour-intensive passive sampling is also successful in freshwater systems. The project also highlighted significant gaps in the reference database for Western Australian freshwater species. Work is underway to expand the reference library for freshwater macrofauna in south-western Australia.</p>

                                            <p>Aerial survey is a standard technique used in wildlife management to estimate population abundance and detect trends.  It is particularly useful for species with large ranges and broad distribution patterns, such as marine mammals, as the technique allows relatively large areas to be covered over short periods of time. While aerial surveys are typically designed for specific target species, additional species are often recorded as surveys are generally infrequent due to expense and logistical constraints. Analyses to estimate abundance of non-target species recorded during surveys can have limitations as information recorded for these species may be constrained or incomplete. In this study, analysis of aerial survey data collected in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, will be extended beyond the target species (dolphins) and applied to humpback whale (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) abundance estimation. While the survey was designed for distance sampling abundance estimation of dolphins, a strip transect approach was taken for humpback whales, and a maximum strip width was not defined. This study will evaluate various strip width estimates derived from the detection functions of comparable cues and a field based trial.  An absolute abundance estimate for humpback whales will be calculated using strip-transect based methods, with corrections for availability and perception bias. The methods used here will be evaluated through comparison of these estimates with those derived from photographs taken during the survey, which have a known strip width. The relative density distribution of the species within the area will also be mapped and evaluated. The results of this study will update current knowledge on the abundance and distribution of key marine mammals with a focus on humpback whales in Exmouth Gulf, to inform ongoing monitoring and management of this &lsquo;conservation dependant' population. </p>
<p>The research proposal for this project has been approved and processing of image and aerial survey data relevant to humpback whales has begun.</p>

<p>The meta-analysis investigating factors influencing success of past plant translocations in Western Australia is complete, with a paper describing this work in early draft. A paper on genetic diversity values and mating system parameters of translocated compared to wild source populations of <em>Lambertia orbifolia, </em>has been published in <em>Restoration Ecology</em>. Preliminary analysis of monitoring data from translocated and wild populations of <em>Acacia cochlocarpa</em> subsp. <em>cochlocarpa</em> has commenced to inform whether translocated populations have comparable demographic characteristics (plant height, volume, seed set and seed viability) to wild populations. A glasshouse cross pollination study of <em>Schoenia filifolia</em> to evaluate whether the genetic composition of the founder populations contributes to translocation success has been completed and a paper describing this work has been accepted for publication in <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>.</p>

                                            <p>The western grasswren (<em>Amytornis textilis</em>) is restricted to Shark Bay in Western Australia and is listed as Priority Four. The species formerly occurred on Dirk Hartog Island but became extinct due to non-native herbivores and feral cats. The Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological Restoration Project seeks to reintroduce a suite of locally extinct fauna to the island, including the grasswren. However, the western grasswren is probably the most poorly studied of all these species and little is known about its genetics or behaviour. The aim of this project is to investigate the population genetics and behavioural ecology of this cryptic bird species. This will require intensive studies of colour-banded birds, as well as obtaining tissue samples from a sufficient number of birds to undertake robust genetic analyses. This work will culminate in the development of a population viability analysis which will directly inform the translocation strategy for Dirk Hartog Island.</p>
<p>A final year of fieldwork was undertaken in spring of 2021 at Hamelin Station Reserve to collect breeding data, collect blood samples and gather further audio data. Blood samples were sequenced and a new SNP dataset was created which contains all western grasswren blood samples collected between 2019 to 2021. The breeding and SNP data was integrated into a population viability analysis, which aims to provide guidance on the translocation of western grasswren from mainland Shark Bay to Dirk Hartog Island. Currently, a manuscript detailing the population genetics of the western grasswren is in review in Ibis, and the manuscript detailing the breeding biology and social organisation of the western grasswren is in review in <em>Emu &ndash; Austral Ornithology</em>. The manuscript investigating the presence and effects of song dialects in western grasswren is in progress.</p>

                                            <p>Plant mortality in restoration programs leads to reduced outcomes for biodiversity and is costly for practitioners. Understanding the drivers of mortality, in particular factors influencing soil water availability, is critical. Wind dynamics play a significant role in drying soils and creating atmospheric deficits whereby plants lose water. In altered systems such as restoration environments, the wind dynamics may be different compared to reference communities, and may impact seedling establishment. This project aims to capture reference wind dynamics of many Western Australian ecosystems including the banksia woodland ecosystem, and compare restoration sites to the reference state. Understanding the critical thresholds for wind dynamics and the impacts on plant physiological performance will be assessed for <em>Banksia</em> species.</p>
<p>This study investigated canopy flow in native Australian vegetation and post-mine restoration systems. These wind flow dynamics were then used to monitor the impact of wind on <em>Banksia attenuata</em> seedling growth and physiology, providing a significant insight into the role of wind as an abiotic factor in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.</p>

                                            <p>According to ecological theory, sympatric species cannot occupy the same niche space. Therefore, the coexistence of sympatric species is thought to be facilitated by the partitioning of resources, differing patterns of habitat utilisation, or both. However, in the tropical savannas of northern Australia 3 sympatric grass finches co-exist. It is thought that the threatened Gouldian finch has a specialised diet of grass seeds and also morphological adaptations for greater dispersal. In contrast, the more common Long-tailed and Masked Finches have a generalist diet, including a greater range of herbaceous seeds and invertebrates, and are also more sedentary in their habitat use and movements. Fire regimes leading to increased movements to locate specialist food resources may increase risks to Gouldian finches, including starvation and/or lost body condition. This study uses stable isotope analysis and novel radio telemetry methods to test hypotheses on diet specialisation, and foraging behaviour in the Kimberley savanna as resource bottlenecks increase as grass seeds become more scarce into the late dry season.</p>
<p>This field work and analyses are complex and the research revealed that sympatric finches have different temporal-spatial waterhole visitation patterns implications for inter-specific accuracy of census data. Gouldian finches were found to increase their broad-scale movements between activity nodes while halving their residence time at nodes consistent with reduced density of seed resources into the late dry season. Sympatric finches also diverged in their feeding and movement niches during the late dry season. Gouldian finches moved more and remained strictly granivorous, while masked and long-tailed finches diversified diet to include more invertebrates and non-grass seeds and remained sedentary. As postulated from previous research, Gouldian finches preferred foraging in early prescribed burnt savanna indicating preference for low intensity mosaics rather than wildfire dominated regimes.</p>

                                            <p>The red-tailed phascogale, <em>Phascogale calura</em>, is listed as conservation-dependent. Due to their highly fragmented and restricted habitat in south-west Western Australia, understanding their genetic structure and diversity is crucial to informed conservation action. This study aims to 1) assess genetic structure across remaining wild reserve populations, 2) assess genetic diversity within reserves, 3) determine the genetic outcome of a previous mixed wild-to-wild translocation to Kojonup reserve, and 4) estimate effective wild global population size.</p>
<p>DArTseq analysis was undertaken for 208 red-tailed phascogale samples. An isolation by distance model best explained the genetic structure, with some evidence of fine scale structure of two northern reserves. Autosomal heterozygosity indicated that diversity is spread uniformly across reserves, and no populations showed signs of inbreeding or strong genetic drift. Although Kojonup has retained the diversity of the wider species, the source populations were unevenly represented. Global effective population size was estimated at 100 individuals in 2021.</p>

This project is investigating the success of translocation in <em>Banksia brownii</em> and <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa</em> and aims to: (1) compare the mating systems and genetic diversity of translocated populations with wild populations (2) determine how reproductive output and progeny performance of translocated populations compares to wild populations and (3) assess the efficacy of using measures of mating system parameters, genetic diversity and reproductive potential to better understand translocation success. The findings have a number of potential implications for not only assessing long term translocation success, but also improving translocation design and establishment technologies.</p>
<p>Analysis has been completed for genetic diversity, mating system analysis, reproductive output and progeny performance data for <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa</em> and methods and results drafted. A journal article on genetic diversity, mating systems, reproductive output and pollination analysis (for one translocated <em>B. brownii</em> population and four wild populations) has been submitted to <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>. Methods and results have been drafted for a third paper on comparison of <em>B. brownii</em> progeny fitness traits from a translocated population with those from wild populations. An introduction and discussion for the <em>Acacia</em> study and <em>Banksia</em> progeny study are currently being drafted.</p>

<p>An extensive review of the literature has been undertaken and a pilot trail completed to test and refine water and beach sampling methods. Three, quarterly sampling events at 38 beach sites and four estuary regions have been completed. Analytical methods for plastic fragment identification are being developed in collaboration with the ChemCentre to analyse the plastic fragments that have been collected.</p>

Modelling of predator responses to fox baiting intensity, prey abundance and rainfall has been undertaken, and the results of this have been submitted to Wildlife Research. State-space models have been used to predict spatial and temporal variation in abundance across the Upper Warren, and then used in structural equation models and scenario analysis to identify drivers of population change, including baiting intensity, fire history and severity, timber harvesting and primary productivity. An additional project has also begun to use multi-species abundance modelling and optimisation analyses to identify optimal fire regimes and fox baiting intensities in the Upper Warren.</p>

                                            <p>Plant physiological condition is a key indicator in the early stages of restoration progress assessment. Current methods to determine condition are difficult to undertake over large areas and are time-consuming. This research project aims to determine if near-surface remote sensing measurements (particularly hyperspectral sensing and thermography) can reliably quantify plant drought stress condition in a biodiverse plant community. Quantitative criteria will be proposed to evaluate restoration success by defining a fast, accurate, and easy to perform methodology, potentially establishing the foundation for scaling up remote imaging platforms that allow monitoring of larger areas in shorter timeframes.</p>
<p>Experiments continued to explore hyperspectral reflectance (measured with a field spectrometer) as a predictor of plant water status, plant water content, pigment content and maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II, as well as leaf temperature (measured through thermal imagery) to predict stomatal conductance. Initially this work was completed in controlled environment facilities and then applied to Banksia woodland restoration sites where five functionally distinct plant species were monitored over 15 months. All experiments are completed and analysis and writing are underway.</p>

                                            <p>The status of local populations of a species must be assessed prior to further supplementary translocations. Brushtail possums were reintroduced to the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area in 2007 under the assumption that the local population was extinct. Concerns were raised about potential bottlenecking of sub-populations of the translocated possums in 2017. This project investigated whether viable genetic material could be collected from brushtail possums in the arid zone via baited tracking tunnels; whether there is ongoing evidence of inbreeding or genetic bottlenecking in the brushtail possum population on Matuwa; and whether the phylogenetics of brushtail possums in the arid zone can be assessed through fecal or hair DNA collected through non-invasive techniques.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, viable DNA could not be extracted from either tracking tunnels or relatively fresh possum scats collected near trees. DNA was extracted from two out of 20 preserved possum skins held by the WA Museum, one from Cranbrook and a second from Bendering. Structure analysis of DNA taken from translocated possums suggests considerable genetic admixture between founder populations has occurred. Principal components analysis suggests that the population at Matuwa is significantly different to animals from Cranbrook.</p>

This project also includes a genetic study to assess the health and population dynamics of the species that will inform its future management and long-term preservation.</p>
<p>The research proposal for this project has been approved and engagement with the Wadandi peoples has been undertaken to share in their knowledge of Kalloora and see the species on country. Wadandi representatives have undertaken a tour of the genetics laboratory, herbarium and seed centre to see where the samples for the project will be processed. Fieldwork to collect leaf samples and herbarium vouchers for the genetic analysis of 22 populations has been completed. DNA has been extracted and sequencing is underway.  </p>

                                            <p>The jarrah (<em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>) and karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>) forests of south-west Western Australia provide a variety of values including timber, wildlife habitat and water. However, as climate changes, issues of forest productivity, tree health and mortality, and water yield need to be addressed. Individual-based modelling (IBM) is an ecological modelling approach that represents individuals within populations or communities, and the interactions between them, with a relatively high level of detail and complexity. This study aims to develop an IBM of tree growth in water limited environments, to parameterise the model for jarrah and karri and to predict the impact of tree thinning on timber production, tree health and mortality and water yield using time series data collected from 1965 and 1992, respectively.</p>
<p>For both species, thinning has a positive impact on growth, with stand growth optimised at intermediate densities (10-20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) over multi-decadal time periods, consistent with findings from previous studies. Thinning also influences allometry of stem diameter with height, ratio of height and diameter, crown width and bark thickness. Two papers on jarrah growth response and a third paper on  modelling growth in karri and marri have been published in <em>Forest Ecology and Management</em>. Another manuscript on karri growth response and  thinning is in review and a final manuscript investigating into the effects of above and below ground competition  in jarrah and karri forests is ready for submission. </p>

                                            <p>This project aims to predict the vulnerability of flatback turtle rookeries on the North West Shelf to increasing sand temperatures, sea level rise and increased storm frequency. It will provide critical information for the management of marine turtles and their rookeries by assessing vulnerability and long-term conservation value of different nesting sites and determine if there is need for human intervention.</p>
<p>All field work is now completed and the project is in the analysis and reporting phase. Two papers have been published including a comprehensive review of the literature and one on the metabolic thresholds of flatbacks turtles. A third has been submitted on the vulnerability of sea turtles nesting to erosion and inundation. The two remaining chapters are being finalised for thesis submission. These two chapters include hindcast and forecast climate change modelling to help understand turtle population changes. A presentation was made at the 40th International Sea Turtle Symposium and this project has produced an innovative collaboration with the UWA School of Engineering combining biological concepts and engineering models.</p>

<p>Preliminary evidence of loss of anti-predator traits has been identified in havened woylies. Two behavioural assays have been developed, one for cage trapping and another for feeding stations. These assays will now be used to compare anti-predator responses in havened and non-havened woylie populations across WA.</p>

Oxidative stress is a primary impediment to successful cryopreservation of plant material, and a better understanding of this will be a crucial step forward in designing more efficient cryopreservation protocols for ex-situ conservation of threatened plant species.</p>
<p>An optimised cryopreservation method for wild type <em>A. thaliana</em> has been developed using vitamin C- and GSH-deficient mutant plants (vtc2-1, vtc2-4, pad2-1 and cad2), to assess changes in transcriptome using RNA-seq. Visualisation of roGFP via confocal microscopy to confirms redox changes in both the wild type and mutant plants after cryopreservation and assessment of antioxidant content during cryopreservation is being progressed.</p>

                                            <p>Issues arising from habitat fragmentation are exacerbated by a warming and drying climate, land use changes and invasive species. To maintain biodiversity, various management methods are employed, such as prescribing burning or herbicide application. Many of these strategies are macro-organism focused, with less attention paid to microorganisms. Soil fungi play instrumental roles in ecosystem functioning, yet in many ecosystems little is known about how soil fungi respond to prescribed burning and weed control. The Swan Coastal Plain&rsquo;s Banksia woodland is one such ecosystem where there is a gap in knowledge. This project will help fill that knowledge gap and better inform management decisions.</p>
<p>Fire has a very complex effect on the soil fungi community in Banksia woodland and results indicate that ecosystem function is maintained throughout a chronosequence of time since fire. Herbicides, seem to alter the soil fungal community, and further investigation is being undertaken.</p>

Microorganisms have been widely reported to be beneficial for agricultural crops for example through growth stimulation, increased nutrient uptake and plant tolerance against abiotic stress such as drought induced by microbial phytohormone and enzyme signals. Some of these beneficial microorganisms are also present in natural soil systems, however, their role in facilitating seedling establishment is yet to be identified. This project aims to investigate if microorganisms known to benefit agricultural species can be applied to Western Australian natural systems via inoculations. The project also aims to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the positive effects of microorganisms on plants and explore how these findings can be integrated to improve mine site restoration strategies.</span></p>
<p>The results of the project demonstrated rather limited beneficial effects of the selected microbial inoculants on the tested native plant species and highlights that further research is required before advocating the use of commercial microbial inoculant in post-mining ecological restoration. The work also provided an approach to evaluate the use of commercial microbial inoculants through method development and experimental approaches that will be useful for future research.</p>

                                            <p>Robust population estimates are fundamental to species conservation and management. This project aims to use lured remote sensor cameras and spatially explicit capture recapture modelling to improve the accuracy of density and abundance estimates for chuditch populations.</p>
<p>Appropriate sampling design including trap number, spacing and survey duration is being informed using existing camera trap data from the Upper Warren (Moopinup and Balban). A camera model comparison trial was conducted using lured paired Reconyx and Swift cameras in four positions (single and paired traps horizontally oriented and set 3 mm above ground and angled traps set 1 m and 2 m above ground) at 12 locations within Julimar State Forest. Cameras were deployed for 6 weeks. Image processing and data analysis are underway to determine the best configuration and model. The results from these two studies will be used to produce a reliable and sensitive density estimate of chuditch, firstly at Julimar and then for other important chuditch populations across the species' range.</p>

                                            <p>Salt lakes are a distinctive feature of Western Australian inland areas. Several invertebrate groups appear to be far more diverse in Western Australia than anywhere else in Australia and even globally, probably reflecting the long history of aridification and the now disjunct occurrence of this type of wetland in the State. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing (especially in the Wheatbelt) and increasingly, by mining on or near the lake bed. The first goal of the project is to use mitochondrial DNA data and, if necessary, nuclear DNA data, to assess the validity of the morpho-taxonomy of genus Australocypris, which is one of the most diverse genera in Australian salt lakes. The second goal is to use molecular data to test alternative hypotheses about species radiations in Australocypris, whose evolutionary history is largely unknown. The final goal is to develop a protocol for hatching and raising adult ostracods from resting eggs in mud samples collected from dry lakes, as a substitute for collecting active ostracods.</p>
<p>A review of giant ostracod ecology and biology was submitted to Marine and Freshwater Research. Data for the second chapter on the taxonomy of Mytilocypridinae giant ostracods have been analysed, and a draft of the associated article completed. Analyses of the phylogeography and evolutionary history of <em>Australocypris </em>ostracods are complete and drafting this chapter has commenced. Most experiments for experimental analysis of hatching conditions are complete and analyses are underway, and sediment/egg samples have been collected for a final experiment.</p>

                                            <p>Australia has many salt lakes that support a diverse range of invertebrates. Crustaceans are particularly dominant and many species, genera, and even some families are endemic to these environments. The brine shrimp genus <em>Parartemia</em> is a good example, being one of the most diverse, common, and salt-tolerant groups of invertebrates that only occurs in Australian salt lakes. This research focuses on this endemic brine shrimp genus, with three main aims: 1) to use mitochondrial DNA data and, if necessary, also nuclear data, to assess the validity of the current morpho-taxonomy, 2) use molecular data to understand the evolutionary history of <em>Parartemia</em>, and 3) investigate the population genetic structure of <em>P. longicaudata</em> considering its conservation importance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A paper reviewing <em>Parartemia</em> literature has been developed. One hundred and two populations of <em>Parartemia</em> from Western Australia have been collected so far and these have been identified based on the current morpho-taxonomy. A total of 102 16S (~ 477 bp), 206 COI (658 bp), and 47 28S (~ 868 bp) sequences have been generated which comprised a total of 88 16S, 141 COI, and 25 28S haplotypes. All these sequences represented 16 previously described morpho-species (out of 18) and 2 new species. The first draft of the molecular taxonomy article has been developed. These data are being used to determine the evolutionary history of the species, and a draft is underway for another article. An additional 200 COI (658 bp) sequences of <em>P. longicaudata</em> have been generated for the population genetic structure and phylogeographic study, data analysis is ongoing for this chapter.</p>

                                            <p>Salt lakes are an iconic feature of Western Australian semi-arid and arid landscapes, with a flora and fauna that have adapted and diversified within these extreme environments. Western Australia has a very diverse halophilic fauna, higher than anywhere else in Australia. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing (especially in the Wheatbelt) and increasingly, by mining on or near the lake bed. One of the most intriguing invertebrate groups is the snail genus <em>Coxiella</em>, which tolerates both periodic drying and high salinities and is the only mollusc occurring in temporarily filled salt lakes. This project focusses on the taxonomy, ecology and evolutionary history of this genus.</p>
<p>A taxonomic assessment of <em>Coxiella</em> has been completed which identified a total of 14 species, with six considered to be new species indicating that the diversity of this group has been underestimated. The taxonomic study also included a South-African genus <em>Tomichia </em>to test the hypothesis that these genera were once a Gondwanan assemblage. The genetic analyses found that <em>Coxiella </em>and <em>Tomichia </em>formed a monophyletic clade relative to outgroup taxa suggesting an ancient relationship between these genera. Physiological experiments on the salinity tolerances of 6 <em>Coxiella </em>species were also undertaken. The results suggested that although all <em>Coxiella </em>species can persist across a wide range of salinities (~5 &ndash; 70 mS/cm) some species are much more tolerant of higher salinities than others. <em>Coxiella </em>n. sp 2 in particular was able to tolerate salinities of ~ 135 mS/cm without displaying significant levels of mortality, suggesting that this species may be one of the most salt tolerant gastropods globally.</p>

                                            <p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is listed as critically endangered. The species occurs in only two natural populations at very low numbers. Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught tortoises is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Following a review of the diet of the captive-breeding colony of western swamp tortoises, a second manufactured diet based on white-fleshed fish was developed to address concerns about low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the 'traditional' red meat diet. For four years, approximately half the tortoises in the colony have been maintained on the original red-meat based diet and half on the white-fleshed fish diet. The project will determine whether there are any significant differences between the diets in hatchling and juvenile growth rates, weight loss associated with aestivation and female reproductive output (as determined by clutch size, egg mass and hatchling mass). </p>

                                            <p>Mining companies have a legal responsibility to return native biota to post-mining environments; although ecological restoration is challenging, especially in water limited environments. The chemical and physical properties of substrates do not always explain high seedling mortality therefore other factors such as drought should be explored. This research project aims to improve restoration outcomes by obtaining a greater understanding of the influence of soil water availability and phenotypic plasticity on juvenile plant morphology, physiology and survival in the post iron ore mining environments of semi-arid Western Australia.</p>
<p>All experimental work has been completed including research to (1) understand germination thresholds of semi-arid restoration priority species (2) investigate how preconditioning seedlings to water stress influences tolerance to subsequent drought in restoration substrates and (3) understand how propagule type, substrate and water availability influence establishment in restoration environments. Analysis and writing is underway.</p>

                                            <p>The northern quoll (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) is a nocturnal mesopredator threatened by habitat loss due to mining in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and the impacts of mining on the movement and behaviour of northern quolls are poorly known. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap and identify the movement and behaviour of northern quolls living in mining landscapes.</p>
<p>Ten individuals from two separate field seasons have been tracked in mining landscapes using GPS technology. The next step will be to undertake GPS tracking at a natural reference site with no mining to compare the movement of northern quolls between the two areas. Quantifying predator abundances around mine camps compared to ecologically similar natural areas is currently being completed. The first chapter is currently in review and investigates the habitat use of northern quolls using historical datasets.</p>

<p>Data from a camera trap survey in two areas in the Upper Warren region were processed and analysis is underway. This survey allows comparison between two camera types (Swift 3C wide angle and Reconyx HC600/PC900).  Preliminary results suggest that Swift cameras had higher detection rates than Reconyx cameras, and that numbat density between the two sites is estimated to be 0.018 per ha. GPS collar data was collected for a further nine numbats resulting in a total of 18 GPS data sets from 15 numbats (13 females and 2 males). Preliminary analysis suggests home ranges vary between 11 and 280 ha. Ground level habitat data was also collected from 120 plots to compare high use areas to available habitat. These data will be combined to investigate habitat use and whether this varies by season.</p>

                                            <p>Seagrass communities are under threat at a global scale, yet molecular physiological responses of seagrass to key stressors &ndash; such as eutrophication and sediment stress - remains largely unknown. The central aim of this project is to investigate cellular stress responses of the key seagrass species <em>Halophila ovalis</em> in the Swan Canning Estuary on a seasonal scale using novel molecular biomarker techniques such as metabolomics.</p>
<p>Metabolomic studies of <em>H. ovalis</em> have been conducted in both field and controlled laboratory environments in order to identify potential &lsquo;early warning bioindicators&rsquo; of nutrient loading, sediment sulfides and other stressors. Findings of the field component have be submitted to the journal <em>Ecological Indicators</em>. Thesis writing is currently underway.</p>

Specifically, the program promotes and undertakes marine research and monitoring to improve the scientific basis for the conservation and management of Western Australia&#x27;s State-wide system of marine protected areas, threatened marine fauna and marine biodiversity generally. The program also coordinates and manages external marine research programs, such as the current investigation into the bio-physical, social and cultural values of the Kimberley that is undertaken as part of the Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI). The research and monitoring programs undertaken by the Marine Science Program are based around the research and monitoring strategies identified in protected area management plans and threatened species recovery and management plans, ensuring that all activities are linked to departmental priorities and programs.&quot;, &#x27;image&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 4, &#x27;file&#x27;: &#x27;/files/business_areas/IMG_3795_resize.jpg&#x27;}, &#x27;leader&#x27;: 36, &#x27;finance_admin&#x27;: 36, &#x27;data_custodian&#x27;: 36, &#x27;is_active&#x27;: True}, &#x27;image&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 378, &#x27;file&#x27;: &#x27;/files/projects/health.jpg&#x27;, &#x27;project&#x27;: {&#x27;id&#x27;: 630, &#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;(DUPLICATE 1) &lt;p&gt;The health status of marine turtles in northern and western Australia&lt;/p&gt;&#x27;}, &#x27;uploader&#x27;: {&#x27;id&#x27;: 101073, &#x27;username&#x27;: &#x27;jarid.prince@dbca.wa.gov.au&#x27;}}, &#x27;student_level&#x27;: &#x27;phd&#x27;}, &#x27;project_lead_approval_granted&#x27;: True, &#x27;business_area_lead_approval_granted&#x27;: True, &#x27;directorate_approval_granted&#x27;: True, &#x27;pdf&#x27;: None, &#x27;pdf_generation_in_progress&#x27;: False}, &#x27;report&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 9, &#x27;year&#x27;: 2022, &#x27;creator&#x27;: 895, &#x27;date_open&#x27;: &#x27;2022-07-01&#x27;, &#x27;date_closed&#x27;: &#x27;2022-07-30&#x27;, &#x27;media&#x27;: [], &#x27;pdf&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 4, &#x27;file&#x27;: &#x27;/files/annual_reports/pdfs/_Annual_Report_9.pdf&#x27;, &#x27;report&#x27;: {&#x27;id&#x27;: 9, &#x27;year&#x27;: 2022}}, &#x27;pdf_generation_in_progress&#x27;: True}, &#x27;year&#x27;: 2022, &#x27;progress_report&#x27;: &#x27;&lt;p&gt;This project aims to assess the health and disease status of sea turtles in Western Australia, with a focus on flatback turtles. For stranded dead and injured turtles, pathology is used to diagnose the causes of death and injury, with parasite infections and fibropapilloma virus being specifically investigated. For healthy turtles the project has established a blood chemistry reference baseline which can be used nationally by turtle care facilities.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The outcomes of this project included the first health assessment of sea turtles in Western Australia, including blood chemistry and reference baselines for nesting and in-water flatback turtles. Processes for pathology and pathology descriptions for flatback turtles were developed and personnel across the state were trained. Knowledge transfer to stakeholders included support for the banning of mass balloon releases in WA. A novel disease related to a multiple species mortality event in Broome (fish kill) was identified, as were a new parasite and haemoparasites in flatback turtles. A paper has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Diseases of Aquatic Organisms&lt;/em&gt;, three draft manuscripts are in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&#x27;, &#x27;team_members&#x27;: [{&#x27;user&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 1015, &#x27;first_name&#x27;: &#x27;Kristin&#x27;, &#x27;last_name&#x27;: &#x27;Warren&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;: &#x27;unset_483@email.com&#x27;, &#x27;is_active&#x27;: True, &#x27;is_staff&#x27;: False, &#x27;title&#x27;: None}, &#x27;project&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 630, &#x27;kind&#x27;: &#x27;student&#x27;}, &#x27;role&#x27;: &#x27;academicsuper&#x27;, &#x27;is_leader&#x27;: False, &#x27;position&#x27;: 100}, {&#x27;user&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 187, &#x27;first_name&#x27;: &#x27;Lian&#x27;, &#x27;last_name&#x27;: &#x27;Yeap&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;: &#x27;unset_92@email.com&#x27;, &#x27;is_active&#x27;: True, &#x27;is_staff&#x27;: False, &#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Dr&#x27;}, &#x27;project&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 630, &#x27;kind&#x27;: &#x27;student&#x27;}, &#x27;role&#x27;: &#x27;academicsuper&#x27;, &#x27;is_leader&#x27;: False, &#x27;position&#x27;: 100}, {&#x27;user&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 976, &#x27;first_name&#x27;: &#x27;Rebecca&#x27;, &#x27;last_name&#x27;: &#x27;Vaughan-Higgins&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;: &#x27;unset_461@email.com&#x27;, &#x27;is_active&#x27;: True, &#x27;is_staff&#x27;: False, &#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Dr&#x27;}, &#x27;project&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 630, &#x27;kind&#x27;: &#x27;student&#x27;}, &#x27;role&#x27;: &#x27;academicsuper&#x27;, &#x27;is_leader&#x27;: False, &#x27;position&#x27;: 100}, {&#x27;user&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 946, &#x27;first_name&#x27;: &#x27;Erina&#x27;, &#x27;last_name&#x27;: &#x27;Young&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;: &#x27;unset_445@email.com&#x27;, &#x27;is_active&#x27;: True, &#x27;is_staff&#x27;: False, &#x27;title&#x27;: None}, &#x27;project&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 630, &#x27;kind&#x27;: &#x27;student&#x27;}, &#x27;role&#x27;: &#x27;student&#x27;, &#x27;is_leader&#x27;: False, &#x27;position&#x27;: 100}, {&#x27;user&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 875, &#x27;first_name&#x27;: &#x27;Nahiid&#x27;, &#x27;last_name&#x27;: &#x27;Stephens&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;: &#x27;unset_419@email.com&#x27;, &#x27;is_active&#x27;: True, &#x27;is_staff&#x27;: False, &#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Dr&#x27;}, &#x27;project&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 630, &#x27;kind&#x27;: &#x27;student&#x27;}, &#x27;role&#x27;: &#x27;academicsuper&#x27;, &#x27;is_leader&#x27;: False, &#x27;position&#x27;: 100}, {&#x27;user&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 272, &#x27;first_name&#x27;: &#x27;Scott&#x27;, &#x27;last_name&#x27;: &#x27;Whiting&#x27;, &#x27;email&#x27;: &#x27;scott.whiting@dbca.wa.gov.au&#x27;, &#x27;is_active&#x27;: True, &#x27;is_staff&#x27;: True, &#x27;title&#x27;: &#x27;Dr&#x27;}, &#x27;project&#x27;: {&#x27;pk&#x27;: 630, &#x27;kind&#x27;: &#x27;student&#x27;}, &#x27;role&#x27;: &#x27;supervising&#x27;, &#x27;is_leader&#x27;: True, &#x27;position&#x27;: 1}], &#x27;project_areas&#x27;: ProjectAreaSerializer(&lt;ProjectArea: (STUDENT) (DUPLICATE 1) The health status of marine turtles in northern and western Australia - 81, 82, 86, 87&gt;):
