15,CHAA,alexc,9,,Alex,R.,Chapman,en,92199060,0,alex.chapman@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>Alex Chapman is a Research Associate at the <a href=""http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/our-environment/science-and-research/wa-herbarium.html"" target=""external"">Western Australian Herbarium</a> in DPaW’s Science and Conservation Division. His long-term systematic research interests are in the Australian heaths -&nbsp;Ericaceae&nbsp;subfamily Styphelioideae. Over the years Alex has worked on the circumscription and systematic relationships within the largest genus <i>Leucopogon</i>, as well as the southern genus <i>Monotoca</i> and, most recently,&nbsp;the WA representatives of the genus <i>Melichrus</i>.</p>

<p>Previously, with a small but dedicated team, Alex managed much of the content and ongoing development of <a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/"" target=""external"">FloraBase - the Western Australian Flora</a>, the primary portal for authoritative botanical information on the State's flora. He is a past editor of WA’s journal of systematic botany - <i><a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/nuytsia/"" target=""external""> Nuytsia</a></i> and remains an active member of the journal's editorial committee and he has lectured in biodiversity informatics for the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sons.ecu.edu.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">School of Natural Sciences</a>&nbsp;at Edith Cowan University.</p>

<p>Alex has been invited to international meetings to speak on aspects of building a global plant systematics information network and has presented lectures in Edinburgh, Dublin, London, Paris, St. Petersburg, Washington and Florida on the bioinformatics work of the Western Australian Herbarium and the Australian botanical community. During 1998-99 he held the position as 42nd <a href=""http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/funding-and-research/ablo/index.html"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Australian Botanical Liaison Officer (ABLO)</a> at the Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in London. He has represented the WA Herbarium at the Nomenclature Section of two International Botanical Conferences (St. Louis, 1999 and Vienna, 2005).</p>

<p>Alex maintains a deep interest in bioinformatics as it applies to taxonomy - between 2002 and 2008 he was the Oceania representative of the <a href=""http://www.tdwg.org/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG)</a> and as a member of the executive committee participated in a number of international meeting during that time. With colleagues he planned and organised TDWG annual general meeting of over 200 delegates in Fremantle during October 2008. He is an inaugural member of the <a href=""http://hiscom.chah.org.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Herbarium Information Systems Committee</a> (HISCOM), a working group of the <a href=""http://www.chah.org.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria</a> (CHAH). Recently, he has advised on the work of the <a href=""http://ala.org.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Atlas of Living Australia</a> (ALA).</p>

<p>From May 1990 to January 2014 he was employed as a Research Scientist at the Western Australian Herbarium where his research focused on the development of corporate botanical information systems. In 1998 this work culminated in the launch of the&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dec.wa.gov.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">FloraBase - the Western Australian Flora</a>. In 2000 he co-authored&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/publications/descat/"" target=""external"">The Western Australian flora - a descriptive catalogue</a>&nbsp;comprising short codified taxonomic descriptions for every taxon then known to occur in WA, which simultaneously provided content for the taxon profiles within FloraBase and a&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/search/advanced"" target=""external"">simple but comprehensive identification tool</a>.</p>

<p>Alex studied botany and biochemistry at the University of New England and subsequently at Sydney University whilst working at the <a href=""http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/science/Plant_Diversity_Research"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">National Herbarium of New South Wales</a> on the systematics of <i>Leucopogon</i> (Epacridaceae) as part of the Flora of Australia project. On moving to Perth in 1987 he worked on the genus <i>Acacia</i> (Fabaceae : Mimosoideae), focusing on the systematics of the <i>Acacia bivenosa</i> group and the preparation of detailed species descriptions, now published in two volumes of the <a href=""http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/flora-of-australia/vol11.html"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Flora of Australia</a> series.

134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>i) Honours thesis:</p>

<p>Utilization of habitat by two species of honeyeaters (Aves: Meliphagidae). This research described how the distribution and beak morphology of two species of honeyeaters were correlated with the types of flowers available and used. The project was supervised by Dr HF Recher.</p>

<p>ii) PhD thesis:</p>

<p><i>The ecology and evolution of passerine birds on islands.</i> In six sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Coexistence of congeneric species in island and mainland avifaunas.</li>
	<li>Diversity of bird populations in <i>Eucalyptus </i>forests on islands and mainland.</li>

	<li>Variation in various passerine species in Australia: simultaneous examination of six characters.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation in <i>Geospiza</i> species in the Galápagos Islands.</li>
</ol>

<p>iii) Postdoctoral Fellowship, McGill University:</p>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>Other activities</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 1998, I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1998 I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1999 I presented a paper on the role of ecological and evolutionary principles in ecologically sustainable forest management at a conference on ecological theory held at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In 2000 I presented a paper at a Scientists for Sustainability colloquium held at Batemans Bay and at Canberra.</p>

<p>In 2002 I presented a paper on Aboriginal burning in south-west Western Australia at a conference on fire held in Perth.</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1
134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1
134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1
134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>iii) Postdoctoral Fellowship, McGill University:</p>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>Other activities</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 1998, I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1998 I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1999 I presented a paper on the role of ecological and evolutionary principles in ecologically sustainable forest management at a conference on ecological theory held at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In 2000 I presented a paper at a Scientists for Sustainability colloquium held at Batemans Bay and at Canberra.</p>

<p>In 2002 I presented a paper on Aboriginal burning in south-west Western Australia at a conference on fire held in Perth.</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1
134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>iii) Postdoctoral Fellowship, McGill University:</p>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>Other activities</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 1998, I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1998 I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1999 I presented a paper on the role of ecological and evolutionary principles in ecologically sustainable forest management at a conference on ecological theory held at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In 2000 I presented a paper at a Scientists for Sustainability colloquium held at Batemans Bay and at Canberra.</p>

<p>In 2002 I presented a paper on Aboriginal burning in south-west Western Australia at a conference on fire held in Perth.</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1
134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>Utilization of habitat by two species of honeyeaters (Aves: Meliphagidae). This research described how the distribution and beak morphology of two species of honeyeaters were correlated with the types of flowers available and used. The project was supervised by Dr HF Recher.</p>

<p>ii) PhD thesis:</p>

<p><i>The ecology and evolution of passerine birds on islands.</i> In six sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Coexistence of congeneric species in island and mainland avifaunas.</li>
	<li>Diversity of bird populations in <i>Eucalyptus </i>forests on islands and mainland.</li>

	<li>Variation in various passerine species in Australia: simultaneous examination of six characters.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation in <i>Geospiza</i> species in the Galápagos Islands.</li>
</ol>

<p>iii) Postdoctoral Fellowship, McGill University:</p>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>Other activities</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 1998, I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1998 I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1999 I presented a paper on the role of ecological and evolutionary principles in ecologically sustainable forest management at a conference on ecological theory held at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In 2000 I presented a paper at a Scientists for Sustainability colloquium held at Batemans Bay and at Canberra.</p>

<p>In 2002 I presented a paper on Aboriginal burning in south-west Western Australia at a conference on fire held in Perth.</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1
134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>iii) Postdoctoral Fellowship, McGill University:</p>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>Other activities</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 1998, I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1998 I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1999 I presented a paper on the role of ecological and evolutionary principles in ecologically sustainable forest management at a conference on ecological theory held at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In 2000 I presented a paper at a Scientists for Sustainability colloquium held at Batemans Bay and at Canberra.</p>

<p>In 2002 I presented a paper on Aboriginal burning in south-west Western Australia at a conference on fire held in Perth.</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1

<p>From May 1990 to January 2014 he was employed as a Research Scientist at the Western Australian Herbarium where his research focused on the development of corporate botanical information systems. In 1998 this work culminated in the launch of the&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dec.wa.gov.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">FloraBase - the Western Australian Flora</a>. In 2000 he co-authored&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/publications/descat/"" target=""external"">The Western Australian flora - a descriptive catalogue</a>&nbsp;comprising short codified taxonomic descriptions for every taxon then known to occur in WA, which simultaneously provided content for the taxon profiles within FloraBase and a&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/search/advanced"" target=""external"">simple but comprehensive identification tool</a>.</p>

134,ABBI,iana,12,Dr,Ian,,Abbott,en,93340526,93340135,ian.abbott@dpaw.wa.gov.au,"<p>When at school I can recall being very much stimulated by the scientific activities of Galileo and Torricelli and the idea that the pursuit of “Truth” was a worthwhile way to spend one’s life. I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

<p>i) Honours thesis:</p>

<p>Utilization of habitat by two species of honeyeaters (Aves: Meliphagidae). This research described how the distribution and beak morphology of two species of honeyeaters were correlated with the types of flowers available and used. The project was supervised by Dr HF Recher.</p>

<p>ii) PhD thesis:</p>

<p><i>The ecology and evolution of passerine birds on islands.</i> In six sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Coexistence of congeneric species in island and mainland avifaunas.</li>
	<li>Diversity of bird populations in <i>Eucalyptus </i>forests on islands and mainland.</li>

	<li>Variation in various passerine species in Australia: simultaneous examination of six characters.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation in <i>Geospiza</i> species in the Galápagos Islands.</li>
</ol>

<p>iii) Postdoctoral Fellowship, McGill University:</p>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>Other activities</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 1998, I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1998 I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1999 I presented a paper on the role of ecological and evolutionary principles in ecologically sustainable forest management at a conference on ecological theory held at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In 2000 I presented a paper at a Scientists for Sustainability colloquium held at Batemans Bay and at Canberra.</p>

<p>In 2002 I presented a paper on Aboriginal burning in south-west Western Australia at a conference on fire held in Perth.</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>",,,,1
