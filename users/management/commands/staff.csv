<p>The current research programs are focused on the design and development of introduced predator control strategies, over broad-scale areas, to provide an effective, cost-efficient long-term sustained control solution. As part of this program, I am also involved in the development of techniques to monitor introduced predator abundance that will enable the planning and implementation of clearly defined prescriptions for introduced predator control (including baiting requirements; ie. where, when and how to bait), and, importantly, will allow an objective assessment of the effectiveness of control measures in reducing their density.</p>","<p>I have extensive experience and expertise in the fields of fox and feral cat ecology and control strategies. I have made a significant contribution to the design and development of effective and cost-efficient control strategies for both foxes and feral cats, including innovative research into determining the timing of baiting programs to maximize efficiency; determining baiting efficiency across geographic zones; examining levels of baiting intensity to provide cost effective control; and assessing potential non-target risks. In addition to this research, I have been involved in designing and developing techniques to survey populations and assess various aspects of population demographics relevant to control strategies. This research has led to a number of major achievements and been instrumental in the Department being recognized as the leading agency in Australia in introduced predator control strategies.</p>","<p>ACADEMIC QUALIFICATIONS / PROFESSIONAL TRAINING</p>

From 1977 to 1988 I worked on the development of fire behaviour models and fire danger rating systems for Pinus radiata plantations and jarrah forests. I also studied some impacts of fire in these ecosystems and was involved with several biological surveys in southern forests and woodlands. I was the Manjimup Research Centre Manager from 1983-1988. I transferred to Perth in 1988. From the Woodvale and Como Research Centres, I continued to investigate aspects of fire ecology in banksia woodlands, wandoo woodlands and jarrah forests. I commenced studies of fire regimes and fire behaviour in hummock grasslands which culminated in a first version fire behaviour guide and operational aerial patch-burning in arid zone nature reserves. I worked on an experimental fauna reintroduction project in the Gibson Desert Nature Reserve and later on a large scale fauna reconstruction project on the Peron Peninsula. In 1994 I completed a PhD on modelling the behaviour and impacts of fire in jarrah forests. During my career as a research scientist, I have been assisted at various times by Bob Voutier, Bob Smith, Alex Robinson, Bruce Ward and Karen Maisey.</p>

His long-term systematic research interests are in the Australian heaths -&nbsp;Ericaceae&nbsp;subfamily Styphelioideae. Over the years Alex has worked on the circumscription and systematic relationships within the largest genus <i>Leucopogon</i>, as well as the southern genus <i>Monotoca</i> and, most recently,&nbsp;the WA representatives of the genus <i>Melichrus</i>.</p>

<p>Previously, with a small but dedicated team, Alex managed much of the content and ongoing development of <a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/"" target=""external"">FloraBase - the Western Australian Flora</a>, the primary portal for authoritative botanical information on the State's flora. He is a past editor of WA’s journal of systematic botany - <i><a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/nuytsia/"" target=""external""> Nuytsia</a></i> and remains an active member of the journal's editorial committee and he has lectured in biodiversity informatics for the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sons.ecu.edu.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">School of Natural Sciences</a>&nbsp;at Edith Cowan University.</p>

<p>Alex has been invited to international meetings to speak on aspects of building a global plant systematics information network and has presented lectures in Edinburgh, Dublin, London, Paris, St. Petersburg, Washington and Florida on the bioinformatics work of the Western Australian Herbarium and the Australian botanical community. During 1998-99 he held the position as 42nd <a href=""http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/funding-and-research/ablo/index.html"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Australian Botanical Liaison Officer (ABLO)</a> at the Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in London. He has represented the WA Herbarium at the Nomenclature Section of two International Botanical Conferences (St. Louis, 1999 and Vienna, 2005).</p>

<p>Alex maintains a deep interest in bioinformatics as it applies to taxonomy - between 2002 and 2008 he was the Oceania representative of the <a href=""http://www.tdwg.org/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG)</a> and as a member of the executive committee participated in a number of international meeting during that time. With colleagues he planned and organised TDWG annual general meeting of over 200 delegates in Fremantle during October 2008. He is an inaugural member of the <a href=""http://hiscom.chah.org.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Herbarium Information Systems Committee</a> (HISCOM), a working group of the <a href=""http://www.chah.org.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria</a> (CHAH). Recently, he has advised on the work of the <a href=""http://ala.org.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Atlas of Living Australia</a> (ALA).</p>

<p>From May 1990 to January 2014 he was employed as a Research Scientist at the Western Australian Herbarium where his research focused on the development of corporate botanical information systems. In 1998 this work culminated in the launch of the&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dec.wa.gov.au/"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">FloraBase - the Western Australian Flora</a>. In 2000 he co-authored&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/publications/descat/"" target=""external"">The Western Australian flora - a descriptive catalogue</a>&nbsp;comprising short codified taxonomic descriptions for every taxon then known to occur in WA, which simultaneously provided content for the taxon profiles within FloraBase and a&nbsp;<a href=""http://florabase.dpaw.wa.gov.au/search/advanced"" target=""external"">simple but comprehensive identification tool</a>.</p>

<p>Alex studied botany and biochemistry at the University of New England and subsequently at Sydney University whilst working at the <a href=""http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/science/Plant_Diversity_Research"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">National Herbarium of New South Wales</a> on the systematics of <i>Leucopogon</i> (Epacridaceae) as part of the Flora of Australia project. On moving to Perth in 1987 he worked on the genus <i>Acacia</i> (Fabaceae : Mimosoideae), focusing on the systematics of the <i>Acacia bivenosa</i> group and the preparation of detailed species descriptions, now published in two volumes of the <a href=""http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/flora-of-australia/vol11.html"" onclick=""doit();"" target=""external"">Flora of Australia</a> series.

I have a particular interest in the Banded Stilt since observing their nesting events at lakes Ballard and Marmion in 1995 when these lakes were filled by Cyclone Bobby. I continue to monitor Banded Stilt movements throughout the state and record sightings of birds that were flagged and ringed from this breeding event.

<p><strong>Research Experience</strong></p>

<p>I am currently a Principal Research Scientist (Information) and manager of the Science Applications Unit within DPaW’s Science and Conservation Division. I have been with DPaW since 1981 (then the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife). I was initially contracted for three years by Dr&nbsp;Stephen&nbsp;Hopper to develop a species distribution plotting program, one of an early breed of geographic information systems (GIS). I subsequently became a permanent Computer Systems Officer, supporting field biologists in data management. In 1987 I moved sideways for computer support per se to the science stream, first as a Research Scientist, then Senior Research Scientist, and now Principal Research Scientist. My first fifteen years were centred in a field-biology work environment, the next seven within the WA Herbarium, and the&nbsp;remainder focusing on divisional- and departmental-wide biodiversity information management.&nbsp;This reflects, over a thirty year period, a gradual migration away from information technology to a passion for a) conservation and b) supporting the whole biodiversity information life cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Spatial analysis</strong><br>
GIS has always been a primary interest of mine, as a tool for research and land management. This interest was spurred in 1983 with a secondment to the SIG Rural Joint Project on the applications of GIS within a rural context - one of the first projects of its kind in WA. That interest culminated in the completion of a Post Graduate Diploma in Science (Geography) at UWA in 1996, with my thesis focusing on the applications of GIS in catchment management and sustainable land-use principles.</p>

<p>Later, with the start of the&nbsp;Western Australian Regional Forest Assessment in 1997, I became interested in the use and application of environmental modeling tools such as BIOCLIM and SpModel for predicting species distribution. The project resulted in the predicted distribution of over 1400 vascular plant species within the RFA project area, one of the comprehensive achievements of it kind in Australia at the time. This work was subsequently published in the Journal of Biogeography (Gioia &amp; Piggot, 2000).</p>

<p>Over the last decade I have been working with Professor&nbsp;Hopper exploring patterns of plant diversity within Western Australia. Early results were published in 2004, describing plant species richness and endemism for the south-west, as well as proposing a new bioregionalisation based on floristic data (Hopper and Gioia, 2004). We are currently updating this research by comparing herbarium datasets 10 years apart, investigating the effects of sampling effort on revealed patterns and recalculating the biodiversity indices and regionalisation.</p>

<p><strong>Data management</strong><br>
Biodiversity data presents a number of challenges to traditional relational database development and management. Over thirty years I've gained a detailed knowledge of the information life cycle within both systematic survey and collections management environments, at both a project level and within an institutional framework. Both envirnoments present different challenges, in particular the management of unstructured, evolving data, and a key area of specialisation: the handling of taxonomic nomenclature. As new knowledge comes to hand our understanding of biological entities within nature changes, resulting in new taxon concepts and new names. This, combined with a comparatively cumbersome Linnaean structure (though, of course, in Linnaeus' time it was a substantial&nbsp; improvement), presents many potential pitfalls in creating a supportive IT environment for scientific research, conservation planning and environmental impact assessment.</p>

<p>A key strategy in navigating these pitfalls was to create a species name management system that accomodated standard taxonomic workflow while addressing user needs for accessibility and functionality. Together with Alex Chapman and WA Herbarium staff, I designed a data model suitable for supporting complex data rules. I then developed and implemented <strong>WACensus</strong>, an Oracle-based system for managing both plant and animal names. This system has become the pediment for many related biodiversity information systems within DPaW and externally. WACensus, together with a number of data protocols, has been at the forefront of like systems within Australia for nearly 20 years.</p>

<p>To support the workflow associated with species data collection and management, I have also developed tools to support field data collection and the management of names data. Most recently, I've supervised the development of <a href=""http://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/max"">Max</a>, a Microsoft Windows application that incorporates a plant specimen electronic collecting book, and name checking facility. While better tools are being developed that will be available over the next few years, Max is still one of the most widely used tool for this purpose within Western Australia.</p>

<p><strong>Consulting and advice</strong><br>
I have been employed as an information consultant on various occasions, including the Queensland Herbarium and the State Herbarium of South Australia, to advise on strategic planning for their herbarium information systems. I have also represented the department and provided expert advice on numerous occasions, at both state and federal levels. Recent representation includes membership of Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) Ecoinformatics Facility Data Providors Reference Group. Previous membership includes executive level IM governance commitees.</p>

<p><strong>A strategic framework for biodiversity information management</strong><br>
Working within a conservation agency prompted the development of a more holistic framework for biodiversity information management (IM). In 2005 I conducted a study tour of five sister agencies within eastern Australia, to compare approaches. The resultant report (Gioia, 2005) made a number of recommendations to DEC Corporate Executive, calling for a radical shift in how IM skills, infrastructure and governance were implemented. This report was a crucial step in the subsequent implementation of a department-wide enterprise architecture process, which resulted in a review and transformation of existing IM governance and processes. In 2007 I developed these ideas further within the context of climate change and the need for access to longitudinal datasets, and the role institutional processes and personal attitudes to data management played in either hindering or promoting access to suitable data (Gioia, 2007).</p>

<p><strong>Biodiversity Portals</strong><br>
In response to a historical lack of access to biodiversity data collected within the agency (both internally and externally), I prototyped and subsequently implemented <a href=""http://naturemap.dec.wa.gov.au"">NatureMap</a>, an award-winning web portal targeted towards industry, consultants, conservation planners, researchers, community groups and the general public. NatureMap is a collaborative project with the Western Australian Museum (WAM), and warehouses the majority of major species biodiversity datasets within DPaW and WAM. There are current over 1500 registered users, with the largest proportion comprising industry and consultants.</p>

<p>While other excellent online resources like the Atlas of Living Australia (<a href=""http://www.ala.org.au"">ALA)</a> have subsequently become available with the assistance of considerable federal funding, NatureMap still provides the most comprehensive resource available on WA biodiversity.</p>","<ul>

<h4>Employment History</h4>

<div><strong>Agricultural Scientist (Botanist), National Herbarium of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, January 1971&nbsp;— August 1977.</strong></div>

<p><strong>Research Scientist—Principal Research Scientist, Western Australian Herbarium,&nbsp;September 1977&nbsp;December 2013&nbsp;.</strong></p>

<p><i>General.</i> Initially, my responsibilities in this position were entirely in an advisory capacity and comprised the authoritative identification of plant material submitted by staff of the Department of Agriculture as well as by scientists in other disciplines. In addition, I handled public enquiries of a more general botanical nature including forensic work and requests for advice on weedy potential, toxicity, distribution, economic importance and natural history associated with native, alien and cultivated plant species. During this period I gave public talks and lectures to various organizations concerning plant taxonomic subjects; this included several extended lecture courses.</p>

<p><i>Research.</i> From January 1981 I was encouraged to shift the emphasis of my work to research aspects of botany. Since then, my work has emphasised taxonomic research and consequent publication, consisting of articles in scientific journals and books, and contributions to <i>the Flora of the Perth Region</i>, <i>Flora of Central Australia</i>, <i>Flora of New South Wales</i> and <i>Flora of Australia</i> projects. During this time I have also contributed significantly to the advisory, collecting, curatorial and editorial aspects of work at the Western Australian Herbarium.</p>

<p><i>Australian Botanical Liaison Officer.</i> During the period September 1984 - October 1985 I was seconded to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England as Australian Botanical Liaison Officer (ABLO) for which I was selected by the Council of Heads of Australian Herbaria in open competition with taxonomic botanists from throughout Australia.</p>

<p><i>Section Leader (SYSS).</i> In the period June 1989 to June 1990 I was Section Leader of the Western Australian Herbarium’s Systematics Section with responsibility for co-ordinating and leading professional and support staff participating in the herbarium’s research activities in the area of taxonomic botany.</p>

<p><i>Program Leader (FINP).</i> In July 1990 I was appointed Program Leader of the CALM Research Division’s Flora Information Program with responsibility for co-ordinating and leading professional and support staff participating in the herbarium’s research activities in this area of taxonomic botany, in the provision of the WA Herbarium’s advisory services and in the editing and production of Herbarium publications.</p>

<p><i>Manager (ISS).</i> In August 1995 I was appointed Manager of the CALM Science and Information Division’s Information Science Section with responsibility for (a) co-ordinating and leading professional staff participating in co-operative research projects across the Division, carrying out self-initiated research in the arena of information science, and developing applications and corporate information systems; and (b) managing technical staff providing support for the Division’s Local Area Networks.</p>

<p><i>Project Leader (ISA, ISR&amp;D).</i> Following a restructure of CALM Science and Information Division in January 1999 I was Project Leader of both Information Science Administration and Information Science Research &amp; Development. These projects broadly encompass the work of the former ISS (see above).</p>

<p><i>Assistant Manager (BIG).</i>&nbsp;From July 2000 until June 2006&nbsp;I&nbsp; provided managerial and administrative assistance to the Manager of the Biological Information Group. In this role&nbsp;I was concerned with&nbsp;staffing matters, policy advice and the drafting of reports and ministerial correspondence.</p>

<p>From July 2006 onwards I have reduced my working hours under a transistion to retirement arrangement. In this time my focus has been on my taxonomic researches and on forensic botany.</p>

<p><i>Present Classification.</i> Principal Research Scientist, Level 7.</p>

<p><strong>Honorary Research Associate, Western Australian Herbarium, December 2013—</strong></p>

<p>Since retirement I continue to work part-time in an honorary capacity. My activities include taxonomic research on Australian Asteraceae, Editorial assistance to the WA Herbarium's house journal <i>Nuytsia</i>, and the provision of forensic services to the WA Police.</p>

<p>Flora of Australia: A synopsis of my 30 years taxonomic research on Australian acacias is contained in my contribution to Flora of Australia vol. 11A and 11B (expected to be published in 1998).</p>

<p>WATTLE: An electronic identification and information system for Australian acacias is currently in progress. WATTLE expands the knowledge base contained in the Flora of Australia treatment of Acacia and makes the information more readily accessible (especially through an interactive multi-access key to the species).</p>

<p>Applied research: Studies have been undertaken which examined the multipurpose utilisation of Acacia, its potential as a human food supplement, and its relevance in conservation and landscape amelioration programs.</p>

<p>Collaborations: Extensive national and international collaborative research has been undertaken on Acacia and this has involved work in the fields of systematics (taxonomy, phylogeny, typification and nomenclature), biogeography (of Australian species), phytochemistry (particularly cyanogenetic glycosides) and anatomy (of phyllodes).</p>

<p>Curation. The collections of Acacia at the Western Australian are comprehensive and well curated. These specimens now provide a reliable information resource for anyone undertaking work on this large genus. Of special note is the type specimen information that has been gathered from herbaria both nationally and internationally.</p>","<ul>

Leader of the Ecosystem Science program coordinating the work of scientific and technical staff based at six work centres throughout Western Australia.</p>

<p>Research interests: I have worked as a scientist for 36 years studying aspects of the behaviour and ecological effects of fire in forests, shrublands and semi-arid woodlands in Western Australia. From 1996 to 2007 I was the principal Western Australian scientific investigator for <i>Project Vesta</i> a large-scale collaborative forest fire experiment involving CSIRO, state agencies and international scientists. <i>Project Vesta</i> investigated the behaviour and spread of high intensity bushfires in dry eucalypt forests with different fuel ages and understorey vegetation structures and was designed to quantify age-related changes in fuel attributes and fire behaviour in dry eucalypt forests. In February 2009 I joined a team of fire scientists assembled by the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre to undertake initial investigation into aspects of the behaviour of the Victorian bushfires of Black Saturday 7 February 2009, and subsequently provided expert advice to the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission in relation to the effect of prescribed burning in mitigating the severity of these bushfires.</p>

My research covers various aspects of wetland ecology, with a focus on aquatic invertebrates and waterbirds. Most of my research projects involve analysing patterns in the distribution of biodiversity in space (biological survey) or time (monitoring) and understanding the reasons why those patterns exist (effects of natural and human-influenced environmental drivers).</p>

<p>Prior to joining the department in 1996 I had worked at the Museum of Victoria and a consulting firm in the USA on aquatic oligochaete systematics, and before that I worked on nuisance midge control at Murdoch University.</p>","<p>My research has focused on various aspects of wetland fauna and ecology, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>monitoring and control of nuisance aquatic organisms</li>
	<li>survey and monitoring of aquatic fauna communities including waterbirds</li>
	<li>biogeographic patterning of aquatic fauna</li>
	<li>wetland ecology and conservation</li>
	<li>systematics of aquatic invertebrates, especially oligochaetes (earthworms)</li>
</ul>","","<p>The following projects are either being undertaken at present or were completed within the last six years.</p>

<p><strong>Biological survey of mound springs in northern Western Australia (2015-present). </strong>In collaboration with Kimberley Region staff,&nbsp;traditional owner groups a number of springs and spring groups have been surveyed for aquatic invertebrates and flora, starting with springs at Walyarta (Mandora Marsh in the Great Sandy Desert, organic springs in the western and eastern Kimberley, Nimalarragan wetland north of Broome and most recently Dragon Tree Soak, also in the Great Sandy Desert. The springs provide important aquatic habitat and reliable water for fauna and flora that would otherwise be absent from the region, including some species likely to be restricted to the springs. This research has been funded by BHP, Yaruwu Park Council,&nbsp;the Kimberley Science and Conservation Initiative and other DBCA funds and has been written up in several reports.</p>

<p><strong>Aquatic invertebrate biodiversity in wetlands used by the western swamp tortoise (2013 to present)</strong>. In conjunction with the Department's Swan Region, aquatic invertebrate biodiversity was surveyed in a number of shallow vegetated claypans on the Swan Coastal Plain, including those supporting western swamp tortoise. Temporary vegetated claypans have been poorly surveyed on the Swan Coastal Plain so this was an opportunity to provide more data on their values. Aquatic invertebrates are a major food source for the tortoises so we are also assessing the biomass of aquatic invertebrates in the same wetlands. The latest aspect of this work is a <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.3543"">Masters project</a> that showed that potential translocation habitats along the south coast have sufficient food resources to support western swamp tortoise. These data are now being combined with data for other wetlands for an analysis of biodiversity patterning in vegetated swamps of south-western Australia.</p>

<p><strong>State Salinity Strategy Wetland Monitoring project (1997 to 2019)</strong>. Biennial monitoring of 25 wetlands in the Wheatbelt and South Coast regions has been undertaken, mostly by David Cale and Michael Lyons, from 1997 to 2016 (to 2012 for the fauna component). From this project we now have a much better understanding of the long-term dynamics of a range of different types of wetlands and how their flora and fauna respond to pressures such as <a href=""http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/content/category/25/301/1620/"">salinity</a> (including that resulting from declining rainfall) and altered hydrology (see <a href=""#"">information sheet #80</a>). Several publications have arisen from this work and an honours student has recently submitted a paper on responses of alpha, beta and gamma diversity to the drying Wheatbelt climate using these data.</p>

<p><strong>Waterbird monitoring in the Warden and Gore Ramsar wetlands (2006 to present)</strong>. This project has monitored waterbirds using the Lake Warden and Lake Gore Ramsar wetland systems, with the aims of 1) understanding usage by waterbirds of individual wetlands, 2) understanding patterns in waterbird usage over time and 3) monitor the effectiveness of engineering solutions to excess water in the Warden system (see <a href=""#"">Landscope vol. 30, issue 1</a>). This work is now part of a larger Ramsar wetland monitoring project. The focus of this work now is to model waterbird communities in these wetlands against local and regional water availability.</p>

<p><strong>Fortescue valley wetlands survey (2015-2017). </strong>This work, funded by the <a href=""http://www.pilbaracorridors.com.au/"">Pilbara Corridors Project</a>, described how aquatic invertebrates and wetland flora are distributed across a variety of wetland types in the Fortescue Valley. These analyses resulted in a number of principals that can be used to ensure that wetland conservation programs maximise representation of wetland biodiversity. The full report can be found <a href=""https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/images/documents/conservation-management/wetlands/fortescue_-valley_wetlands_survey_2017.pdf"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lake Carnegie biological survey (2019-present). </strong>This biological survey project aims to assess the biodiversity values of the large (100km long) Lake Carnegie, an arid zone episodically filled salt lake and associated wetland complexes. This data will be used to assess this wetland system against Ramsar criteria&nbsp; and for informing development of management processes, including reservation, with native title holders Tarlpa Matuwa Piarku Aboriginal Corporation. This study is complemented by a&nbsp;wider ongoing survey of wetlands in the Goldfields.</p>

<p><strong>Spread and distribution of redclaw crayfish in the Pilbara. </strong>Redclaw is&nbsp;an Australian native crayfish but its natural range is eastern NT and northern Qld.&nbsp;In Western Australia, they are an introduced species, originally to the&nbsp;lower&nbsp;Ord River in the Kimberley, then into the Harding Dam in the Pilbara. The species remained in the Harding Dam for several years but from at least 2017 has been deliberately introduced to?numerous&nbsp;sites in the Pilbara?(which otherwise lacks crayfish)?and?is?spreading?within those catchments.?There is potential for this species to be translocated and flourish much further south, as has occurred in south-eastern Australia. With Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development three surveys for redclaw have been undertaken. The most recent (May 2021) was aimed at better understanding the impact of redclaw on Pilbara River Pools, following an <a href=""https://www.reabic.net/journals/bir/2019/4/BIR_2019_Pinder_etal.pdf"">earlier study</a> that suggested they may have significant impact.</p>

<p><strong>Aquatic Oligochaete Systematics (ongoing)</strong>. Aside from the above work I also undertake research into the systematics of aquatic oligochaetes (earthworms) of the Australasian region, concentrating at present on species from surface water and groundwater of the Pilbara and elsewhere in Western Australia, but also from New Zealand and its territories. Data on the diversity of Australian aquatic oligochaetes is available at <a href=""http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/online-resources/fauna/index.html"">Australian oligochaete diversity</a>. Recent papers include a study of invasive earthworms in the south-west, a paper on the genetic diversity of stygofaunal oligochaetes in the Pilbara and a description of a new species from subantarctic Campbell Island. A new guide to aquatic earthworms of Australia and New Zealand is in press.</p>","","2021-07-05 16:58:20",0

Early work focused on the then very lively public issue of kangaroo management. In the marine sphere, WA dugong population studies were initiated independently in 1977. DEC has since assumed greater formal involvement with dugong population surveys of this region commencing 1989. Regional sea turtle conservation work complementary to the earlier dugong and seagrass-ecosystem and environmental management focus was developed through the Western Australian Marine Turtle Proiect (WAMTP), commencing 1986. Participatory Engagement of external support for the WAMTP was actively sought and received from industry, community and the public.</p>","","","",1

<p>Research experience</p>

<p>i) Honours thesis: The biology of Heterobasidion hemitephram (Now renamed Fomitopsis hemitephrum). This project described the infection biology, breeding biology and population dynamics of the wood decay fungus Fomotopsis hemitephrum in Nothofagus cunninghamii (myrtle beech).</p>

<p>ii) PhD thesis: Response of western larch and Douglas-fir to infection by Armillaria ostoyae. This research investigated host response, in the form of whole lesion formation, periderm formation and changes in protein profiles in phloem tissues, of western larch and Douglas-fir to infection by the root pathogen Armillaria ostoyae. This research was carried out in British Columbia, Canada.</p>

<p>iii) Project Officer, Forestry Tasmania: In 1990 I was responsible for researching and producing a general guide book titled ""Rainforest Fungi of Tasmania and Southeast Australia"". The guide includes introductory text and colour photographs of 115 species of fungi from temperate rainforest in Tasmania and Victoria.</p>

<p>iv) Research Officer, Department of Conservation and Land Management, Western Australia. Since 1996 I have been investigating armillaria root disease (caused by <i>Armillaria luteobubalina</i>) in regenerated karri forests. This has involved investigating control of the pathogen by utilising alternative operational methods in forest management and possible biocontrol using wood decay fungi. This has involved investigating the below ground incidence of the disease and behaviour of the pathogen on a range of site quality types, the effects of past thinning operations on the spread of the disease, and the effect armillaria root disease has on tree growth. The effectiveness of above-ground disease survey has also been investigated.</p>

<p>My other area of study is investigating the effect which fire has on the fruiting of macro fungi in regrowth karri forests. The study covers individual species as well as communities and is monitoring the succession of fungi from the early colonisers found on recently burnt ground to the more stable communities colonising long unburnt sites. The study also involves collaborative work on the taxonomy of southern forest fungi. I am also involved in FORESTCHECK where I will be monitoring fungal species and litter accumulation in the southern jarrah forest following forest management activities.</p>

<p><strong>iii) Technical Assistant and Technical Officer, Forests Department of WA (Wanneroo Research Station)</strong></p>

<p>In 1977-79 I worked on various pine silviculture and breeding research projects under the supervision of Mr T.B.Butcher.</p>

<p><strong>iv) Technical Officer and (from 1982) Research Officer, Forests Department of WA (Department of Conservation and Land Management from 1985) (Como Research Centre)</strong></p>

<p>In 1979-80 I undertook an investigation of the cause of mortalities of <i>Pinus radiata</i> in the Donnybrook Sunkland Plantations, in collaboration with Mr H.W.Chevis. <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i> (the cause of jarrah dieback) was consistently implicated, and <i>P. cryptogea, P. citricola</i> and <i>P. megasperma</i> were also found.</p>

<p>In 1979-82 I worked with Mr T.B.Butcher to determine whether genetically based resistance to <i>P. cinnamomi</i> is present in <i>Pinus radiata</i>. Useable levels of resistance were found, and this led to a major selection program (1981-1999) covering the Australian Breeding Population as well as testing the native Californian populations of <i>P. radiata</i>. Resistant selections derived from this program are now established in seed orchards and their progeny are used in all plantations where <i>Phytophthora</i> is likely to be present. Genetic gains in growth of resistant stands in <i>Phytophthora</i>-infested areas are significant.</p>

<p>In 1985 I initiated a project to determine whether genetically based resistance to <i>P. cinnamomi</i> exists in <i>Eucalyptus marginata</i> (jarrah). Useable resistance levels were found, and a broad-scale selection program was commenced (1988 on). Under a cooperative agreement with Alcoa World Alumina Australia Ltd, Murdoch University and Edith Cowan University, resistant jarrah lines have been propagated for trial plantings and the establishment of seed orchards. This work is continuing. Small plots of resistant jarrah were established in CALM’s diseased forest rehabilitation sites in several districts in the 1990s. Planting of a production seed orchard for dieback-resistant jarrah was started in 2001 at the Forest Products Commission’s Plant Propagation Centre at Manjimup.</p>

<p>In 1998 I initiated a series of trials aiming to determine whether genetically based resistance to <i>P.cinnamomi</i> is present in <i>Banksia coccinea</i>.</p>

<p>Since June 2000, I have been monitoring the occurrence of Mundulla Yellows disease in eucalypts in the south-west, in collaboration with researchers at The University of Adelaide.</p>

<p>Between 1985 and 1993 I was responsible for the identification (to species) of all <i>Phytophthora</i>s isolated in routine field sampling on CALM lands in the south-west.</p>

<h4>Other Activities</h4>

<p><strong>i) Science Services</strong></p>

<p>I carried out identifications of <i>Phytophthora</i> species for CALM’s dieback mapping program between 1985 and 1993, and was responsible for establishing and maintaining the department’s <i>Phytophthora</i> database and culture collection. I was responsible for establishing the Dieback Disease Detection Service (now the Vegetation Health Service, VHS) laboratory at Como Research Centre early in 1992, and managed this laboratory until August 1993. I have again been manager of the VHS laboratory since July 2001.</p>

<p>Research Experience</p>

<p>My career commenced with a technical officer position. I worked on the design and construction of ventilated chambers, huge installations used to measure the transpiration of individual jarrah and marri trees. This was a period of wide ranging technical challenges and achievements which gave me a strong background in instrument use, application, and development.</p>

<p>I then worked on techniques for estimating leaf surface area in the jarrah forest. Initially developing allometric relationships between leaf area and tree and crown attributes, I applied these both to measure leaf area, and to validate broad scale remote techniques, such as hemispherical photography and remote sensing using the Geoscan multispectral scanner.</p>

<p>For a brief period I worked on a number of stem injection trials of the herbicides, Roundup (glyphosate) and Tordon Timber Control (picloram and triclopyr). I identified the dose mortality response of jarrah and marri trees to these herbicides, and the environmental factors affecting their effectiveness. I have also conducted research on the cost and effectiveness of various herbicide application systems.</p>

<p>Since 1994 I have occupied a Research Scientist position. In this role I have studied the occurrence of hollows that are used by arboreal fauna in the jarrah forest. This has included work on tree age and the age at which hollows form, the internal dimensions of hollows used by various arboreal fauna, the relationship between tree age, size, and crown form, and the occurrence of hollows, and the length of time that trees retained after logging to provide this habitat function, will remain standing. My most recent research has examined the effects of fire frequency on soil organic matter, the effect of soil compaction of karri tree growth and the application of Montreal Indicators 4.1d and 4.1e.</p>","<ul>

I have since been fortunate to have come in contact with, and in some cases to have worked with, several mentors. The first, LC Birch, was a Professor of Biology at the University of Sydney and was my first contact with a first-rate mind. He was an eminent Australian ecologist who achieved success at a young age as the co-architect of a general theory of ecology. Very much influenced by the British philosopher Whitehead he taught me to look behind Appearance for Reality, the Big Picture. Perhaps rather foolishly I did not follow his recommendation that I pursue a career in ecological entomology; instead my great interest in birdlife led me to begin research in avian ecology.</p>

<p>Eventually the opportunity of working with PR Grant was taken. He is only about 10 years older than me and at that stage was a promising British scientist with a rising reputation in bird ecology. I proposed to solve some interesting perplexities in the Galápagos Archipelago and he arranged the financing of the expedition. It is from him that I learned about asking the right questions, attending to the necessary detail, and economy of research effort. Incidentally, both Birch and Grant could produce the most readable, lucid and unambiguous scientific prose and thereby unwittingly provided a model worth imitating.</p>

<p>My third influencing figure was OW Loneragan, a member of the Forests Department of Western Australia and with whom I collaborated closely in the early 1980s. He was the Sherlock Holmes of the jarrah forest. That is, on entering a stand he could within a few minutes deduce from uncanny observation of existing clues the whole history of European influence that stand had experienced. To me this was a wonderful revelation of how to penetrate the secrets of nature. This reinforced my great interest in understanding past events to explain the origin of present patterns. The ""book"" of nature can only be read with profit and understood if one cultivates this perspicacity.</p>

<p>In my research career I have been able to gain very broad experience, having worked on both simple systems (islands) and complex systems (soils and forests), at different scales (from small soil samples to whole archipelagoes), and on different organisms (from small soil insects to birds and trees).</p>

<p>Why I became a scientist</p>

<p>As foreshadowed above, several of these reasons motivated me to become a scientist; others only became obvious subsequently.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I’m curious about nature, how it is put together and how it works. The “plot” of the “book” of nature is more bizarre that any novel by Thomas Hardy or Patrick White!</li>
	<li>I like to have my intellect stimulated.</li>
	<li>Much of scientific knowledge is counter-intuitive and thus full of surprises. T.H. Huxley’s dictum that ""science is nothing but trained and organised common sense..."" is wrong. We need always to look behind the obvious.</li>
	<li>Scientific knowledge is incorruptible. The most junior scientist can overthrow long-held and cherished ideas that a senior scientist has studied for decades.</li>
	<li>Quality of ideas and empirical evidence are much neglected hallmarks of science - one has only to scan current issues of science journals to realize how difficult it is to think up and validate new ways of looking at nature.</li>
	<li>A sharp demarcation between the objective and subjective is possible (unlike other professions such as law, sculpture, politics). Scientists are given free rein in their creativity to think up bizarre ideas and conjectures but are then expected to subject these concepts to objective scrutiny by nature and by other scientists.</li>
	<li>Nothing is ever known with absolute certainty: there is thus prospect for continual improvement in understanding. This is an exciting concept for young scientists as it means that they can make a contribution to the advancement of learning.</li>
	<li>Science is anti-democratic and subversive. It counts for nothing that a majority holds a particular viewpoint without evidence. Subversive refers to the power of new and important ideas in changing how others view nature.</li>
	<li>Not only does knowledge enable objective understanding of cause and effect, it confers wealth and power. This is exemplified by bioprospecting: Knowing which chemicals are in plants and which of these are efficacious against human diseases ultimately will alleviate much human suffering. Equally importantly, if a small proportion of profits from bioprospecting is allocated to improving our knowledge of basic taxonomy, ecology and physiology, we can improve the employment prospects of young West Australians in science and retain Intellectual Property within Western Australia.</li>

</ol>

<p>iii) Postdoctoral Fellowship, McGill University:</p>

<p>Four months’ field work in the Galápagos Islands in 1973 was spent addressing the problems raised in Sect. 6 of my PhD thesis (i.e. the roles of floristic diversity among islands and differences in competitive background of islands in explaining the variation in beak morphology and distribution of the six groundfinch species.)</p>

<p>I also extended a metrical analysis begun by David Lack in the 1940s by measuring on nearly 6 000 museum specimens of <i>Geospiza </i>body dimensions of ecological importance. The purpose was to document properly character convergence and divergence.</p>

<p>iv) Postdoctoral fellowships, University of Western Australia</p>

<p>In the Zoology Department, I studied the biogeography of land bird species in relation to habitat structure and floristics on islands round south-western Australia and the adjacent mainland. An electrophoretic study of geographical variation in the passerine bird <i>Zosterops lateralis</i> was also undertaken.</p>

<p>In the Soil Science and Plant Nutrition Department, I studied the impact of agricultural practices on the abundance of soil fauna, and the effect of soil animals (particularly earthworms) on soil structure.</p>

<p>v) Research Officer, Forests Department of Western Australia (in 1985 amalgamated with other government agencies into the Department of Conservation and Land Management)</p>

<p>From 1979 until 1997 nearly all my research was conducted in the forests of the south-west of Western Australia. Initially my brief was to examine the effects of prescribed low intensity fires on the soil fauna of the jarrah forest. I next evaluated if <i>Banksia grandis</i> could be successfully reduced in abundance in the jarrah forest.</p>

<p>In 1982 I began, in co-operation with Mr O Loneragan, a synthesis of all available data on the ecology and silviculture of jarrah, the principal timber species of Western Australia. Deficiencies in knowledge were identified, and we then studied the factors influencing the rate of wood growth of jarrah. On occasion I was asked to investigate specific problems - their solution resulted in publications on impact of logging on birds and regeneration failure of <i>Persoonia elliptica</i>.</p>

<p>In 1984 I was appointed forest entomologist. Emphasis has been on pest insects such as jarrah leafminer and bullseye borer, but I have also taken the opportunity to research the distribution and abundance of a considerable number of non-pest insects in jarrah forest.</p>

<p>vi) Doctor of Science thesis:</p>

<p>This thesis, entitled <i>Studies of pattern and process in biogeography, community ecology, and population ecology</i>, is based on 49 publications selected in 1990 from my total output then of 104 publications. Forty of these publications represent research undertaken within Western Australia. The thesis is organized in four sections:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Biogeography of species on islands, with special reference to rates of immigration and extinction.</li>
	<li>Morphological variation within and between populations of birds on islands - causes and effects.</li>
	<li>Responses of soil invertebrates to land use, climate and fire.</li>
	<li>Ecology of the major tree species in the northern Jarrah forest of Western Australia.</li>
</ol>

<p>The University of Western Australia awards the DSc degree for ‘independent and original research which constitutes a substantial and distinguished contribution’. The papers presented for this degree should show ‘clear evidence of significantly advancing science as reflected in the quality rather than the number of publications’. The candidate’s research should demonstrate a ‘high degree of innovative thinking in terms of the development and testing of hypotheses and new investigative procedures, and should be recognized as such by the scientific community at large’.</p>

<p>Other activities</p>

<p>i) Seminars and conferences</p>

<p>In 1986 I was awarded a grant from the MR Jacobs fund administered by the Australian Academy of Science. This was taken up in May 1987 and enabled me to travel widely in the Eastern States of Australia (Armidale, Sydney, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Melbourne, Adelaide), during which I conferred with more than 40 entomologists and gave a seminar on my forest insect research to the University of New England (Zoology Department), Forestry Commission of NSW (Beecroft) and Waite Institute of Agricultural Research (Glen Osmond).</p>

<p>In 1989 I presented a paper at an international conference on population dynamics of forest insects held at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1994, I presented a paper at an Australian Rangelands conference held at Katherine, Northern Territory</p>

<p>In 1998, I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1998 I presented a poster paper at the International Conference on Indicators for Sustainable Forest Management held in Melbourne.</p>

<p>In 1999 I presented a paper on the role of ecological and evolutionary principles in ecologically sustainable forest management at a conference on ecological theory held at the University of Western Australia.</p>

<p>In 2000 I presented a paper at a Scientists for Sustainability colloquium held at Batemans Bay and at Canberra.</p>

<p>In 2002 I presented a paper on Aboriginal burning in south-west Western Australia at a conference on fire held in Perth.</p>

<p>In 2005 I presented a paper on epizootic disease associated with mammalian faunal collapse in Western Australia at the 51st conference of the Australian Mammal Society, held in Albany (also presented in 2007 at an animal disease symposium held at Perth Zoo).</p>

<p>In 2007 I presented a paper on monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and a paper on south-west Western Australia to SANBI (the South African National Biodiversity Institute) and to students at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>ii) Administration</p>

<p>I was OIC of the Forests Department Research Station, Como from 1984 to 1985. At that time the staff comprised six research officers and seven technicians. In 1986 I was appointed to the newly created position of leader of the jarrah program in CALM. My duties were to co-ordinate and direct research within this program, prepare the budget and allocate finance within the program, co-ordinate contact between the program and the rest of CALM, and liaise and encourage co-operative research with external institutions. This program comprised eight scientists.</p>

<p>From 1987 to 1991 I was leader of the entomology research program, and in 1988 I was appointed Principal Research Scientist with responsibility for general administration of Research Division publishing, research project plans and productivity monitoring, and assisting the Senior Principal Research Scientist administer forest research.</p>

<p>In 1989 I prepared for the Research Division Policy Group a substantial report entitled Scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity (43 pp.). This addressed many issues, including scientific images, types of scientific research, systems of scientific research management, accountability, publishing in scholarly journals, publication productivity among scientists, reasons for the low average production of publications, citations, motivating scientists, recruitment, attitudes of scientists in Research Division of CALM about the assessment of scientific excellence, effectiveness and productivity, obtaining higher publication rates, and obtaining higher citation rates.</p>

<p>My role as Science Adviser involved formulation of policies, analysis of issues and provision of high quality advice to the Director of Science Division. I also addressed important and pressing scientific issues relevant to CALM and provided recommendations and options for their resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Putting research results into practice</strong></p>

<p>A major obligation of a scientist working in a Government Department is the production of outcomes of practical benefit to the objectives of that Department. Highlights of such implementation of my research findings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ecology and silviculture of jarrah - results on thinning, forest structure and stand dynamics have been incorporated into revision of prescriptions for logging and regeneration of jarrah forest, formulated by Forest Management Branch, CALM. (Silviculture Guidelines 1/95, 4/97).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Ecological impact of fire in jarrah forest - my research on soil/litter fauna, though collected some 30 years after the policy of regular burning in spring was introduced, shows few deleterious impacts. Similarly, more intense fires have few long-term effects on soil/litter fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Better understanding of the population biology of the understorey tree species <i>Banksia grandis</i> (a host of the pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) in jarrah forest was used to underpin CALM's forest improvement scheme. The density of <i>B. grandis</i> was reduced in parts of the jarrah forest at risk from dieback disease in order to lessen inoculum density of the pathogen.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Intense logging of jarrah forest has few short term effects on the composition or density of the bird fauna.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Prescribed burning in spring and logging of jarrah forest do not promote outbreaks of the pest insect defoliator, jarrah leafminer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of bullseye borer in regrowth karri forest may be reduced by thinning stands to alleviate water stress and by not planting karri in coupes where it did not occur naturally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Outbreaks of the introduced bark beetle <i>Ips grandicollis</i> in pine plantations are eliminated if stands are thinned on schedule and if thinning slash is promptly removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions of species of vertebrates and vascular plants have been demonstrated to be minimal in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as have contractions in geographical range of these taxa.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hotspots of plant species richness in the Regional Forest Agreement area of southwest Western Australia were identified from a study for which I had the lead role in formulation and planning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Conservation planning – I had the lead role in developing a forest monitoring concept plan known as FORESTCHECK.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Extinctions and declines of mammal species in Western Australia – I have developed the hypothesis that declines have occurred in an identifiable sequence, with the major causes being epizootic disease, predation by the self-established red fox, and destruction of habitat for agriculture. Predation by feral cats, prescribed burning, and logging in forests do not fit the historical evidence. My historical research has also clarified the original geographical range of many conspicuous mammal and bird species; this knowledge is essential in deciding where species should be translocated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Research Profile</p>

<p>The key elements of successful ecological investigation are: sound scholarship (awareness of past and current research; an objective, evidence-based approach that does not selectively cite information); clear conceptualization of the research question (hypothesis); and openness to other epistemologies (historical information; Aboriginal knowledge). Theories based on these attributes are most likely to provide valid explanations.</p>

<p>Exhaustive searching and comprehensive study of historical documents has led to a deep admiration of the scientific literature that existed before I graduated in 1969. The modern tendency to ignore or overlook scientific literature older than about 10 years runs the risk of ecology concentrating on the fashionable topics of the day.</p>

<p>From 1989 I became more involved in synthesizing information. I co-authored a scientific review of the impact of fire, a paper that distilled a set of ecological principles relevant to forest management, a paper dispelling incorrect perspectives about homogeneity and scale of fire management in the south-west forests, and I published a review of anthropogenic impacts on the jarrah forest avifauna.</p>

<p>The following sub-disciplines constitute the basis of my scientific reputation.</p>

<p>Island ecology 1969-2010</p>

<p>I have researched (and visited) many islands, including Tasmania, the larger islands in Bass Strait, the Galápagos, and the islands of Western Australia. Questions investigated include: Why are so many species that are present on the adjacent mainland absent from islands? Why are some and not other species present? Why do some species and not others diverge morphologically from their mainland ancestors? What is the relative influence of habitat, food resources, and competitor species on the morphology of island species? How dynamic are island biotas? How influential are seabird populations on the island biota?</p>

<p>Many of the conclusions reached from these studies conflict with accepted thinking, which has tended to emphasize island area, degree of isolation, and absence of competitor species as the principal factors determining the size and composition of island biotas. My studies have demonstrated that habitat structure, floristics, soil nutrient status, degree of exposure to salt laden winds, and presence of humans (Aboriginal people) are also as important.</p>

<p>Forest ecology 1979-2010</p>

<p>Initially, my research in this topic concerned the ecology of a ‘pest’ native plant species, <i>Banksia grandis</i>, in jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata)</i> forest. This species is a major host of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>, which kills the principal timber and dominant tree species (jarrah). My supervisors in the Forests Department also assigned me to write up data relating to the silviculture of jarrah. There was some urgency in that the research silviculturist, Owen Loneragan, was due to retire in 1984. We thus worked together as a team, locating and analysing all relevant data, undertaking follow-up remeasurements of growth plots as necessary, and synthesizing the mass of information discovered into publishable papers about growth, coppice, site quality, and thinning. Subsequently, I commenced studies of germination and growth of seedlings of all tree species present in the northern jarrah forest. Spatial pattern, forest structure, and tree species composition were also studied. An encyclopaedic monograph of the ecology of jarrah was published in 1986.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s I studied the distribution and abundance of native and introduced earthworm species in the northern jarrah forest. In 1985 I commenced research on pest insect species in jarrah forest, especially on jarrah leafminer. In order to contextualize this study, I sampled accessible foliage on jarrah trees with a cherrypicker and produced a bibliography of forest entomological research. A study of leaf damage caused by insects in jarrah forest quantified its geographical extent and relative importance compared to fungi. Damage by a stem borer to the regeneration of the other principal timber species, karri <i>(Eucalyptus diversicolor)</i>, was investigated in relation to site and stand factors. Substantial effort was put into compiling a comprehensive list of insect species that had been recorded in the forests of south-west Western Australia, as the concept of biodiversity had only recently emerged and the concept of sustainability was broadening from an economic focus to an ecological one.</p>

<p>Fire ecology 1979-2007</p>

<p>My research in fire ecology in jarrah forest comprised two broad themes. The first is the impact of fire (often associated with logging) on the biota, in particular: the growth rate of the dominant forest tree in south-west Western Australia (jarrah); invertebrates in soil and litter, including more detailed studies of native earthworms, cockroaches, crickets and grasshoppers; germination and flowering of the understorey tree <i>Banksia grandis</i>; the native insect jarrah leafminer in outbreak; and the avifauna.</p>

<p>The ecological techniques used have varied according to the organism under study: accurate measurement of tree growth; pitfall trapping and hand sorting of soil cores for invertebrates; and counting of birds. Most studies were longitudinal manipulative experiments; some were retrospective (’natural experiments’). Analytical techniques have followed contemporary statistical procedures. One study was one of the earliest to include sampling before the fire, and another seems to have been the first in Australia to examine the cumulative impact of many (17) fires on the physical, chemical and faunal features of litter and soil.</p>

<p>The second theme of my research in fire ecology in jarrah forest was the significant use of fire by Aborigines until their detribalization in the 1860s. In 1983 I started to integrate records of Aboriginal burning in south-west WA by early observers with available scientific data on fire behaviour. I synthesized information from a close reading of &gt; 150 records from the period 1658-1888. This, and reviews of fire impact on terrestrial invertebrates and island plants and birds, were published in the book <i>Fire in Ecosystems of South-west Western Australia: Impacts and Management</i> that I co-edited.</p>

<p>The overall ecological significance of my fire research is the demonstration that frequent burning of jarrah forest is not deleterious to most of the biota. The reason seems to be that fuel levels kept low by frequent fires burn at low intensity. This leaves a fine-scale mosaic of patches that do not all burn with every fire, thereby leaving intact populations that can readily recolonize the burnt patches as soon as habitat on them becomes suitable. To better align with past Aboriginal fire management, parts of the jarrah forest would benefit from being burnt every 3-4 years in summer and autumn. This should produce an intricate mosaic of patches beneficial to invertebrates and fungi, which comprise most of forest biodiversity.</p>

<p>Extinction ecology, 1995-2010</p>

<p>My research in this theme began when public disquiet with forest management in Western Australia intensified. Conservationists claimed that logging and associated burning (particularly clear felling and wood-chipping) had caused the extinction of species in jarrah and karri forests. This led me to study the distribution of plant, bird and mammal species in south-west Western Australia, resulting in publication of maps showing the actual occurrence of extinct species or extinct populations. Few were in forests and none of these could be linked to logging.</p>

<p>I then became interested in determining why a conspicuous marsupial species, the bilby <i>Macrotis lagotis</i>, declined and became regionally extinct in south-west WA after the 1930s. Much effort was put into establishing its original geographic range and then evaluating the timing and extent of declines in relation to a checklist of potentially important factors. The arrival of the fox from South Australia was shown to be the critical factor.</p>

<p>A popular view in the 1990s was that feral cats had arrived in Australia when Dutch ships were wrecked on the WA coast in the 1600s-1700s. An exhaustive survey of historical records instead revealed that cats had been introduced wherever Europeans had settled during the period 1788-1890. A conceptual model of the spread of the cat across Australia from these many introductions indicated that feral cats and many native mammal species had coexisted for many decades before the native mammal species had declined to extinction.</p>

<p>My historical research has indicated that marsupials were very abundant in south-west WA in the first 50 years of British settlement. Using records obtained from sources rarely accessed by zoologists, I determined when species began to decline and showed that an epizootic disease spread through much of WA in the period 1880-1920. I also documented when, how, and why the fox was introduced into Victoria, and ascertained from historical records when impacts on native birds and mammals first began to be noticed in south-eastern Australia.</p>","","","",1

My role is to conduct research to support the implementation of prescribed fire management in the Kimberley region.

The aim is to provide evidence that prescribed burning operations can be used to improve biodiversity status in Kimberley rangelands.</p>

<p>Volunteer field assistant: Fire Ecology of North Australian Mammals, 2013</p>

<p>A volunteer field assistant is needed to help Ian and Richard with a project investigating fire and mammal ecology in the Kimberley, northern Australia. This project relates to recent declines among native mammals across much of northern Australia. Field work will be conducted in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and based out of Kununurra from May to Sep 2013 (specific dates may vary). Volunteers will be involved with trapping, identifying, handling and measuring a range of mammal species from small rodents up to larger marsupials including possums, bandicoots and quolls (5 g - 5 kg). There will be significant involvement in measuring/identifying vegetation, habitat assessment and data entry. You will need to be prepared for early mornings, long hours in tropical conditions (e.g. long walks carrying traps over rocky terrain, high humidity and temperatures &gt;35oC), sharing cooking duties and living and working in a small team. You will need to have a good work ethic and you must be easy to get along with as field work under arduous conditions can bring out both the best and worst in people! Desirable qualifications include experience with animal handling and ecological methods for undertaking vegetation survey. Accommodation, food and travel associated with field work within Australia will be covered (about half of the time), however the volunteer will provide their own food while based in Kununurra and all their international travel costs. Some accommodation costs may be covered while in Kununurra.</p>

<p><strong>Deadline: April 20th 2013</strong></p>","<p>My main research interests are in fire ecology, plant invasion ecology, restoration of degraded landscapes and biological control. A broad perspective on environmental impacts associated with fire and plant invasive species has been gained through work across climatic zones from the dry tropics in northern Australia, through the coastal plains and ranges in NSW, to the cool temperate subalpine environments of New Zealand. Current work involves the impacts of fire regime on tropical biota in the Kimberley region of far north western Australia. My most recent work investigated the relative roles of plant functional traits, competition, disturbance and soil fungal mycorrhizal facilitation of alien plant (Hieracium lepidulum) invasion of south island New Zealand high country environments. Previous studies included the use of fire in restoration of tropical riparian ecosystems invaded by rubbervine (Cryptostegia grandiflora), research into invasion processes associated with Acacia nilotica in the Mitchell grasslands, and use of fire and biocontrol agents for the control of woody weeds in Queensland. I have also conducted studies into comparative ecology and invasive traits among closely related Senecio species, and genetic and taxonomic differentiation in variable species complexes.</p>","<p>Academic Qualifications</p>

Honours thesis: Ecology of sciaphilous sponges in the Perth region.</p>

<p><br>
There were two components of this honours research, the ecology of the sponge community and the taxonomy of sponges.<br>
The ecology investigated the spatial distribution of the sponge community, the influences of environmental parameters such as light, water motion and depth into the study cave. It incorporated the comparison of three currently used sampling/monitoring methods and the subsequent development of a photogrammetric sampling method. Community structure was investigated using both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.<br>
The taxonomy of sponges was a challenge, due to the many undescribed species in WA and their identification required specific histological techniques.</p>

<p>My current project is to research the effects of landscape configuration on gene flow among the very fragmented populations of a bird-pollinated <i>Banksia</i> species in the WA wheatbelt. The aim of this project is to develop an understanding of the way that the relative position of population remnants in the landscape can affect inter-population gene flow, and hence the genetic health, reproduction and long-term persistence of fragmented plant populations. This understanding will help with the development of guidelines for the coordinated management of multiple populations, the strategic positioning of revegetation efforts, and the prioritization of bush remnants for conservation.</p>","<ul>

	<li>Fire, fragmentation, weeds and the conservation of plant diversity in Wheatbelt nature reserves.

<p>Spatial modelling of recreational tourism in the Ningaloo Marine Park (Western Autralia); spatial data management and GIS analysis: What drives recreational coastal usage patterns at Ningaloo? Using spatial statistics (Principal Coordinate Analysis of Neighbourhood Matrices), Florian was able to explain 15% more variance in data than with known explanatory variables alone (30%). Florian also paved the gravel road to Gnaraloo station, a highly desirable but very remote and accommodation-limited surfing, snorkelling and diving paradise, thereby flooding it with day-tripping tourists from the nearby accommodation-rich city Carnarvon - luckily, this happened only in a simulation.</p>

In this role, Andrew supports and enacts government’s responsibilities by providing direction and support to the diverse range of activities undertaken by DBCA.</p>

<p>Andrew was the Assistant Director of Biodiversity and Conservation Science at DBCA from late 2019 to early 2020. He has previously held academic positions at the University of Stellenbosch and Rhodes University in South Africa, and most recently at Imperial College London, where he was a Director of the Masters in Conservation Science programme. Prior to entering academia, Andrew worked as a conservation planner with the (then) NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service on the expansion of the State’s protected area network and the development of systematic conservation planning approaches.</p>

<p>Andrew has worked and conducted applied conservation research and planning primarily in Australia, Namibia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. He has also participated in conservation research projects in northern Europe, South-east Asia, Southern Africa and North and South America. He has produced over 80 peer-reviewed articles.</p>

<p>Andrew completed a B.Sc. (Honours) in Earth and Environmental Sciences at Macquarie University in Sydney and his Ph.D. at Nelson Mandela University on the effectiveness of regional-scale, stakeholder-driven systematic conservation planning. His Ph.D. research examined the utility of integrating human and social data into spatial conservation prioritisations with a view to improve their feasibility, as well as the larger institutional and social processes driving the effectiveness, or not, of these initiatives.</p>

<p>Andrew’s research focus includes developing and applying psychometric tools and qualitative assessment techniques for understanding human values, attitudes and behaviours that can be used for monitoring and evaluation of conservation projects.</p>","<p>Andrew’s research has applied techniques from conservation planning, psychology, systems thinking and the organisation and policy sciences to assist government agencies to improve the approaches and outcomes of their conservation initiatives.</p>

<p>The foundation of Andrew's research&nbsp;lies in understanding the values, attitudes and behaviours of individuals and teams and the planning processes and institutions in which they work. This has included development of quantitative psychological instruments to improve the design of conservation strategies, for example, understanding the commitment of landholders to private land conservation initiatives, and the tolerance of people to human-wildlife coexistence challenges. His qualitative research has included applying systems thinking techniques to diagnose factors limiting the effectiveness of conservation initiatives, for example, palm oil supply chains and private land conservation programs. Andrew has also undertaken research into the adaptive capacity of rural landholders, social networks or subsistence natural resource users, institutional functioning and the design optimal mixes of policy instruments. Recently, his research has focused on developing techniques for understanding and positively adapting the attitudes and behaviours of conservation professionals towards learning from project failures. His early background involved research into integrating social and ecological information for holistic landscape assessments.</p>","<p><strong>Career History</strong></p>
