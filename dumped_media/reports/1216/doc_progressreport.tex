\section*{Project Rangelands Restoration: developing sustainable management
systems for the conservation of biodiversity at the landscape scale in
rangelands of the Murchison and Gascoyne bioregions--managing fire and
introduced predators
}

N Burrows, G Liddelow



\section*{Context}

Despite the relatively pristine nature of most of the arid interior
(desert bioregions) and rangelands (beyond the pastoral zone), there has
been an alarming and recent loss of mammal fauna, with about 90\% of
medium-size mammals and 33\% of all mammals either becoming extinct or
suffering massive range contractions. There is also evidence of
degradation of some floristic communities due to altered fires regimes.
The extent and nature of change in other components of the biodiversity,
including extant mammals, birds, reptiles and invertebrates is unknown.
The most likely causes of the decline and degradation in biodiversity
are introduced predators, especially the fox (\emph{Vulpes vulpes}) and
the feral cat (\emph{Felis catus}), and altered fire regimes since the
departure from traditional Aboriginal burning practices over much of the
region. Taking an adaptive experimental management approach in
partnership with Goldfields Region, this project aims to reconstruct
some assemblages of the original native mammal fauna on Lorna Glen, a
pastoral lease acquired by the Department. This will be achieved by an
integrated approach to controlling introduced predators and herbivores,
ecologically appropriate fire management, and fauna translocations.




\section*{Aims}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Develop efficient, effective and safe introduced predator (fox and
  feral cat) control technologies for the interior rangelands and the
  arid region.
\item
  Reconstruct the original suite of native mammal fauna through
  translocation once sustainable feral cat control can be demonstrated.
\item
  Implement a patch-burn strategy to create a fine-grained, fire-induced
  habitat mosaic to protect biodiversity and other values.
\item
  Describe and predict pyric (post-fire) plant succession and describe
  the life histories of key plant species.
\item
  Monitor the long-term trends in species assemblages and abundance of
  small mammals and reptiles in an area where introduced predators are
  not controlled compared with an area where they are controlled.
\item
  Model the relationship between seasons (rainfall) and the frequency
  and size of wildfires.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Progress}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Cat, fox and wild dog aerial baiting carried out in July 2013 as part
  of the Western Shield program was effective with the feral cat
  population reduced by 62\% to a Track Density Index of 7. Five of the
  seven feral cats that were trapped and radio-collared prior to baiting
  were killed by the baiting (70\% mortality).
\item
  A PhD project to investigate interactions between wild dogs/dingoes
  and wild cats resulted in some 16 dogs and 21 cats being trapped and
  fitted with GPS collars. Trail cameras (136) were located across Lorna
  Glen to collect additional data on the occurrence, distribution,
  density and activity of wild dogs and cats. The study is testing the
  hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between dog and cat
  density. The management implication is that retaining dingoes could
  result in a reduction in cats.
\item
  Mulgara (\emph{Dasycercus cristicauda}) population size has remained
  stable since last year and is still relatively high.
\item
  The fire management plan continued to be implemented, including
  further installation of fuel-reduced buffers around some fire
  management cells and some core ignition using aircraft.
\item
  With the assistance of Martu Rangers, 32 mulga trees were mechanically
  extracted and processed to determine biomass and carbon stocks in
  mulga as part of a program to determine whether good fire management
  in these ecosystems can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase
  carbon biosequestration.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Management implications}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  This project is providing insurance populations of threatened arid
  zone mammals.
\item
  Information will inform guidelines for the proactive management of
  fire in the arid zone rangelands to reduce the severity (scale and
  intensity) of wildfires and to provide habitat choice through mosaic
  burning.
\item
  Guidelines for controlling introduced predators in the arid zone
  rangelands will reduce this threat to native fauna. Reintroduction and
  protection of mammals of the arid zone rangelands, other extant fauna,
  vegetation and other elements of the biota will provide reconstruction
  of animal and plant assemblages in an arid zone ecosystem.
\item
  A framework and protocol for assessing and reporting trends in
  ecosystem condition in arid zone rangelands will provide a basis for
  ecosystem condition monitoring.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Future directions}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Assess and report on the effectiveness of wild cat and dog baiting.
\item
  Complete a report on 10 years of biodiversity monitoring at Lorna
  Glen, and a scientific paper.
\item
  Carry out a biological survey of Earaheedy.
\item
  Survey wild dogs, cats and mulgara on Earaheedy where there has been
  no introduced predator control, and compare results with Lorna Glen.
\item
  Continue to implement the fire management plan including buffer
  burning and aerial patch burning.
\end{itemize}
