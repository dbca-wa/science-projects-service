\section*{Project Rangelands Restoration: developing sustainable management
systems for the conservation of biodiversity at the landscape scale in
rangelands of the Murchison and Gascoyne bioregions--managing fire and
introduced predators
}

N Burrows, G Liddelow



\section*{Context}

Despite the relatively pristine nature of most of the arid interior
(desert bioregions) and rangelands (beyond the pastoral zone), there has
been an alarming and recent loss of mammal fauna, with about 90\% of
medium-size mammals and 33\% of all mammals either becoming extinct or
suffering massive range contractions. There is also evidence of
degradation of some floristic communities due to altered fires regimes.
The extent and nature of change in other components of the biodiversity,
including extant mammals, birds, reptiles and invertebrates is unknown.
The most likely causes of the decline and degradation in biodiversity
are introduced predators, especially the fox (\emph{Vulpes vulpes}) and
the feral cat (\emph{Felis catus}), and altered fire regimes since the
departure from traditional Aboriginal burning practices over much of the
region. Taking an adaptive experimental management approach in
partnership with Goldfields Region, this project aims to reconstruct
some assemblages of the original native mammal fauna on Matuwa (Lorna
Glen), a pastoral lease acquired by the Department. This will be
achieved by an integrated approach to controlling introduced predators
and herbivores, ecologically appropriate fire management, and fauna
translocations.




\section*{Aims}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Develop efficient, effective and safe introduced predator (fox and
  feral cat) control technologies for the interior rangelands and the
  arid region.
\item
  Reconstruct the original suite of native mammal fauna through
  translocation once sustainable feral cat control can be demonstrated.
\item
  Implement a patch-burn strategy to create a fine-grained, fire-induced
  habitat mosaic to protect biodiversity and other values.
\item
  Describe and predict pyric (post-fire) plant succession and describe
  the life histories of key plant species.
\item
  Monitor the long-term trends in species assemblages and abundance of
  small mammals and reptiles in an area where introduced predators are
  not controlled compared with an area where they are controlled.
\item
  Model the relationship between seasons (rainfall) and the frequency
  and size of wildfires.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Progress}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Aerial cat baiting~was carried out on Matuwa~in July 2015 as part of
  the Western Shield and Rangelands Restoration programs. To measure the
  effectiveness of baiting, remote~cameras were used in conjunction with
  traditional track counting~as part of a program to move predator
  surveys to using remote~cameras only. Baiting was moderately
  successful with the~cat track activity and camera activity indices
  showing~reductions due to baiting of~50\% and 60\% respectively,
  resulting in a post-bait cat track activity index~\textless{}10. This
  trial demonstrated that cameras can be reliably~used to survey cat
  density and are a significant cost saving.~The track activity index in
  the unbaited control (Earaheedy - Kurara Kurara) was 26, indicating
  that cat control~continues to be~successful on Matuwa.
\item
  The Mulgara (\emph{Dasycercus blythii}) population on Matuwa has
  declined, but is still significantly higher than before baiting
  commenced in 2003 and is~about double~the population on the
  nearby~unbaited Kurara Kurara.
\item
  The Matuwa~fire management plan continued to be implemented, including
  further installation of fuel-reduced buffers around some fire
  management cells and core ignition using aircraft. Some small
  patch-burning was carried out inside the predator-proof compound for
  wildfire~mitigation and to create habitat diversity.~
\end{itemize}




\section*{Management implications}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  This project is providing insurance populations of threatened arid
  zone mammals.
\item
  Information will inform guidelines for the proactive management of
  fire in the arid zone rangelands to reduce the severity (scale and
  intensity) of wildfires and to provide habitat choice through mosaic
  burning.
\item
  Guidelines for controlling introduced predators in the arid zone
  rangelands will reduce this threat to native fauna. Reintroduction and
  protection of mammals of the arid zone rangelands, other extant fauna,
  vegetation and other elements of the biota will provide reconstruction
  of animal and plant assemblages in an arid zone ecosystem.
\item
  A framework and protocol for assessing and reporting trends in
  ecosystem condition in arid zone rangelands will provide a basis for
  ecosystem condition monitoring.
\item
  Future monitoring of cat density and baiting effectiveness on
  feral~cats can be achieved through the use of cameras alone,
  delivering a significant cost saving for management.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Future directions}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Assess and report on the effectiveness of wild cat and dog baiting to
  be undertaken in July 2016.
\item
  Prepare a paper for publication reporting on 10 years of biodiversity
  monitoring on Matuwa.
\item
  Survey wild dogs, cats and mulgara on~Karara Karara~where there has
  been no introduced predator control, and compare results with Matuwa.
\item
  Continue to implement the fire management plan including buffer
  burning and aerial patch burning. Carry out patch-burning in the
  predator-proof compound.
\end{itemize}
