\section*{Management of invertebrate pests in forests of south-west Western
Australia
}

J Farr, A Wills


\section*{Context}
Within the history of forest and natural landscape management in Western
Australia, many invertebrates are known to utilise forest biomass for
their survival and in doing so impart some form of damage to leaves,
shoot, roots, stems or branches. There are 10 recognised invertebrate
species with demonstrated significant impact on tree health, vitality
and timber quality within our natural environment. Currently the most
prevalent insect pests of concern in native forests are \emph{Perthida
glyphopa} (jarrah leafminer, JLM), \emph{Phoracantha acanthocera}
(bullseye borer, formerly known as \emph{Tryphocaria acanthocera} BEB)
and \emph{Uraba lugens} (gumleaf skeletoniser, GLS). Both JLM and GLS
have documented population outbreak periods, and BEB incidence appears
to be responsive to drought stress and is likely to increase. However,
Western Australian forests and woodlands also have a history of
developing unexpected insect outbreaks with dramatic consequences for
the ecosystem health and vitality. The decline in mean annual rainfall
in south-west Western Australia since the 1970s and global climate model
predictions of a warmer and drier environment mean conditions for
invertebrate pests will alter significantly in the next decade as our
environment shifts toward a new climatic regime. This project addresses
both recognised and emerging/potential invertebrate forest pests, and is
designed to augment forest health surveillance and management
requirements by providing knowledge on the biological aspects of forest
health threats from invertebrates in the south-west of Western
Australia.



\section*{Aims}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Investigate aspects of pest organism biology, host requirements,
  pathology and environmental conditions (including climatic conditions)
  that influence populations.
\item
  Determine distribution of the invertebrate pests, including outbreak
  boundaries and advancing outbreak fronts, using aerial mapping, remote
  sensing and road surveys.
\item
  Measure relative abundance of invertebrate pests, including
  quantitative population surveys and host/environmental impact studies
  where appropriate and/or possible.
\item
  Utilise appropriate monitoring technologies including GIS and remote
  sensing.
\item
  Liaise with land managers and the community regarding responses to
  pest insect outbreaks.
\end{itemize}



\section*{Progress}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Pheromone trapping of GLS was used to quantify the 2014/15 GLS
  population level.
\item
  More than 250,000 ha of forest was defoliated by GLS in 2010/2011. GLS
  populations have since decreased from this peak. GLS population
  changes indicate density dependent mortality is operating in this
  population decline. The mechanism of density dependent mortality is
  not yet understood.
\item
  The relationship between November and January populations of GLS
  larvae was investigated to allow integration of historical and current
  monitoring data.
\item
  A report summarising results of GLS monitoring 2010-2014 has been
  prepared and circulated to managers.
\item
  A science information sheet describing the link between GLS outbreak
  and anomalously low rainfall has been prepared.
\item
  \emph{Cardiaspina fiscella} incidences are increasing in south-west WA
  and a science information sheet describing the behaviour of this pest
  insect is being prepared.
\end{itemize}



\section*{Management implications}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Pheromone trapping is effective in monitoring GLS populations and
  could be used routinely to identify the likelihood of GLS outbreak.
  Moth populations are a good predictor of subsequent larval populations
  and may provide early warning of outbreak events.
\item
  Integration of GLS population and impact data from two major outbreak
  events will facilitate analysis of links between climatic factors and
  outbreak development. Preliminary analysis indicates a strong coupling
  between GLS outbreak and periods of below-normal rainfall at annual or
  longer timescales.
\end{itemize}



\section*{Future directions}
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Refine relationship between moths captures and Normalized Difference
  Vegetation Index to investigate the spatial structure of the onset and
  development of GLS outbreaks and the relationship between defoliation
  rates and leaf area index.
\item
  Finalise and publish findings from investigations of long term
  population cycles of GLS.
\end{itemize}
