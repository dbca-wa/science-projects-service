\section*{South West Wetlands Monitoring Program (SWWMP)
}

J Lane, M Lyons, A Pinder, A Clarke, D Cale, Y Winchcombe



\section*{Context}

Substantial decline in wetland condition has been observed across the
south-west of Western Australia over the past 100 years, particularly in
the Wheatbelt, almost certainly with ongoing loss of biodiversity. The
most pronounced changes to wetlands have been associated with
salinisation and altered hydrology following clearing of native
vegetation in catchments. Broad-scale clearing has largely ceased but
hydrological and fragmentation processes will continue to be expressed
for many decades. Changes in rainfall patterns are also resulting in
significant changes to wetland hydrology, water chemistry and habitats.

While it is known that altered hydrological regimes and salinisation are
major threats to wetland biodiversity, the relationships between
physical expression and loss of biodiversity are poorly documented and
poorly understood. Monitoring of wetland depth and water chemistry in
the south-west began in 1977 to inform duck hunting management. After
continuing at a reduced level following the ban on recreational duck
hunting in 1992, the program was reinvigorated under the State Salinity
Strategy in 1996, supplemented by intensive monitoring of fauna, flora,
water chemistry and shallow groundwater at a subset of 25 wetlands. This
project is delivering vital information on the long-term trends and
variability in key determinants of wetland character and condition and,
to a lesser extent, biological attributes.




\section*{Aims}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  To contribute to improved decision making in wetland biodiversity
  conservation by 1) providing analyses of long and short-term changes
  in surface water quantity and quality, shallow groundwater levels and
  biodiversity at representative south-west wetlands in relation to
  threatening processes (particularly dryland salinity and reduced
  rainfall) and 2) assessing the effectiveness of catchment and wetland
  management.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Progress}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Depth and water quality monitoring was undertaken at 105 wetlands.
\item
  Additional monitoring was undertaken following exceptional rains in
  February.
\item
  Continuous water level and rain gauges were maintained on 10 southern
  wetlands with high conservation values. A report on such data from 14
  wetlands was completed.
\item
  The 1977-2015 SWWMP report was completed and key results communicated
  to managers.
\item
  The final report on changes in waterbird usage and habitats of 11
  mainly south coast wetlands, between the 1980s and 2008-2011, was
  completed.
\item
  The `Salinity profiling of Lake Jasper in November 2015' report was
  completed to provide a broader context for recent changes in salinity
  at the single monitoring point.
\item
  Water level monitoring of the Vasse and Wonnerup estuaries and the
  Lower Vasse River Wetlands continued.
\item
  Landsat shortwave infrared data was used to model depth to assist in
  filling gaps in the 40 year SWWMP depth records.
\item
  Analyses of relationships between wetland character and aquatic fauna
  based on the Wheatbelt monitoring project largely completed.
\item
  Following the first major fill event in more than 20 years, aquatic
  invertebrates and waterbirds were surveyed at Lake Toolibin.
\item
  Data analysis for dominant overstorey trees commenced on Wheatbelt
  wetlands.
\item
  Groundwater data collection was undertaken in autumn 2016.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Management implications}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Rainfall and water levels in south-western Australia are declining
  with adverse implications for wetland flora and fauna (such as the
  threatened Australasian bittern) and for the recreational value of
  wetlands.
\item
  The SWWMP project provides early warnings of changes in three critical
  determinants of wetland ecological character (depth, salinity, pH) and
  helps inform where to focus management. The long-term nature of this
  project provides a unique context against which to assess the
  significance of contemporary observations and enables prediction of
  the effects of threatening processes and wetland management.
\item
  SWWMP data provides vital information for planning and assessing
  management interventions, such as the hydrological interventions to
  reduce water levels in the Warden (Esperance) Ramsar wetlands,
  increase water levels at Jandabup and Thomsons Lakes and depths for
  water skiing at Lake Towerinning.
\item
  Analyses of flora and fauna from representative wetlands will allow
  managers to predict future impacts of altered hydrology, assess
  management responses and understand the trajectory of Wheatbelt
  wetland biodiversity generally. Communities in representative
  Wheatbelt wetlands are not undergoing strong directional change at
  present, but their responses to rainfall predicts that longer-term
  shifts can be expected.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Future directions}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Complete write-up of the 15 years of fauna and flora monitoring at the
  intensively monitored wetlands and archive data.
\item
  Re-focus the biological monitoring program to a smaller set of high
  conservation value south-west wetlands with current or imminent
  threats and clear management questions.
\item
  By interpolation and modelling, fill gaps in the SWWMP water level
  time series to substantially increase the number of wetlands that can
  be included in decadal and multi-decadal trend analyses. Use this
  information plus an extra five years data to update the 1981-2010
  analyses of region-wide trends in rainfall and wetland depths as a
  journal article.
\item
  Complete preparation of the~1977-2016 annual SWWMP report, presenting
  routinely recorded depth, salinity and pH measurements.
\item
  Update~the 2009-2015 continuous water level and rainfall recordings
  report to 2016.
\item
  Use results of long-term periodic water level, salinity and pH
  monitoring, continuous on-site rainfall and water level monitoring,
  and other datasets, to predict likely futures of wetlands important
  for Australasian bittern and other fauna and flora under different
  climate scenarios.
\end{itemize}
