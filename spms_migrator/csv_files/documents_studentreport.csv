1079,2014,"<p>Overall, a total of 66 cats (30 male and 36 female) and 101 rats (47 males, 53 females and one not recorded) collected from Christmas Island have been necropsied and samples collected for further testing. A high prevalence of parasitic infection was found in these hosts with greater than 84% of both cats and rats found to be harbouring at least one parasite species and up to six (for cats) and seven (for rats) different parasite species (total infracommunity richness, ICR). Overall, 18 different helminth genera were represented, with a local richness of 10 species identified in cats (representing four Phyla; Nematoda, Cestoda, Trematoda, and Acanthocephala) and 12 species identified in rats (three Phyla; Nematoda, Cestoda, and Acanthocephala). The local richness and total infracommunity richness found in this study is higher than expected. This is due to the island syndrome which dictates that island communities should typically have a high prevalence but a low richness of parasite species due to the founder effect. However this study has found an unusually high local and infracommunity richness, the reasons of which are still to be elucidated.</p>
<p>This study detected no significant correlations with body condition and parasite community ecology in cats; however overall presence of parasites and total infracommunity richness is found to be significantly correlated with body condition in rats. Gender was also found to play a role in parasite community ecology with female cats being more likely to harbour a greater total and visceral infracommunity richness as well as intensity of the bile duct fluke, <em>Platynosomum concinnum</em>. In opposition to this male rats were more likely to have a high intensity of the tapeworm, <em>Taenia taeniaeformis</em>. In addition to a high number of parasites that have a potential conservation and zoonotic significance, this study also expands the geographic range of eight parasite species as well as the discovery of a potentially novel Spirurid species in rats. These results indicate that a suite of parasites were inadvertently introduced to Christmas Island along with the introduction of both cats and rats. A number of these parasites require suitable intermediate hosts to persist and given the paucity of mammalian species on Christmas Island, we need to consider the involvement of alternative host species in maintaining transmission cycles. Molecular screening of tissue samples for <em>Leptospira</em> spp. in both cats and rats is due to be performed shortly. Screening is also underway for the presence of feline and rodent <em>Hepatozoon</em> spp. and piroplasms e.g. <em>Babesia</em> spp. with preliminary screening producing positive results.</p>",1
1085,2014,"<p>Sandalwood oil is one of the world's most valuable essential oils. Western Australian sandalwood, <em>Santalum spicatum</em>, is one of seven commercially valuable sandalwood species well known for its pleasant fragrance and importance to many Asian cultures. <em>S. spicatum</em> is currently harvested from natural stands and, due to past exploitation combined with slow regeneration and habitat loss, there is concern over the sustainable management of this species. Plantation production alleviates pressure from natural populations and ensures a sustainable supply of sandalwood in the future. Mature heartwood of <em>S. spicatum</em> contains a diverse array of cyclic and acyclic terpenoid skeletons, including bergamotene, farnesene, santalenes and the highly sought after fragrance ingredients, the santalols. Oil production is not consistent with either heartwood yield or composition, so the current research attempts to better understand this variation by investigating the natural genetic and chemical diversity, genes involved in oil biosynthesis, and the different environments in which <em>S. spicatum</em> grows in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Several P450 candidates have been selected from genomic libraries derived from <em>S. album</em> and <em>S. spicatum</em> wood tissue and tested in a yeast system that has successfully produced the santalol precursors in vivo. A 454 library for <em>S. spicatum</em> has been constructed to enable further characterisation of genes in order to advance plantation development through improved selection and to reduce strains on natural populations. This gene-mining approach has enabled the characterisation of a fourth terpene synthase (TPS) from <em>S. spicatum</em> and identification of four new TPS genes. A chemotaxonomic investigation of approximately 200 individuals distributed throughout the Wheatbelt (predominantly), Goldfields, Shark Bay and Carnarvon has been completed to identify specific chemotypes. Results suggest chemical diversity within and between regions, with some individuals exhibiting high santalol and low farnesol content, an undesirable constituent. An &alpha;-bisabolol chemotype may be present in the Goldfields as well as an &alpha;-santalol chemotype in northern trees. For these individuals, genetic analyses using microsatellite data are being applied to aid understanding of the genetic structure of this species and the relationship to heartwood oil content. Results confirm previous studies on the presence of two genetic groups of <em>S. spicatum</em> in the arid north and semi-arid south-west. Environmental data, including host species and distances, tree height, diameter, soil type and pH and rainfall have been collected from the field to carry out statistical analysis to identify any significant relationships between oil yield and composition, genetics and these various environmental factors. Statistical results thus far have identified santalol and farnesol as two key components driving the variability in heartwood chemistry, which is important for future breeders who wish to select trees with high santalol content and conversely low farnesol content. A relationship between genetic distance and oil composition was also found, indicating a geographic component to oil composition. Results of the studies will be applied to the future conservation of <em>S. spicatum</em>, improvement of plantation management with the potential of metabolic engineering of desirable oil constituents in vitro.</p>",1
1086,2014,"<p>Species with restricted distributions, known as short-range endemics (SREs) are more susceptible to extinction than those that occupy a wide range and variety of habitats. The Yilgarn Banded Iron Formations (BIF; 500km north-east of Perth) are biodiversity hotspots that harbour many SREs. This project will examine the genetic diversity and structure present in three, co-occurring Yilgarn SREs in order to determine their evolutionary history and to identify regions of high genetic diversity and therefore conservation significance.</p>
<p>Genetic data, using selected chloroplast DNA markers, indicated low genetic diversity and some genetic structuring in both plant species. Nuclear data in <em>B. arborea</em> is also indicating low levels of genetic variation and structure. Results for the millipede <em>A. bamfordi</em> using selected mitochondrial DNA markers indicated genetic structuring across BIF ranges, with a pattern indicative of an historical vicariance event leading to isolation of BIF populations during the mid-Pleistocene around one million years before present. Both mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers show higher genetic diversity in the large, more topographically complex BIFs and this has significant conservation implications for the future management of the species. This project has now been completed and a PhD thesis submitted.</p>",1
1090,2014,"<p>The aim of this study was to determine the trophic role of pomacentrid fishes as herbivores on temperate algal-dominated reefs, with a particular focus on the abundant species <em>Parma mccullochi</em>. The study was undertaken in Marmion Marine Park and determined the diet of this species, including ontogenetic changes, and the impact of grazing by pomacentrids on algal production and the composition of temperate reef algal communities.</p>
<p><em>Parma mccullochi</em> was found to be a strict herbivore, feeding almost entirely on foliose and filamentous red algae and the diets of juvenile and adult fish did not differ. Electivity indices indicated that <em>P. mccullochi</em> specifically selected these algaes. Macroalgae differed significantly inside and outside <em>P. mccullochi</em> territories and a caging experiment in territories indicated a moderate effect on the composition of recruiting algae.</p>
<p>This thesis successfully passed examination and a paper titled 'The territorial herbivorous fish <em>Parma mccullochi</em> (Pomacentridae) strongly influences algal assemblages in temperate reefs' is currently in review at <em>Marine Ecology Progress Series</em>.</p>",1
1091,2014,"<p>Little is known about herbivory by fishes in temperate reefs and even less about the species that play an important role in this process. Kyphosids are an abundant family of herbivorous fishes widely distributed in the southern hemisphere, and especially in both temperate and tropical waters of Australia; however, the ecology of these fishes in temperate latitudes is poorly understood. The aim of this project is to determine the role of kyphosids in algal herbivory in reef ecosystems, and the factors affecting their grazing activity.</p>
<p>Field studies in Marmion and Ningaloo marine parks have now been completed, as have pilot studies on how to best survey kyphosids and assess their diets. A quantitative study of habitat use has been completed and all fishes required for laboratory work in the study have been collected. These fishes are currently being processed to compile data sets on morphology and diet.</p>",1
1094,2014,"<p>Vertebrate fauna translocations, particularly to mainland sites, have a low rate of success (&lt;30%). One potentially contributing factor that has been poorly studied is the impact of parasite loads and pathogenic disease in founder individuals during the stressful establishment period. Each individual carries many species of ectoparasite, enteric parasites and haemoparasites, which may impact directly or indirectly on the host or other species in the environment of the establishing population. For example, blood parasites in the <em>Trypanosoma</em> group have been closely associated with the decline of the woylie, <em>Bettongia penicillata</em>. This work aims to assess the survivorship impacts of disease and parasite load within the establishing population of golden bandicoots (<em>Isoodon auratus</em>) and boodies (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) during the first 18 months of translocation.</p>
<p>We experimentally manipulated the population by regularly dosing half the animals with a broad spectrum antiparasitic treatment in order to disrupt the life cycles of a variety of ecto, enteric and haemoparasites. During this intensive monitoring, other demographic and life history data were collected, as well as biological samples such as blood, DNA and faecal samples. Progress to date includes longitudinal trapping and data collection following the release of 160 golden bandicoots from Barrow Island and 170 boodies from Dryandra and Barrow Island. Approximately 800 blood samples were analysed for species-specific detection of <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em> and <em>T. vegrandis</em>. Ectoparasites were identified to species level to determine whether there has been a change in species diversity in the new environment, and to determine the effectiveness of the antiparasitic treatment. Presence of these trypanosomes and ectoparasites were added to models of survivorship to determine if there was a relationship, as well as to follow the pattern of infection across the population. Skeletal and mass measurements, body condition and fecundity of golden bandicoots released at Lorna Glen and Hermite Island were compared to long-term monitoring data from the source population. Upon establishment at both new sites, translocated males increased in condition (i.e. body mass but not skeletal size) and females showed an increased reproductive output. Bandicoots born at translocation sites were significantly larger and heavier (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.0001 respectively) than the founders from the island population within 18 months of establishment. This change in skeletal size, mass and fecundity took place in a single generation at both mainland and island translocation sites, suggesting that the response is not one of evolution by natural selection. This study demonstrated that the small size of golden bandicoots on Barrow Island is not a genotypic response to selective pressures, but rather a phenotypic response to conditions on the island. When translocated to vacant ecological niches, they have the capacity to produce offspring with increased body mass, size and reproductive output. We suggest that ecological processes relating to resource limitation drive 'island dwarfism' in <em>I. auratus</em>.</p>

1095,2014,"<p>This project investigates genetic factors that will contribute to improved fauna translocation success.</p>
<p>Investigation of the fine-scale genetic structure of a mainland dibbler (<em>Parantechinus apicalis</em>) population in and around Fitzgerald River National Park (FRNP) using spatial autocorrelation suggests a significant relationship between genetic and geographic distances between trapping locations. Dibblers located at least 20km away were less likely to be related than dibblers found within 20km.</p>
<p>Genetic and demographic data are being assessed in dibblers from the translocated Escape population, Boullanger population and Whitlock population. Genetic data has been collected, and demographic data of the Boullanger and Whitlock populations are being gathered from the past records.</p>
<p>The animals for the dibbler translocation to Escape Island were sourced from populations on Boullanger and Whitlock islands that are genetically distinct and have slightly different body sizes. Genetic analysis show evidence of genetic mixing which started from the captive bred colony and continued in the Escape population. However, the mixing seemed to bias toward the Boullanger ancestor, and appears to be size related. Females were observed to preferred heavier males. A low effective population size of approximately eight dibblers was estimated from the genotypic data. Morphological comparisons between different offspring groups, after taking gender differences into account, showed no significant differences except for the head length. However, the sample size was small. Population viability analysis suggested the Escape population will persist for another 70 years. A supplementation as low as seven pairs of dibblers every 10 years can prolong population's persistence.</p>
<p>Investigation of a burrowing bettong translocation to where animals were derived from two genetically and morphologically distinct source populations, Barrow Island and Dorre Island, showed evidence of genetic mixing. The new population had higher genetic diversity in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA than its parental populations. However, the results suggested a genetic bias toward larger Dryandra bettongs. Based on mtDNA, 70% of interbred offspring were born from Dryandra mothers and Barrow Island fathers. This suggested that the uneven founder proportion from each source population may influence the genetic bias. Offspring morphology showed a positive relationship between the offspring body size and the parental genetic percentage, where the interbred offspring were larger than expected.</p>",1
1106,2014,"<p>The functioning of fish assemblages rests mainly on the trophic status of species. Gut content analyses provide insight into feeding behaviours and lead to better understanding of the complex interactions between fish species. Mesopredators are common on coral reefs and fluctuations in their abundance may influence prevalence of prey. However, there is a lack of information on mesopredator diets, making it difficult to assess how changes in their abundance will influence prey, reef trophodynamics and ecology.</p>
<p>This study examined the gut content of four mesopredator species: <em>Epinephelus rivulatus</em>, <em>Parapercis clathrata</em>, <em>Pseudochromis fuscus</em> and <em>Synodus dermatogenys</em>. Mobile benthic invertebrates, particularly decapods, were the main item in the diet of three mesopredator species. However, one species, <em>S. dermatogenys</em>, fed exclusively on other fish species. A manuscript based on this work has been published in the <em>Journal of Fish Biology.</em></p>",1
1096,2014,"<p>To assess natural recruitment success amongst species and better inform translocation success criteria, seedling growth and mortality was monitored at three burnt sites, over two seasons, for a range of <em>Acacia</em> and <em>Banksia</em> species. Further investigation of translocation success criteria was carried out through experimental translocations of Critically Endangered <em>Banksia ionthocarpa</em> ssp. <em>ionthocarpa</em> and <em>Acacia awestoniana</em>. In <em>Banksia ionthocarpa</em> ssp. <em>ionthocarpa</em> survival of seedlings after two years was high at 75%, with seedlings in plots that were automatically watered weekly during summer showing increased survival and enhanced growth when compared with seedlings that were manually watered once a month. Of three different microhabitats seedlings had higher survival and grew most in the low heath plots. In <em>Acacia awestoniana</em> survival of seedlings after two years was very high at 81%, with treatments not showing significant differences with respect to survival, although there were substantial differences in terms of growth. Plants that were watered weekly or monthly during summer showed enhanced growth when compared to non-watered plants. A PhD thesis has been submitted.</p>",1
1098,2014,"<p>This project aimed to determine if there is regional variation in the understorey of <em>Eucalyptus salmonophloia</em> woodlands across the Great Western Woodlands (GWW) and, if so, what environmental factors were influencing it. The project then integrated relevant existing survey data from across the Wheatbelt to assess the variation across the two bioregions in which salmon gum woodlands occur, Avon-Wheatbelt and Coolgardie. This project fills large gaps in the floristic surveys of the GWW, which have previously focused on the banded ironstone and greenstone ranges. One hundred sites were sampled in spring 2011 and 2012, in old growth woodlands or woodlands where the timber cutting and/or grazing history could be estimated. Data was collected on species composition, cover and height, tree dimensions, site-based variables, and soil physical and chemical characteristics. Detailed classification and ordination of the data revealed two main communities; one with an understorey of mainly chenopod species on soils higher in clay found in the drier north and east of the GWW, and the other with non-chenopod species (e.g. <em>Eremophila</em> spp., <em>Acacia</em> spp., <em>Scaevola spinescens</em> and <em>Alyxia buxifolia</em>) found on sandier soils in the wetter south and west. Precipitation, monthly precipitation variability and temperature, and to a lesser extent soil phosphorous, pH, silt content, and cover of organic crust influenced the patterns in floristic composition and differentiated between the two main communities. When data from the Wheatbelt was incorporated the two GWW communities remained prominent and were joined by two Wheatbelt communities and one community (with <em>Melaleuca pauperiflora</em>) that traversed the two regions. Across this larger area the influence of the annual precipitation gradient and ratio of summer to winter rainfall (less in the east) was strong. Generally regional factors (such as climate) were more influential on the floristic patterns that local (such as soil) factors. This project has contributed to knowledge about these woodlands relevant to their conservation status, delineation of subregional boundaries and land management activities. The salmon gum - chenopod shrublands burn less frequently as they are less flammable and have a more sparse cover that the salmon gum - eremophila woodlands which are experiencing fire more frequently and consequently being reduced in extent. Vouchers for all species collected will be lodged in the Perth Herbarium and the field data will be lodged with TERN-&AElig;KOS.</p>",1
1099,2014,"<p>This project aims to: i) determine if a reliable estimate of quokka abundance can be obtained from indicators of activity including scats, tracks and runnels; ii) identify the preferred habitat of quokka in southern forests; iii) determine the mobility and activity patterns of quokka in the southern forests; iv) identify the influence of fire on distribution and abundance of quokka in the southern forests; and v) in collaboration with others determine whether the sub-populations constitute a functional meta-population. Occupancy models were generated from presence/absence data and have identified the density of the near-surface fuel layer, vegetation structure and proximity to a different fuel age as the subset of variables that best predict the probability of occupancy of habitat by quokka. Associated monitoring by cage and camera trapping indicates that feral cats were responsible for almost complete recruitment failure over a four year period due to predation of young immediately after pouch emergence.</p>
<p>Home range and movement patterns have been investigated using 29 collared quokkas and results indicate a mean home range of 71ha (core range 18ha) with movements averaging between 0.4 and 2.4km/night. Largest movements were recorded in summer and autumn and were linked to requirements to forage further afield for water and food during hot dry conditions. Collared animals spent 40% of their time in riparian habitat within a stable home range and emigrating individuals travelled distances of up to 14.2km, using riparian vegetation as corridors. Forest areas with fire treatment and comparable unburnt sites have been examined for quokka abundance and habitat quality pre- and post-fire to determine the effect of fire on habitat use and the time taken for habitat to become re-colonised post-fire. DNA has been provided to staff at Murdoch University, who will be assisting with DNA processing. A paper presenting an effective and efficient survey method for quokka has been published.</p>",1

1104,2014,"<p>This project investigated the nesting ecology and post-nesting migration phase of hawksbill turtles in the Northern Territory, using on-ground surveys and satellite telemetry at Groote Eylandt. Specific aspects of the project involved estimating the size of the annual nesting population, determining nesting seasonality, assessing mortality on the beach, mapping inter-nesting habitat and post-nesting migration routes and describing dive behaviour and in-water habitat use.</p>
<p>This project has extended our understanding of hawksbill turtle biology and ecology in the areas of nesting biology, identification and description of critical habitats during the inter-nesting, post-nesting and foraging phases of life history, and understanding migration and diving behaviour. It was confirmed that Groote Eylandt is a nationally significant rookery for hawksbill turtles and previously unidentified foraging habitat in the Gulf of Carpentaria was identified. This project is now completed. One paper has been published and three more are to be submitted.</p>",1
1105,2014,"<p>This project is designed to investigate the resilience of sea turtles in relation to climate change. Sea turtles are reliant on relatively narrow temperature ranges for incubation of eggs and also sex determination of the embryos. Higher or lower temperatures can lead to mortality of the embryos and changes within these ranges can lead to sex biases. Variation within and between turtle species will be determined through gene expression in temperature-sensitive genes. A major objective is to determine if the differential expression of specific genetic markers can be used as proxies for estimating the tolerance of marine turtle embryos to extreme temperatures. More specifically, this project will investigate whether there is phenotypic variation within and between species, and at what pace thermal tolerance may evolve. The work will primarily be undertaken on flatback turtles and loggerhead turtles. Field work for this project has been completed and data is being analysed.</p>",1
1107,2014,"<p>The overall aim of this study is to determine whether periodically fished areas (tabu) can successfully protect locally targeted reef fish assemblages and how the intensity of harvest events impacts on their effectiveness.

Using the results from this study and others in the region, a meta-analysis will be done that will examine whether tabu areas are a successful fisheries management tool that can provide a viable alternative to permanent marine reserves by either maintaining or increasing local fish stocks. This information will assist with the formation of a set of guidelines that provide advice to local communities on how to manage these tabu areas.</p>

1113,2014,"<p>Western Australian salt lake systems have very high rates of endemism within their flora and aquatic invertebrate fauna. This has largely been revealed through morphological taxonomic studies across fairly limited geographic extents. <em>Parartemia</em> brine shrimp are an important component of Western Australian salt lake systems and this endemic genus represents a greater concentration of brine shrimp diversity in Western Australia than anywhere else in the world. Many <em>Parartemia</em> species appear to be restricted in distribution while others are apparently widespread (at least based on morphological identifications), occurring across multiple isolated salt lake systems. This project aims to investigate whether these widespread species represent single genetic lineages (indicating regular dispersal, e.g. by waterbirds, wind-blown eggs or flooding) or a series of spatially restricted ones. The project will also investigate levels of genetic diversity within salt lakes and the levels of connectivity between populations at various scales. This knowledge will contribute to planning for the conservation of salt lake biodiversity by elucidating the spatial scales which are relevant to the conservation of salt lake systems.</p>
<p>Samples of three species of <em>Parartemia</em> from the Esperance region have been collected. Over 100 potential microsatellite loci from <em>P. informis</em> were identified and tested for suitability for population genetic studies of selected species. Amplification of COI and 16S regions of the mtDNA from selected species of <em>Parartemia</em> was tested.</p>
<p>Assessment of mitochondrial and especially microsatellite markers, proved to be difficult for <em>Parartemia</em>. All attempts to amplify microsatellite loci from any of the <em>Parartemia</em> species collected were unsuccessful. One set of 16S primer designed in the study was able to amplify a small number of <em>P. longicaudata</em> from two locations about 340km apart.</p>
<p>Preliminary genetic results and analysis showed that although the specimens were morphologically similar, they had very divergent 16S haplotypes (7.8 - 9% sequence divergence) and formed separate groups in a haplotype network and phylogenetic tree. However, the amount of divergence between specimens from the same site was very small (0.6 - 1.1%). This might indicate that the morphospecies <em>P. longicaudata</em>, might actually comprise two or more cryptic species.</p>",1
1100,2014,"<p>This project aims to investigate the biodiversity and ecological impact of ectoparasites across a range of threatened mammalian hosts in Western Australia. Mammals from diverse environments including islands, south-western forests and semi-arid regions were sampled in different seasons from 2006 to 2010. The ectoparasite fauna from a variety of threatened mammalian species were sampled and in most cases identified to species level using existing keys. A literature review was conducted and new host-parasite lists constructed for animals including woylies and boodies (<em>Bettongia</em> species), <em>Rattus fuscipes</em>, quenda (<em>Isoodon obesulus</em>), golden bandicoot (<em>Isoodon auratus</em>) and common brushtail possum (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>). A putative new species of <em>Ixodes</em> tick found on the woylie was examined using light microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy.

1110,2014,"<p>On-going climate change through the 21st century projects increasingly warmer and drier conditions for Mediterranean type ecosystems (MTEs), creating threats to species persistence in these biodiversity hotspots. For the highly biodiverse kwongan of south-west Australia, this means a climate shifting towards semi-arid conditions, yet how this unique vegetation type will respond to a novel hotter and drier climate is largely unknown. Therefore, this study examined the effects of altered rainfall and temperature on demographic processes of woody kwongan in post-fire (0-3 years since last fire) and mature (12 - 15 years since last fire) stands across a soil depth gradient in the northern sandplains of south-western Australia, seeking to identify the consequences for plant species and functional trait composition. To achieve this, a selection of commonly occurring species (<em>Banksia attenuata</em>, <em>Banksia hookeriana</em>, <em>Melaleuca leuropoma</em> and <em>Beaufortia elegans</em> as primary focal species) were used to form a plant functional trait scheme, with fire-response strategy (resprouter, non-resprouter) as a trait of key interest due to the fire prone nature of MTEs, and leaf type (broad, needle, small), growth form (shrub, subshrub) and seed size (large, medium, small) as traits of interest due to their potential roles in drought and temperature responses. Passive rainout shelters were used to reduce rainfall, and drip irrigation to increase rainfall, by ~30 %. Open top chambers were used to increase temperature, with daytime temperature increased by an average of 2.9&deg;C.</p>
<p>Seedling germination, survival and growth, and adult survival, health, flowering and fruiting were reduced by drought and warming, with increased rainfall producing little change. Greater magnitude of reduction was observed under experimental warming, however experimental drought resulted in greater degree change in functional trait composition. Despite the general higher resistance of adult resprouters, it was non-resprouters that showed potential to become the dominant fire-response strategy in a drier environment, through higher seedling resilience and similar resistance as adults to resprouters. With a decline in survival for both post-fire resprouts and seedlings, resprouters could be at risk of population decline in the long term. Subshrub and small leaf traits were the most successful in drought conditions due to their drought tolerant nature, while broad leaf and shrub traits will likely suffer population decline. In warmer conditions, significant decline in resprouter seedling survival was matched by equally large decline in non-resprouter adult survival, indicating little change in dominance of non-resprouters at the seedling stage and resprouters at the adult stage, and thus little change in their relative abundances. The needle leaf trait was most competitive in warmed conditions performing well relative to other traits both in seedlings and adults. Shallow soil profiles, reflecting lower water availability, negatively affected demographic rates, suggesting decreases in diversity and density on shallow soils as less drought tolerant species retreat to deeper soil profiles with greater water stores.</p>
<p>Results here show potential for large scale change in MTEs in projected warmer and drier climates, through decline in vulnerable functional traits, and thus reduced density of woody species and losses to biodiversity. Further investigation is needed into the combined effect of warming and drought, in addition to impact of altered fire regime, with changes in fire behaviour projected for MTEs as a result of warmer and drier conditions. Investigation that encompasses a broader range of Mediterranean species is also necessary to provide greater accuracy to conclusions drawn here on functional trait responses.</p>",1
1111,2014,"<p>This project assessed changes in biological soil crust cover and function (changes in nutrient dynamics) of gimlet (<em>Eucalyptus salubris</em>) woodlands over a multi-century time-since-fire chronosequence. Biological soil crusts are complex communities of soil inhabited by bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, lichen and bryophytes, and are important components of arid ecosystems worldwide. Disturbances such as wildfire may impact on crust composition, cover and function, but it is poorly known what these changes are and over what time scales crust communities recover after fire.</p>
<p>Changes in the composition and cover of biological soil crust communities occurred with time since fire. Lichen richness increased with time since fire, while bryophyte richness remained largely stable. Overall biological soil crust cover declined with time since fire, with a range of mosses contributing high cover in the immediate post-fire period. Like other biota, biological soil crust communities show distinct successional changes with time since fire in gimlet woodlands.</p>",1
1112,2014,"<p>Coral reefs are diverse, complex environments that support a wide array of fish assemblages and associated sea-scapes. Identifying the functional role of fish and understanding how they interact with other species is critical for the effective management and conservation of reef systems. Coral reef meso-predators maintain and regulate ecosystem dynamics, although it is often difficult to identify explicit trophic links between species due to the exceedingly complex nature of marine food webs. Consequently, the function of predators and meso-predators in coral reef ecosystems is often not apparent, and can be difficult to distinguish and define. By expanding our understanding of the functional and trophic role of meso-predators on coral reefs, we can predict not only their response to external factors such as climate change and overfishing, but their contribution to trophodynamics and energy flow in the ecosystem. Using an integrated approach, the project calculated turnover rates of several species of meso-predatory fish at Ningaloo Reef, providing estimates of how important these fish are in local food webs.</p>",1

The prevalence of parasitic infections varied among the study sites, with contrasting trypanosome prevalence observed from the two declining indigenous populations within the Upper Warren region in south-west Western Australia. Parasitaemia associated with trypanosome infection in the peripheral blood of the woylie exhibited a temporal decline as the infection progressed, being indicative of the infection transitioning between the acute and chronic phase. <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em> also exhibits a predilection for certain tissues of the host, where they can display <em>Trypanosoma</em> cruzi-like pathology at the time of autopsy. It appears that the chronic intracellular association of trypanosomes with the internal organs of the woylie may be potentially pathogenic and adversely affect the fitness and coordination of the woylie, making them more susceptible to predation, and contributing to the overall decline. Three scientific papers have been published, and one is in preparation.</p>",1
1116,2014,"<p>This project investigates if disease is a significant factor in the declines and lack of recovery of the woylie. Comparisons are made over time of the health and disease of woylies in three varying population management systems - wild, predator-free sanctuary and captive. Sampling from the Perup Sanctuary gives the opportunity to investigate and focus on the role of disease in the absence of introduced predators.</p>
<p>Health testing at these sites has been completed and included haematology, biochemistry, gastrointestinal parasite load, anti-oxidant and vitamin levels, and determination of stress levels using hair, faecal and serum cortisol. Screening for significant marsupial pathogens and diseases has included haemoparasites, toxoplasmosis and selected viruses (Wallal &amp; Warrego orbiviruses and macropodid herpesviruses). Significant progress has been made in the data analysis and writing up phases. Reference ranges for haematology and serum biochemistry are being established, and a journal paper on the findings of herpesvirus screening is underway.</p>",1
1117,2014,"<p>Prior to this study, limited data was available regarding the prevalence of <em>Blastocystis</em> in Australian native fauna. This study determined the prevalence and the genetic diversity of <em>Blastocystis</em> in wild native fauna in the south-west region of Western Australia. As part of this study, four species were examined for <em>Blastocystis</em> and four different genetic groups (subtypes) were found within these populations. Furthermore, a molecular tool was developed to screen samples for <em>Blastocystis</em>, <em>Giardia duodenalis</em> and <em>Cryptosporidium sp.</em> simultaneously. This multiplex PCR was tested against singleplex PCRs and microscopy. We have found this test to be equally sensitive or to have greater sensitivity than the singleplex PCR, and it has greater sensitivity and specificity than microscopy. Data collation and two publications are currently in preparation.</p>",1
1120,2014,"<p>Observed declines in coral cover are the result of environmental stressors, including increased sea surface temperatures, sedimentation, eutrophication, storms and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. These impacts are compounded at a site level through non-extractive recreational activities such as snorkelling, scuba diving and reef walking. Ningaloo Reef provides substantial opportunities for snorkelling and various recreational activities, which comes with the potential for direct physical damage to corals through trampling, fin contact, standing on corals and re-suspension of sediment. This study describes the spatial patterns and behaviour of snorkelers within a high-use site, Oyster Stacks, in Ningaloo Marine Park, using novel integration of GPS and GIS technologies. Fish observations and benthic analysis were also performed to determine substrate impacts from snorkelling activity by comparing high and low trafficked areas. The study concluded that snorkelling activity was not causing substantial ecological disturbance to the shallow water reef at Oyster Stacks. However, a community shift from a more fragile and dense habitat to a more sparse and robust community was noted. Proactive and adaptive management is recommended for Ningaloo Marine Park to help reduce the potential impacts on coral communities from snorkelling activity.</p>",1
1123,2014,"<p>A phylogenetic and phenetic assessment of genetic variation within and among species in the <em>Grevillea thelemanniana</em> subclade indicated that conservation listed taxa <em>G. delta</em>, <em>G. humifusa</em> and <em>G. thelemanniana</em> ssp.

More detailed landscape genetic studies on <em>G. thelemanniana</em> ssp.

1126,2014,"<p>The ecology and genetic structure in the Australian water rat is being investigated to provide information to support management. In total 94 samples were obtained from across PNG, Northern Territory, eastern Australia, the Kimberley, Shark Bay, south-west Western Australia and Barrow Island. This set broadly represented almost all of the species' distribution. Analysis of nuclear DNA using microsatellite markers has been completed and draft chapter is currently in review. Markers revealed significant regional genetic structure across species range, with particularly high levels of differentiation recorded in south-west Western Australia, Barrow Island and Tasmania compared to remainder of regions. This genetic divergence appears to matches phenotypes (defined by pelt colouration) observed in Barrow island and south-west Western Australian populations.</p>
<p>Where sample sizes were sufficient for within-region analysis, substantial genetic structure was found within south-west Western Australia and the lower Murray River / Adelaide region in South Australia. Significant structure was found within south-west Western Australia at fine spatial scales (&lt;30km), broadly correlated with hydrological catchments, and tributaries and dominant vegetation, with relationships to habitat connectivity. Results from Barrow Island indicate a highly inbred, insular population in low abundance.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for management and conservation of the species, particularly in Western Australia. The new information will contribute to resolve the species' taxonomic status - review of the taxonomic and conservation status particularly of south-west Western Australia and Barrow Island populations is required. The level of differentiation among populations needs to be taken into account in any translocation program.</p>",1
2782,2020,"<p class=""xmsonormal"">Tropical macroalgal meadows can cover extensive areas of the shallow seascape, providing habitat for an abundance of organisms. There is however a paucity of information on processes that drive distribution and structure of tropical macroalgal meadows, particularly how they respond to large-scale natural disturbances. To assess the effects of environmental disturbance on tropical macroalgae, this study will explore temporal and spatial patterns in community composition and physical structure of macroalgal assemblages at Ningaloo Marine Park. The project will analyse macroalgal data collected annually from the Ningaloo lagoon between February 2013 and February 2018, incorporating periods before and after tropical cyclone Olwyn (March 2015) and a major flood event (April 2014).</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">The study found the cover and height of canopy forming macroalgal fields was greater at sites in the southern part of Ningaloo Reef. Macroalgal diversity was also lower at southern sites compared to those in the north and central regions. Whilst there are temporal differences in macroalgal assemblages, these cannot be definitively linked to floods and cyclones. Further assessment of sites near Coral Bay in the southern region found canopy height and cover was greatest where density of urchins was low and sediment depth was high. Algae from the genera <em>Sargassopsis</em>, <em>Caulerpa</em>, <em>Hormophysa</em>, and <em>Sirophysalis</em> were more common at sites with more sediment.</p>",9
1276,2014,<p>This project will investigate possible associations between the population decline of the critically endangered woylie and the skin and fur conditions found on some individuals. Some woylies show skin alterations accompanied by fur loss. The causes for these changes remain unclear. In this project the data collected in the Upper Warren Region between November 2005 and April 2013 will be evaluated. Changes in the prevalence of these conditions and a possible correlation with survival rates and the population decline will be investigated.</p>,1
1278,2014,"<p>Infectious pathogens (e.g., <em>Trypanosoma</em> spp.) may play a role the recent &gt;90% declines of the woylie; thus, characterising factors influencing pathogen transmission is a priority and the focus of this project.</p>
<p>Research will occur in two semi-free-ranging populations near Perth (high density Karakamia Sanctuary and Whiteman Park, which will shift from high-to-low density due to enclosure expansion) and in free-ranging woylie populations in the Upper Warren region. At the <em>community</em> level, validated methods will be applied to identify and evaluate the prevalence of gastrointestinal and hemopathogens in woylies and sympatric marsupials. Multi-host (vector-borne, where applicable) transmission models will be used to evaluate the contribution of various co-host species to the basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>) of targeted pathogens. At the <em>population</em> level, woylies at Whiteman Park and Karakamia Sanctuary will be fitted with GPS collars to monitor movements; then social network analysis will be used to map pathogen transmission pathways and their relationship with density. These data will be used to develop networks that reflect potential transmission pathways for contagious, refuge-based, or environmental pathogens. In addition, the effects of translocation will be assessed by looking at members of the donor and recipient woylie populations before, during, and after translocation. Finally, at the <em>individual</em> level, screening for pathogens while assessing health, reproduction, and behavioural attributes will allow assessment of risk factors and potential fitness effects of pathogens in isolation or combination. Furthermore, network transmission models can facilitate the identification of behavioural traits (e.g., connectedness) or demographic factors (e.g., age, sex) key to pathogen propagation.</p>
<p>In this first year of the project, collection of field data has begun, with successful sampling at all sites and collar deployment at the two northern sites. Data collection will continue through 2015, as well as initial laboratory and data analysis.</p>",1
1078,2014,"<p>Biodiversity is not only threatened by habitat loss, climate change and pollution, but also through the threat from invasive species. The impact of introduced species is immense and causes substantial ecological and economical costs worldwide. With the start of domestications of the African wildcat (<em>Felis lybica</em>) in the Near East, the transport of house cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) around the world as commensals and domesticates commenced. The general aim of the thesis was to investigate the impact of invasive feral cats as well as underlying population genetic structures, diversity and phylogeography in the context of the demographic history in Australia and Hawaii. Studies confirmed that the main introductions of cats to Australia began in the 19th century via ships of European settlers, traders and workers. Similarly, the research confirmed cat introductions to Hawai'i by European traders and explorers, which has had devastating effects on Hawaiian endemic species.</p>
<p>Population genetic approaches are able to give insights into population genetic structure diversity and kinship, thereby enabling individually adapted control efforts to be more cost effective and successful. A lack of isolation by distance between populations of Hawai'i and Australia indicated that trade routes, such as the 'Golden Round' of the maritime fur trade, enabled an association between far off global cat populations. Multiple introductions to Australia and intermixing with domestic breed cats resulted in feral cat populations that show no signs of reduced genetic variability. This study also revealed the advantages of bioproxies in combination with phylogeography enabling inference and reconstruction of introduction routes, history and origin of invasive species. Genetic signals of historically introduced genotypes are still discernible on islands with low number of introductions over time and thereby low intermixing with domestic fancy breeds. Feral cats' adaptability as an invader was reconfirmed and possible underlying genetic mechanisms enabling their success as a global invader ('global supercat') were discussed. Research into the feralisation process of cats will provide new information regarding the domestication of cats, the genetic basis of feralisation and allow additional insights into cats' adaptation potential.</p>

1092,2014,"<p>Weather is a primary driver of bushfire behaviour. Much of the science linking interactions between fire weather and fire behaviour was established in the 1960s and 1970s, but new advances in understanding and computer modelling capability provide the scope to better understand the interactions of weather and fire behaviour. Coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to capture feedback loops between the fire and the atmosphere, enabling better understanding of how a fire may modify the environment in which it is burning. This is of particular importance during large-scale, high-intensity bushfires. This project aims to explore the capabilities and applications of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by examining case studies of actual bushfires, and by running idealised simulations where the sensitivity response to different input variables can be tested. Case studies include forest and shrubland fires in southern Australia. A detailed technical report examining significant aspects of the behaviour of the Kangaroo Island bushfires of December 2007 has been published. A case study of unexpectedly severe fire behaviour during a prescribed burn in October 2010 at Layman block east of Margaret River was published in the <em>Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal</em>.</p>
<p>The WRF model has been used to investigate the effect of coupling between the fire and the atmosphere. This has been done by simulating the growth of well-documented fires with and without the coupling function in the WRF model being enabled. Clear differences in fire behaviour have been observed between these contrasting model runs, and differences are consistent with known fire behaviour phenomena. A paper describing simulations of the 2007 D'Estrees fire is in review with the <em>Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology</em>, and two manuscripts are in review with the <em>International Journal of Wildland Fire</em>. A PhD thesis was submitted to the University of Adelaide in May 2014.</p>",1

1295,2014,"<p>The <em>Tetratheca hirsuta</em> auth. complex is the last remaining unresolved complex in the endemic Australian genus <em>Tetratheca</em>. The complex comprises the highly variable <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, as well as two phrase-named, conservation priority taxa <em>T</em>. sp. Boonanarring and <em>T</em>. sp. Granite. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether <em>T</em>.sp. Boonanarring and <em>T</em>.sp. Granite warrant formalisation as taxa distinct from <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, and if so, at what rank. As part of the resolution of the species complex, the study also aimed to test Thompson's (1976) assertion that individuals with large leaves and straight white stem hairs are <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em> rather than the sister species of the complex, <em>T</em>.<em> hispidissima</em>. An integrative approach incorporating morphometric multivariate analysis, Elliptic Fourier Analysis of leaf shapes, and phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast (<em>ndhF-trnL</em>,<em> rpl16</em>,<em> trnS-trnG5'2S</em>) and the nuclear ribosomal DNA region ETS was used to resolve taxonomic boundaries within the <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em> species complex. Morphological data show strong morphological divergence between <em>T.</em> sp. Boonanarring, and <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, and suggested that the morphological concept of <em>T.</em> sp. Granite should be expanded to include some morphotypes of <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>. In addition, morphological analysis indicated that individuals with large leaves and straight white stem hairs are more similar to <em>T</em>.<em> hispidissima</em> than to <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>. Phylogenetic analysis of the ETS region showed congruence with morphology, indicating that these morphological groups are also genetically divergent. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast regions yielded low resolution, perhaps due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgression. These results suggest that the groups of <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, <em>T</em>. sp. Boonanarring and an expanded concept of <em>T</em>. sp. Granite have morphologically and genetically diverged recently, and that they warrant formal recognition as distinct taxa at subspecies rank. Taxonomic resolution of the <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em> complex will help inform the conservation prioritization and subsequent management of these taxa and aid future research efforts on this complex and the wider flora of the South-west Australian Floristic Region.</p>",1
1102,2014,"<p>The aim of this study is to increase understanding of the role of the protozoan parasite <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> in wild woylie populations, particularly with regard to the recent population declines. <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em> can infect virtually any warm-blooded vertebrate, and has a worldwide distribution. In asymptomatic laboratory and wild rodents, <em>T. gondii</em> is reported to cause subtle changes in behaviour that may make infected hosts more susceptible to predation. In conjunction with the woylie project, we are also investigating mouse behaviour in response to <em>T. gondii</em> infection, particularly behaviours related to activity level, anxiety behaviour and cat urine avoidance behaviour.</p>
<p>If <em>T. gondii</em> alters the behaviour of woylies, this could predispose infected individuals to predation and increase mortality rates, thus contributing towards the decline of woylie populations. Serum samples collected by Department of Parks and Wildlife staff over the past six years will be analysed to determine <em>T. gondii</em> infection status. This will provide insights into the ecology of <em>T. gondii</em> infection in woylie populations and an opportunity to investigate whether this parasite alters woylie behaviour by correlating infection status with behavioural attributes. Three posters have been presented on this work at conferences and another is planned for later this year. One scientific journal article and one book chapter concerning the effect of <em>T. gondii</em> on host behaviour have been published so far.</p>",1
1109,2014,"<p>This thesis explored variation in commonly measured functional traits in populations of congeneric species (<em>Banksia baxteri, B. coccinea, B.</em> <em>media</em> and <em>B. quercifolia</em> R.Br.:Proteaceae) along a rainfall gradient in south-western Australia. A series of empirical studies examined the response of seed and seedlings of these obligate-seeding species to heat and/or drought stress. These investigations demonstrated the species- and population-specific nature of plant responses to gradients of environmental change. Some common responses occurred across experiments: cross-species patterns generally upheld along the gradient, but decoupling of patterns occurred at the local level. Against expectations, population variation was not reliably associated with geographical location on the rainfall gradient, suggesting that selection for local adaptation in response to water availability or other climate factors has been minimal. Nonetheless, species expressing phenotypic variation along environmental gradients may have greater capacity to respond to global change. The PhD has been submitted.</p>",1
1114,2014,"<p>The Lake Warden wetland system is one of the six Natural Diversity Recovery Catchments established to protect and/or recover biodiversity under threat from salinisation in the agricultural south-west. This wetland complex is also listed under the Ramsar Convention to protect wetlands of international importance. Waterbirds, including significant populations of resident and migratory shorebirds, are a key biological asset of this system and are the main drivers behind decisions to list the wetlands under the above mechanisms. Lake Warden once supported the largest populations of shorebirds within the system, but altered hydrology due to catchment clearing led to the virtual elimination of shorebird habitat. Engineering works have been installed to reduce inflows to Lake Warden and this has resulted in increased shorebird habitat, with positive signs of shorebird population recovery. However, the long-term management of this lake is dependent on a much more sophisticated understanding of its hydrogeochemistry and ecology. This has been demonstrated recently by the fact that salt loading over the last 20 years (unaccounted for in previous models) means that the lake may now be too salty (at the reduced depths) to maintain sufficient food resources for large shorebird populations. This project aims to produce hydrogeochemical and biological models for Lake Warden, linking hydrology, water chemistry (including salt and nutrient budgets) and elements of the biota (invertebrates and waterbirds). Such models will allow more refined management of the system and its catchment for recovery of its key biological assets.</p>
<p>Surface and groundwater monitoring is continuing. Waterbird monitoring is showing a clear relationship between abundance and salinity load. Aquatic invertebrate monitoring was largely ceased because population densities were too low and didn't justify the sampling effort. Water level modification/management at Lake Warden was very successful, resulting in lowered salinity concentrations and much higher waterbird abundance (mainly banded stilts) in 2013/14 than in the previous year when water levels were too low. In 2014/15 the aim will be to emulate the 2013/14 water depths and salinity to see if we get same high waterbird abundance. The next step in the project will be to undertake hydrological modelling to determine whether moving excess water (and therefore salt loads) onto Pink Lake is a viable solution to reducing salinity in Lake Warden.</p>",1

1118,2014,"<p>While much is known of the impact of trypanosomes on human and livestock health, trypanosomes in wildlife, although ubiquitous, have largely been considered to be non-pathogenic. This project aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and potential pathogenicity of trypanosomes naturally infecting Western Australian marsupials with particular emphasis on those parasites associated with the endangered woylie (<em>Bettongia penicillata</em>). 554 blood samples and 250 tissue samples collected from 50 carcasses of sick-euthanised and road-killed animals, belonging to 10 species of marsupials, were screened for the presence of trypanosomes using a PCR of the 18S rDNA gene. PCR results revealed a rate of infection of 67% in blood and 60% in tissues. Inferred phylogenetic trees using 18S rDNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) sequences showed the presence of three different species of <em>Trypanosoma</em>: <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em>, <em>Trypanosoma vegrandis</em>, and <em>Trypanosoma</em> sp. H25. <em>Trypanosoma</em> infections were compared in a declining and in a stable population of the woylie. High rates of infection with <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em> (96%) were found in the declining population, whereas in the stable population, <em>Trypanosoma vegrandis</em> was predominant (89%). Mixed infections were common in woylies from the declining but not from the stable population. Histopathological findings associated with either mixed or single infections involving <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em> showed pathological changes similar to those seen in <em>Didelphis marsupialis</em> infected with the pathogenic <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> in South America: myocarditis and tongue degeneration. <em>T. copemani</em> was successfully grown in culture and for the first time it was demonstrated that this species has the capacity to not only colonise different tissues in the host but also to invade cells in vitro. This study also showed that commercial drugs and new compounds developed against the pathogenic <em>T. cruzi</em> are active in vitro against <em>T. copemani</em>. These results provide evidence for the potential role of trypanosomes in the decline of the woylie and contribute valuable information towards directing management decisions for endangered species where these parasites are known to be present at high prevalence levels.</p>

1121,2014,"<p>Morphological and phylogenetic characterisation of trypanosomes isolated from both the Gilbert's potoroo (<em>Potorous gilbertii</em>) and quokka (<em>Setonix brachyurus</em>) from Two Peoples Bay, Albany, and Bald Island, has been completed. Characterisation has identified a novel species of trypanosome <em>T. copemani</em> affecting Western Australian native marsupials. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that <em>T. copemani</em> is closely related to the South American trypanosome <em>T. cruzi,</em> the etiological agent of Chagas disease known to be infective to both a wide variety of animal species and humans. The tick species <em>Ixodes australiensis</em> has recently been identified as the vector of <em>T. copemani</em>. Motile trypanosomes were found in sections of tick midguts and haemolymph, 49 and 117 days after tick collection, with sequencing showing 100% homology to <em>T. copemani</em> (genotype A). Detection of trypanosomes within tick faeces suggests that the transmission of <em>T.copemani</em> from vector to host is via the faecal-oral route. The survey to establish the prevalence of blood parasites (trypanosomes and Theileria) and gastrointestinal parasites (Eimeria, Giardia and Cryptosporidium) isolated from quokkas from three geographical locations (Two Peoples Bay, Bald Island and Rottnest Island) is still in progress. To date no trypanosomes have been detected in quokkas captured from Rottnest Island. These results show that a naive population of quokkas does exist and given the potential pathogenicity of trypanosomes when encountering a new host species, wildlife management is therefore crucial, particularly when dealing with species of conservation importance.</p>",1
1122,2014,"<p>This project comprised taxonomic and biogeographical studies on Australian members of the brown algal genus <em>Sargassum</em> and its close relatives, employing morphological and molecular techniques to investigate generic, subgeneric and species level boundaries, assisted by analyses of sequences from the nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes; ITS-2, cox3 and rbcL-S. The resulting phylogeny indicated the genus <em>Sargassum</em> as presently constituted to be polyphyletic, with closely related genera nested within. Combined with morphological observations, these results instigated several taxonomic transfers proposed at the species, subgeneric and generic level.</p>
<p>Initial components of this project investigated the two lesser-known <em>Sargassum</em> subgenera; <em>Phyllotricha</em> and <em>Arthrophycus</em> (Dixon <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2014), concluding that <em>Sargassum</em> was polyphyletic if subgenus <em>Phyllotricha</em> was included. To remedy this, the subgenus was restored to genus level as <em>Phyllotricha</em> Areschoug and several <em>Sargassum</em> species were transferred to it. The genetic variation within species of the former <em>S.</em> subgenus <em>Phyllotricha</em> was sufficient to recognize species-level variation and, for the most part, concurred with the current morphology-based taxonomy; thus most existing species were retained (albeit transferred to another genus), and just one reduced to synonymy.</p>
<p>The investigation into <em>Sargassum</em> subgenera <em>Arthrophycus</em> and <em>Bactrophycus</em> found the two taxa were not genetically or morphologically distinct, and their past and contemporary recognition was essentially based solely on their geographical distribution. Molecular analyses demonstrated that species of <em>S.</em> subgenus <em>Arthrophycus</em> were genetically nested within <em>S.</em> subgenus <em>Bactrophycus</em> section <em>Halochloa</em>, and this study proposed to transfer them accordingly, subsuming the name <em>Arthrophycus</em>. This newly circumscribed <em>S.</em> subgenus <em>Bactrophycus</em> has an antitropical and disjunct distribution, being present in the temperate to subtropical northwestern Pacific Ocean and the temperate to subtropical southern Indo-Pacific, but not at all in tropical equatorial waters.</p>
<p>The third aspect of this project focused on the north-western Australian Fucales and was based on extensive new collections made throughout tropical Western Australia. The order Fucales in this region is composed of five genera: <em>Hormophysa</em>, <em>Sargassopsis</em>, <em>Sargassum</em>, <em>Sirophysalis</em> and <em>Turbinaria</em>. Of these, <em>Sargassum</em> comprised 10 of the 16 species, and all but one of these was in subgenus <em>Sargassum</em>. A number of species new to the area were added as range extensions, including <em>Sargassum marginatum</em> (known previously from India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia), <em>Sargassum paradoxum</em> (known previously from temperate Australia), <em>Sargassum aquifolium</em> (common and including several previously recognised species as synonyms), and the new species <em>Sargassum rasta</em> (Dixon &amp; Huisman, in press).</p>",1
1275,2014,"<p>The aim of this project is to review the causes of deaths and histopathology in the woylies presented to Murdoch University in the last 10 years; with special attention dedicated to detecting the presence of Trypanosomes, their related histopathology and their significance. So far, two Woylies out of the (approximately) 50 have been identified to have organisms (morphologically similar to Trypanosomes) in association with muscle lesions in the oesophagus and heart. These muscle lesions may have potentially resulted in decreased food intake and abnormal function of the heart respectively; with possible contribution to the death of the individual. This project will also attempt to identify the Trypanosomes and demonstrate spatial association between <em>Trypanosoma</em> DNA and muscle (or other) lesions via the use of in-situ hybridization. In light of the recently published study by Botero et al.

1277,2014,"<p>Infectious disease has been suggested as a factor contributing to the recent 90% decline of the woylie, now critically endangered. The effects of infectious disease on woylies may be exacerbated by as yet unknown factors such as stress. This project aims to investigate how stress affects immune function and patterns of infection in the context of endangered species conservation. The hypothesis is: if stress affects immune function and patterns of infection in woylies, we expect changes in immunological variables and patterns of parasite infection with varying exposure to conservation relevant stressors. Endangered species face numerous threats that can constitute stressors that challenge an animals' physiological balance. Stressors to be investigated in this study include predators, resource availability, social interactions, population density and translocation.</p>
<p>Extensive field and laboratory work will be performed to investigate links between stress and disease expression in woylies in the context of their decline. Study populations include captive and free-ranging woylies at Native Animal Rescue, Karakamia Sanctuary, Whiteman Park and the Upper Warren region. Diagnostic and laboratory methods will be applied to conduct parallel evaluation of stress hormones, immune function and parasites in woylies. Data will be used to develop models to improve our understanding of how stress affects the health of endangered wildlife and potential ramifications for species conservation and management.</p>
<p>In the project's first year, intensive sample collection and preliminary analyses has been undertaken and the first paper accepted for publication. Fieldwork, sample collection, laboratory analyses and dissemination of information will continue with support from the Australian Academy of Science Margaret Middleton Fund, Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife and Holsworth Research Endowment.</p>",1
1287,2014,"<p>Research investigating the interactions between feral cats and dingoes at Lorna Glen began in the winter field season of 2013. During this time we initiated a pilot camera trap study to trial different camera trap techniques and investigate changes in predator activity following annual Eradicat baiting. Eighty cameras were placed either alongside roads or 100m off roads and were either left unbaited or else baited using an audio call lure. The study showed that the best method for detecting both feral cats and dingoes was to deploy either baited or unbaited cameras along roadsides. Cameras alongside roads that were baited showed a slightly higher detection rate although this difference was not significant while cameras off road showed virtually no detections whether baited or unbaited.</p>
<p>Using the on-road camera data from this study we also examined activity levels of feral cats and dingoes before, during, and after Eradicat baiting. The results of this study showed that activity of both predators (measured by the number of photo captures per trap night) decreased immediately following the baiting. However, by 30 days post-baiting, dingo activity had decreased to about 23% of pre-bait levels whereas cat activity increased to near pre-bait levels. By 60 days, dingo activity rebounded to about 53% and cat activity fell to 45% of pre-bait levels. This suggests that high levels of dingo activity may have some role in supressing cat activity.</p>
<p>The current phase of research for the project seeks to investigate fine-scale habitat use and diets of these two species to better understand their extent of spatial and dietary overlap. At present, we have deployed 136 camera traps across three major habitat types. This study will run for 21 days prior to the annual Eradicat baiting and again for 21 days starting two weeks after the baiting. An occupancy modelling approach will be used to analyse this data and will help us understand habitat use of dingoes and feral cats and how this habitat use is impacted by baiting.</p>
<p>To complement the current camera trap study, we have also fitted 16 dingoes and 21 feral cats with high precision GPS collars. These collars take a location fix every two or four hours and will give us detailed information on the movements of these predators through space and time and also help us understand how the baiting impacts their movement ecology. Finally, by analysing scat contents of these species we can get a good understanding of both their level of dietary competition and the impacts that these predators have on their prey species. To date, we have over 100 scats collected of each species and collections will continue until the end of 2014.</p>",1
1491,2015,"<p>The south-west of WA has experienced substantial climate change in the last several decades, particularly a significant reduction in winter rainfall since the 1970s. Modelling suggests that Banksia species, like many other WA plants, are susceptible to adverse impacts from climate change, including local extinctions at climate-stressed ends of the range resulting in range contractions and/or shifts. This study seeks to determine whether observable range-contraction has occurred since the 1970s in a range of common Banksia species, using data from the citizen science Banksia Atlas project and a contemporary citizen science project using volunteers to revisit targeted Banksia Atlas sites. It also seeks to measure stress-related parameters in Banksia leaves, to assess the likely causes of any observed range contractions</p>",2
2083,2018,"<p>Understanding abundance of species on reef systems and the factors that influence them is important for marine park management. This project used baited remotely operated underwater video to investigate factors that influence the distribution of grey reef sharks (<em>Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos</em>)&nbsp;and white tip reef sharks (<em>Triaenodon obesus</em>)&nbsp;at Ningaloo Marine Park. Both species were more abundant as the distance from boat ramps increased. In addition, white tip reef sharks were strongly influenced by the underlying structural complexity of the reef and were more abundant at places where the structural complexity of the reef was highly variable. These results indicate that proximity to boat ramps has a negative influence on shark abundance at Ningaloo, although the strength of this relationship varies among species, and for white tip sharks habitat is a better predictor of abundance. The thesis has been submitted and a manuscript is being prepared for publication.</p>",7
1922,2017,"<p>Effective wildlife management requires an understanding of how animals cope physiologically with stress. When stressors are encountered, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is activated releasing glucocorticoids, which can alter immune function and infectious disease dynamics. This project investigated the relationship between stress, immune function and parasite infection dynamics in woylies.</p>
<p>Woylies were trapped from wild populations, reserves and captivity with faecal and blood samples collected from over 300 individuals. Parallel parasitological and non-invasive endocrine analyses were performed to quantify endoparasites and faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM), end-products of HPA axis activation. An assay developed for human infants to assess innate immunity was also adapted for use in woylies. The novel results suggest that stress physiology and <em>Trypanosoma </em>infection status influence innate immunity. Collecting longitudinal field data, proximate factors that influenced woylie stress physiology, including season, sex, parasite status and body condition were identified. Woylies&rsquo; response to translocation and a major bushfire that unexpectedly occurred at a field site was also examined. After translocation, FCM was significantly higher than before or at the time of translocation. However, the variation was noted in both translocated and resident woylies and FCM was not related to short-term changes in parasite infection dynamics. FCM was not significantly higher immediately after the fire, nor were there corresponding changes in parasite load or body condition compared to the months preceding the fire. It is suggested that woylies can maintain homeostasis at least in the period immediately after a fire provided they are managed appropriately. The project provides new knowledge on woylie stress physiology and highlights the value of innovative tools to advance woylie conservation as they continue to face stressors in the future.</p>

2766,2020,"<p>The behaviour of pollinators has consequences for the plants they pollinate. Highly mobile nectar-feeding birds often display behaviour that results in more pollen carryover than insect pollinators, which is predicted to result in frequent outcrossing and high paternal diversity for bird-pollinated plants.

<p>Outcrossing rates were high but significantly less than one,&nbsp;and correlated paternity was surprisingly high. Bird visits to flowers were infrequent, most of which were by the western spinebill.

1441,2015,"<p>The ecology and genetic structure in the Australian water rat is being investigated to provide information to support management. In total 94 samples were obtained from across PNG, Northern Territory, eastern Australia, the Kimberley, Shark Bay, south-west Western Australia and Barrow Island. This set broadly represented almost all of the species' distribution. Analysis of nuclear DNA using microsatellite markers has been completed and draft chapter is currently in review. Markers revealed significant regional genetic structure across species range, with particularly high levels of differentiation recorded in south-west Western Australia, Barrow Island and Tasmania compared to remainder of regions. This genetic divergence appears to matches phenotypes (defined by pelt colouration) observed in Barrow island and south-west Western Australian populations.</p>
<p>Where sample sizes were sufficient for within-region analysis, substantial genetic structure was found within south-west Western Australia and the lower Murray River / Adelaide region in South Australia. Significant structure was found within south-west Western Australia at fine spatial scales (&lt;30km), broadly correlated with hydrological catchments, and tributaries and dominant vegetation, with relationships to habitat connectivity. Results from Barrow Island indicate a highly inbred, insular population in low abundance.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for management and conservation of the species, particularly in Western Australia. The new information will contribute to resolve the species' taxonomic status - review of the taxonomic and conservation status particularly of south-west Western Australia and Barrow Island populations is required. The level of differentiation among populations needs to be taken into account in any translocation program.</p>

<p>Woylie populations (both wild and captive) are relatively small and isolated, making them potentially more susceptible to impacts of perturbations and pathogens. Indeed, infectious pathogens may have played a role the recent woylie decline. Thus, this project focuses on understanding woylie response to perturbations (specifically fire and reserve expansion) as reflected by changes in movement patterns, social structure, and health. GPS collars were used to monitor woylies in a predator-proof reserve, Whiteman Park, while concurrently collecting data on body condition and screening for a variety of parasites. Evaluation of changes in movement patterns and conspecific interactions (home range area/overlap, nest-sharing, contact) relative to these perturbations was made through a combination of more traditional statistics and social network analysis. Assessing longitudinal trends in parasitism with respect to demographic factors and perturbations, enabled identification of potential risk factors for parasitism and how they might be impacted by perturbations.&nbsp;Fieldwork and laboratory work have been completed, and analysis and writing is underway.&nbsp;</p>

1703,2016,"<p>The aims of this project were to 1) test the suitability of spotlighting and distance sampling for providing population estimates and trends of western ringtail and brushtail possums; 2) assess the significance of vegetation structure in the detection of possums, and 3) provide a population estimate for possums in the Kingston forest block and Perup Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Results from the project indicate that spotlighting from a vehicle was more efficient than on foot. Density estimates of brushtail possums from spotlighting was lower than those derived from trapping. Results also indicated that vegetation density was significantly greater before compared with after a mild prescribed burn but did not seem to affect possum detection rates.&nbsp;Despite low spotlight detection rates limiting the ability for robust population estimates of possums in the jarrah forest, this remains a better method than trapping for western ringtail possums and a satisfactory complement to trapping for brushtail possums.

1496,2015,"<p>Monitoring methods&nbsp;for one asset often collect information relevant to other natural assets. Use of a single method to monitor the condition of multiple assets can reduce operational costs of a monitoring program, although it is important that the method does not compromise manager&rsquo;s ability to detect signals of change in biological indicators. This study investigated comparability of benthic community data recorded by downwards facing cameras, commonly used in benthic monitoring programs, and a forward facing stereo-DOV (F-DOV) typically used in fish surveys. Analyses indicated a degree of similarity in the benthic taxa detected by the two digital imagery methods; however the forward facing stereo F-DOV video systems demonstrated an enhanced ability to describe erect benthic components of the reef, and limited ability to detect benthos with low morphological profiles in comparison to downwards facing cameras. Using comparative models, data recorded by one method can be adjusted and corrected to make it comparable with the data collected by the alternative method. Thus, Stereo-DOV surveys for fish can be considered a suitable method for the simultaneous assessment of fish and important benthic habitat. In conjunction with imagery collected using downwards facing cameras Stereo-DOV imagery may also provide a more extensive and cost effective description of the benthic marine environment through space and time.</p>

1468,2015,"<p>Vertebrate fauna translocations, particularly to mainland sites, have a low rate of success (&lt;30%). One potentially contributing factor that has been poorly studied is the impact of parasite loads and pathogenic disease in founder individuals during the stressful establishment period. Each individual carries many species of ectoparasite, enteric parasites and haemoparasites, which may impact directly or indirectly on the host or other species in the environment of the establishing population. For example, blood parasites in the <em>Trypanosoma</em> group have been closely associated with the decline of the woylie, <em>Bettongia penicillata</em>. This work aims to assess the survivorship impacts of disease and parasite load within the establishing population of golden bandicoots (<em>Isoodon auratus</em>) and boodies (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) during the first 18 months of translocation.</p>
<p>We experimentally manipulated the population by regularly dosing half the animals with a broad spectrum antiparasitic treatment in order to disrupt the life cycles of a variety of ecto, enteric and haemoparasites. During this intensive monitoring, other demographic and life history data were collected, as well as biological samples such as blood, DNA and faecal samples. Progress to date includes longitudinal trapping and data collection following the release of 160 golden bandicoots from Barrow Island and 170 boodies from Dryandra and Barrow Island. Approximately 800 blood samples were analysed for species-specific detection of <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em> and <em>T. vegrandis</em>. Ectoparasites were identified to species level to determine whether there has been a change in species diversity in the new environment, and to determine the effectiveness of the antiparasitic treatment. Presence of these trypanosomes and ectoparasites were added to models of survivorship to determine if there was a relationship, as well as to follow the pattern of infection across the population. Skeletal and mass measurements, body condition and fecundity of golden bandicoots released at Lorna Glen and Hermite Island were compared to long-term monitoring data from the source population. Upon establishment at both new sites, translocated males increased in condition (i.e. body mass but not skeletal size) and females showed an increased reproductive output. Bandicoots born at translocation sites were significantly larger and heavier (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.0001 respectively) than the founders from the island population within 18 months of establishment. This change in skeletal size, mass and fecundity took place in a single generation at both mainland and island translocation sites, suggesting that the response is not one of evolution by natural selection. This study demonstrated that the small size of golden bandicoots on Barrow Island is not a genotypic response to selective pressures, but rather a phenotypic response to conditions on the island. When translocated to vacant ecological niches, they have the capacity to produce offspring with increased body mass, size and reproductive output. We suggest that ecological processes relating to resource limitation drive 'island dwarfism' in <em>I. auratus</em>.</p>

1495,2015,"<p>The aim of this thesis was to explore and validate management options for increasing genetic diversity in translocated populations. Specifically, the effectiveness of founder selection and population supplementation was assessed, using the critically endangered woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) as a model species. The woylie has a complex conservation history, and is currently undergoing an unexplained decline. The establishment of insurance populations is an important conservation strategy for this species and presents a valuable opportunity for testing and measuring translocation strategies.</p>
<p>Using genetic data, this study determined that the genetic diversity of a founding population could be more efficiently captured using a spatially-designed sampling regime. Tested against conventional grid and transect trapping methods, the species-specific model returned animals that were less related, and therefore more genetically appropriate, for establishing a translocated population.<br />Population models were developed to forecast the genetic diversity of two translocated woylie populations, before and after population supplementation. Genetic data was then used to assess the efficacy of the modelling projections and determine whether or not supplementation was effective at maintaining genetic diversity over time. The population models were shown to over-estimate diversity in both instances, with only a modest increase in one population, and a decrease in the other. These results indicate that the animals used in supplementation were reproductively ineffective, or simply did not survive long enough to contribute genetically to the population</p>
<p>The results of this study have real implications for the ongoing management of real woylie populations, and highlight the value of genetic monitoring in translocations. Additionally, this work makes a valuable contribution to the burgeoning science of reintroduction biology, by providing much needed empirical evidence into the effectiveness of two genetic management strategies.</p>",2

1464,2015,"<p>This project aimed to determine if there is regional variation in the understorey of <em>Eucalyptus salmonophloia</em> woodlands across the Great Western Woodlands (GWW) and, if so, what environmental factors were influencing it. The project then integrated relevant existing survey data from across the Wheatbelt to assess the variation across the two bioregions in which salmon gum woodlands occur, Avon-Wheatbelt and Coolgardie. This project fills large gaps in the floristic surveys of the GWW, which have previously focused on the banded ironstone and greenstone ranges. One hundred sites were sampled in spring 2011 and 2012, in old growth woodlands or woodlands where the timber cutting and/or grazing history could be estimated. Data was collected on species composition, cover and height, tree dimensions, site-based variables, and soil physical and chemical characteristics. Detailed classification and ordination of the data revealed two main communities; one with an understorey of mainly chenopod species on soils higher in clay found in the drier north and east of the GWW, and the other with non-chenopod species (e.g. <em>Eremophila</em> spp., <em>Acacia</em> spp., <em>Scaevola spinescens</em> and <em>Alyxia buxifolia</em>) found on sandier soils in the wetter south and west. Precipitation, monthly precipitation variability and temperature, and to a lesser extent soil phosphorous, pH, silt content, and cover of organic crust influenced the patterns in floristic composition and differentiated between the two main communities. When data from the Wheatbelt was incorporated the two GWW communities remained prominent and were joined by two Wheatbelt communities and one community (with <em>Melaleuca pauperiflora</em>) that traversed the two regions. Across this larger area the influence of the annual precipitation gradient and ratio of summer to winter rainfall (less in the east) was strong. Generally regional factors (such as climate) were more influential on the floristic patterns that local (such as soil) factors. This project has contributed to knowledge about these woodlands relevant to their conservation status, delineation of subregional boundaries and land management activities. The salmon gum - chenopod shrublands burn less frequently as they are less flammable and have a more sparse cover that the salmon gum - eremophila woodlands which are experiencing fire more frequently and consequently being reduced in extent. Vouchers for all species collected will be lodged in the Perth Herbarium and the field data will be lodged with TERN-&AElig;KOS.</p>",2
1461,2015,"<p>The aim of this study is to increase understanding of the role of the protozoan parasite&nbsp;<em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>&nbsp;in wild woylie populations, particularly with regard to the recent population declines.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em> can infect virtually any warm-blooded vertebrate, and has a worldwide distribution. In asymptomatic laboratory and wild rodents,&nbsp;<em>T. gondii&nbsp;</em>is reported to cause changes in behaviour that may make infected hosts more susceptible to predation. If&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em>&nbsp;alters the behaviour of woylies, this could predispose infected individuals to predation and increase mortality rates, thus contributing towards the decline of woylie populations. Serum samples collected by Department of Parks and Wildlife staff between 2008-2010 have been analysed to determine&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em>&nbsp;infection status based on presence or absence of antibodies. Testing of these samples revealed a very low sero-prevalence (~5%) of&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em>&nbsp;antibodies in woylies, which is in agreement with work by previous students. Due to this low sero-prevalence, it has been difficult to investigate whether&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em>&nbsp;affects woylie behaviour. This outcome will be ongoing and is likely to be descriptive rather than statistical. Testing of longitudinal serum samples in the current project has revealed that sero-diagnosis is complicated, and false negatives may be common. This has important implications for wildlife disease monitoring that relies on serology. In conjunction with the woylie project, we have also investigated mouse behaviour in response to experimental&nbsp;<em>T. gondii&nbsp;</em>infection; particularly behaviours related to activity level, anxiety behaviour and cat urine avoidance behaviour. In contrast to many other studies, we found limited evidence for&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em>-induced behavioural changes in mice. Three posters and one oral presentation have been presented on this work at conferences. Two scientific journal articles concerning the effect of&nbsp;<em>T. gondii</em>&nbsp;on rodent host behaviour have been published so far.</p>",2

1444,2015,"<p>Characterisation of Australian native trypanosomes has detected a high prevalence of <em>T. copemani</em> affecting quokka populations at both Two Peoples Bay (91.4%-32/35) and Bald Island (85.3% 29/34) and now for the first time recent research as part of this PhD has identified <em>T. copemani</em> in two quokka isolates from Rottnest Island. Given that the main cause of animal trypanosomiasis is haemolytic anaemia, the detection of trypanosomes on Rottnest may account for the unknown cause of seasonal anaemia and low red blood cell counts previously reported in quokkas from the Island. Further clinical investigations are needed to determine the clinical impact of <em>T. copemani</em> on quokka populations but preliminary findings show erythrocyte abnormalities associated with haemolytic anaemias, in trypanosome infected quokkas. In addition to <em>T.</em> <em>copemani</em>, a novel <em>Trypanosoma</em> sp. genetically similar to a kangaroo isolate H25, previously reported to be closely related to <em>T.</em> <em>cruzi,</em> was identified in one quokka, while another quokka isolate had mixed infections of both <em>T. copemani</em> and <em>T. vegrandis</em> and is the first report of <em>T. vegrandis</em> in quokkas. In depth morphological analysis using light microscopy, immunofluorescence, scanning electron microscopy and fluorescent <em>in situ</em> hybridisation has identified, a promastigote, amastigote and sphaeromastigote stages <em>in vivo</em>, as well as novel trypanosome life&ndash;cycle stages, representing an oval stage, an extremely thin stage and an adherent stage. Interesting the adherent stage represented by a small rounded independently rapid moving form or a form found on the surface of erythrocytes may have the potential to cause erythrocyte destruction, consequently leading to both erythrophagocytosis and haemolytic anaemia, a common feature of trypanosomiasis, with the exact cause unknown. This study shows that trypomastigotes are not the only trypanosome life-cycle stage present within the blood stream of Australian marsupials. The absent of the true blood stream trypomastigotes stage and low parasitemia may account for the previous lack of detection of trypanosomes on Rottnest Island, given that only sphaeromastigote and amastigote stage were observed. The importance of understanding all the life-cycle stages of Australian trypanosomes is important when considering clinical diagnosis, false negatives in epidemiological studies and preventing disease outbreaks.</p>

1467,2015,"<p>This project investigates genetic factors that will contribute to improved fauna translocation success.</p>
<p>Investigation of the fine-scale genetic structure of a mainland dibbler (<em>Parantechinus apicalis</em>) population in and around Fitzgerald River National Park (FRNP) using spatial autocorrelation suggests a significant relationship between genetic and geographic distances between trapping locations. Dibblers located at least 20km away were less likely to be related than dibblers found within 20km.</p>
<p>Genetic and demographic data are being assessed in dibblers from the translocated Escape population, Boullanger population and Whitlock population. Genetic data has been collected, and demographic data of the Boullanger and Whitlock populations are being gathered from the past records.</p>
<p>The animals for the dibbler translocation to Escape Island were sourced from populations on Boullanger and Whitlock islands that are genetically distinct and have slightly different body sizes. Genetic analysis show evidence of genetic mixing which started from the captive bred colony and continued in the Escape population. However, the mixing seemed to bias toward the Boullanger ancestor, and appears to be size related. Females were observed to preferred heavier males. A low effective population size of approximately eight dibblers was estimated from the genotypic data. Morphological comparisons between different offspring groups, after taking gender differences into account, showed no significant differences except for the head length. However, the sample size was small. Population viability analysis suggested the Escape population will persist for another 70 years. A supplementation as low as seven pairs of dibblers every 10 years can prolong population's persistence.</p>
<p>Investigation of a burrowing bettong translocation to where animals were derived from two genetically and morphologically distinct source populations, Barrow Island and Dorre Island, showed evidence of genetic mixing. The new population had higher genetic diversity in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA than its parental populations. However, the results suggested a genetic bias toward larger Dryandra bettongs. Based on mtDNA, 70% of interbred offspring were born from Dryandra mothers and Barrow Island fathers. This suggested that the uneven founder proportion from each source population may influence the genetic bias. Offspring morphology showed a positive relationship between the offspring body size and the parental genetic percentage, where the interbred offspring were larger than expected.</p>

1917,2017,"<p>Seaweed-dominated habitats occur in tropical reef systems, where they play vital roles in supporting key species and processes. Habitat quality in seaweed patches, measured as canopy height, holdfast density or percentage cover, varies seasonally and can be a major driver of the presence and abundance of key functional and taxonomic fish groups. However, the relative influence of other seascape variables, such as patch shape, size and proximity, remains poorly understood. This project will study seaweed habitats at Ningaloo Marine Park, building on research in the region that has highlighted the importance of seaweed micro-habitat and intra-patch structure by including patch and inter-patch measures. The study will focus on fishes of the family Labridae (wrasses and parrotfishes), which are a diverse group of conspicuous reef fishes that span a wide range of trophic groups, body sizes, social structures, movement patterns and diel ranges. Specifically the project will:&nbsp; (1) establish how within and between patch habitat structure influences reef fish diversity within the Ningaloo lagoon; (2) explore how patch habitat configuration influences fish predator-prey dynamics; and (3) quantify how seaweed-associated fish assemblages respond to acute and unseasonal disturbances in patch-habitat condition.</p>

1449,2015,"<p>This project focused on investigating the correlation of the trypanosomes found in the blood of woylies and the overall population decline of the host. Trypanosomes in the blood of the woylie can be grouped into three morphologically distinct trypomastigote forms, encompassing two different species; two phenotypes of <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em> and one form of the smaller, <em>Trypanosoma vegrandis</em> sp. <em>nov</em>. The prevalence of parasitic infections varied among the study sites, with contrasting trypanosome prevalence observed from the two declining indigenous populations within the Upper Warren region in south-west Western Australia. Parasitaemia associated with trypanosome infection in the peripheral blood of the woylie exhibited a temporal decline as the infection progressed, being indicative of the infection transitioning between the acute and chronic phase. <em>Trypanosoma copemani</em> also exhibits a predilection for certain tissues of the host, where they can display <em>Trypanosoma</em> cruzi-like pathology at the time of autopsy. It appears that the chronic intracellular association of trypanosomes with the internal organs of the woylie may be potentially pathogenic and adversely affect the fitness and coordination of the woylie, making them more susceptible to predation, and contributing to the overall decline. Three scientific papers have been published, and one is in preparation.</p>

1473,2015,"<p>Species with restricted distributions, known as short-range endemics (SREs) are more susceptible to extinction than those that occupy a wide range and variety of habitats. The Yilgarn Banded Iron Formations (BIF; 500km north-east of Perth) are biodiversity hotspots that harbour many SREs. This project will examine the genetic diversity and structure present in three, co-occurring Yilgarn SREs in order to determine their evolutionary history and to identify regions of high genetic diversity and therefore conservation significance.</p>
<p>Genetic data, using selected chloroplast DNA markers, indicated low genetic diversity and some genetic structuring in both plant species. Nuclear data in <em>B. arborea</em> is also indicating low levels of genetic variation and structure. Results for the millipede <em>A. bamfordi</em> using selected mitochondrial DNA markers indicated genetic structuring across BIF ranges, with a pattern indicative of an historical vicariance event leading to isolation of BIF populations during the mid-Pleistocene around one million years before present. Both mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers show higher genetic diversity in the large, more topographically complex BIFs and this has significant conservation implications for the future management of the species.

2765,2020,"<p>Plant communities have been the primary focus of ecological restoration initiatives. However, the integration of the soil microbiome is an increasing focus of restoration practice. The interdependent nature of the above- and below-ground biological environments has led to assumptions that reciprocal shifts in community compositions will occur in response to disturbance and restoration. Here, a 30-year restoration chronosequence of vegetation development was compared with that of the below-ground assemblages of bacteria and fungi, identified using eDNA methods.</p>
<p>Similarities between restoration trajectories of fungal and vegetation assemblages were found, though both remained distinct from reference Jarrah forest compositions. In contrast, soil bacterial assemblages in restored Jarrah forest re-assembled rapidly, with substrate depth being a greater driver of composition than vegetation.

1470,2015,"<p>Weather is a primary driver of bushfire behaviour. Much of the science linking interactions between fire weather and fire behaviour was established in the 1960s and 1970s, but new advances in understanding and computer modelling capability provide the scope to better understand the interactions of weather and fire behaviour. Coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to capture feedback loops between the fire and the atmosphere, enabling better understanding of how a fire may modify the environment in which it is burning. This is of particular importance during large-scale, high-intensity bushfires. This project aims to explore the capabilities and applications of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by examining case studies of actual bushfires, and by running idealised simulations where the sensitivity response to different input variables can be tested. Case studies include forest and shrubland fires in southern Australia. A detailed technical report examining significant aspects of the behaviour of the Kangaroo Island bushfires of December 2007 has been published. A case study of unexpectedly severe fire behaviour during a prescribed burn in October 2010 at Layman block east of Margaret River was published in the <em>Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal</em>.</p>
<p>The WRF model has been used to investigate the effect of coupling between the fire and the atmosphere. This has been done by simulating the growth of well-documented fires with and without the coupling function in the WRF model being enabled. Clear differences in fire behaviour have been observed between these contrasting model runs, and differences are consistent with known fire behaviour phenomena. A paper describing simulations of the 2007 D'Estrees fire was published in the <em>Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology. </em>A manuscript describing simulations of the Layman prescribed burn and has been accepted by the <em>Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal</em>, and a further manuscript is in review.

1970,2017,"<p>This study focused on a declining population of south-western Brush-tailed Possums (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula hypoleucus</em>) to assess genetic variability and inform future management strategies. Between 2007 &ndash; 2009 a total of ninety-five individuals of&nbsp;<em>T. v. hypoleucus</em>&nbsp;were translocated from four extant populations within Western Australia to the Matuwa Kurrara Kurrara Indigenous Protected Area in central Western Australia. The latest monitoring survey at Matuwa in 2015 indicated the minimum number of animals known to be alive as 25, though capture-recapture analysis estimated that the total population size may be up to 50 animals. The reasons for this decline are unknown. Mortality of reintroduced radio-collared individuals was largely undetermined but there were no records of individuals being predated by cats. However, during trap monitoring of reintroduced possums, many individuals were considered to be under-weight suggesting the possibility of resource limitation in the period soon after translocation. In addition, this current small population may now be vulnerable to effects of reduced genetic variation and inbreeding.</p>
<p>This study investigated whether a lack of genetic diversity or presence of inbreeding could be contributing factors in the decline of the translocated population at Matuwa. Genetic diversity and inbreeding in the Matuwa population was compared to the original source populations to detect whether there has been a loss of diversity or increase in inbreeding. A population viability model was constricted for&nbsp;<em>T. v. hypoleucus&nbsp;</em>at Matuwa to investigate factors important for the long-term persistence of the translocated population.</p>
<p>Tissue samples from 146 animals were analysed using 13 microsatellite loci. Inbreeding was lower and heterozygosity was higher in the translocated Matuwa population than two source populations studied, highlighting the benefits of promoting outbreeding through the use of multiple source populations in translocations. However, allelic richness at Matuwa is low suggesting the impact of population bottlenecks on genetic diversity, which was supported by significant tests for genetic bottlenecks. Despite the genetic health of the population being stronger than predicted, this population is still threatened due to environmental factors. Population viability analysis suggests it is facing further declines within the next 10-15 years without future management of the site. Several management strategies are suggested including population supplementation and provision of artificial nest boxes. A manuscript has been prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.</p>

<p>Overall, a total of 66 cats (30 male and 36 female) and 101 rats (47 males, 53 females and one not recorded) collected from Christmas Island have been necropsied and samples collected for further testing. A high prevalence of parasitic infection was found in these hosts with greater than 84% of both cats and rats found to be harbouring at least one parasite species and up to six (for cats) and seven (for rats) different parasite species (total infracommunity richness, ICR). Overall, 18 different helminth genera were represented, with a local richness of 10 species identified in cats (representing four Phyla; Nematoda, Cestoda, Trematoda, and Acanthocephala) and 12 species identified in rats (three Phyla; Nematoda, Cestoda, and Acanthocephala). The local richness and total infracommunity richness found in this study is higher than expected. This is due to the island syndrome which dictates that island communities should typically have a high prevalence but a low richness of parasite species due to the founder effect. However this study has found an unusually high local and infracommunity richness, the reasons of which are still to be elucidated.</p>
<p>This study detected no significant correlations with body condition and parasite community ecology in cats; however overall presence of parasites and total infracommunity richness is found to be significantly correlated with body condition in rats. Gender was also found to play a role in parasite community ecology with female cats being more likely to harbour a greater total and visceral infracommunity richness as well as intensity of the bile duct fluke, <em>Platynosomum concinnum</em>. In opposition to this male rats were more likely to have a high intensity of the tapeworm, <em>Taenia taeniaeformis</em>. In addition to a high number of parasites that have a potential conservation and zoonotic significance, this study also expands the geographic range of eight parasite species as well as the discovery of a potentially novel Spirurid species in rats. These results indicate that a suite of parasites were inadvertently introduced to Christmas Island along with the introduction of both cats and rats. A number of these parasites require suitable intermediate hosts to persist and given the paucity of mammalian species on Christmas Island, we need to consider the involvement of alternative host species in maintaining transmission cycles. Molecular screening of tissue samples for <em>Leptospira</em> spp. in both cats and rats is due to be performed shortly.

1472,2015,"<p>The aim of this study was to determine the trophic role of pomacentrid fishes as herbivores on temperate algal-dominated reefs, with a particular focus on the abundant species <em>Parma mccullochi</em>. The study was undertaken in Marmion Marine Park and determined the diet of this species, including ontogenetic changes, and the impact of grazing by pomacentrids on algal production and the composition of temperate reef algal communities.</p>
<p><em>Parma mccullochi</em> was found to be a strict herbivore, feeding almost entirely on foliose and filamentous red algae and the diets of juvenile and adult fish did not differ. Electivity indices indicated that <em>P. mccullochi</em> specifically selected these algaes. Macroalgae differed significantly inside and outside <em>P. mccullochi</em> territories and a caging experiment in territories indicated a moderate effect on the composition of recruiting algae.</p>

1446,2015,"<div align=""justify"">The kinetoplast is an organelle that is present in all trypanosomatids. It contains&nbsp;a giant network of thousands of catenated circular DNAs&nbsp;(kDNA) with unique structure and function. KDNA consist of a few dozen maxicircles that encode mitochondrial gene products, and several thousand minicircles that encode guide RNAs for the editing of mitochondrial RNA transcripts. Minicircles have been extensively used in the development of sensitive and specific diagnostic molecular tools due to their abundance and heterogeneity in size and sequence between species. They contain a 12-nucleotide-sequence named &ldquo;The Universal Minicircle Sequence&rdquo; (UMS) that is conserved within most trypanosomatids. The number of UMS elements and their location in each minicircle differ between species. Our results report novel insights into the kinetoplast structure and kDNA organisation of&nbsp;<em>Trypanosoma copemani</em>,&nbsp;a parasite associated with the drastic decline of the Australian marsupial&nbsp;<em>Bettongia penicillata</em>.

1908,2017,"<p>Structurally complex macrophyte patches within the Ningaloo lagoon act as nursery habitat for juvenile fish of ecological and fisheries importance. A strong association between juvenile fish and macrophyte habitat implies that fish feed on resources within these habitats, but there is little information on the diet of juvenile fish, especially in macroalgal habitats. This project will determine the importance of macroalgae and associated fauna to the diet of juvenile fishes at various macroalgal sites at Ningaloo Marine Park.</p>
<p>The results of the project show herbivorous rabbit and surgeon fish initially feed on filamentous algae but become increasingly reliant on macroalgae as they grow. Juvenile emperors feed on a range of invertebrates, including various types of worms, whilst goat fish fed mainly on crustaceans. Stable isotope analysis is required to determine if primary sources of energy in juvenile fish diets are from macroalgae and clarify the role of seaweeds in juvenile diets.

1428,2015,"<p>The <em>Tetratheca hirsuta</em> auth. complex is the last remaining unresolved complex in the endemic Australian genus <em>Tetratheca</em>. The complex comprises the highly variable <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, as well as two phrase-named, conservation priority taxa <em>T</em>. sp. Boonanarring and <em>T</em>. sp. Granite. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether <em>T</em>. sp. Boonanarring and <em>T</em>. sp. Granite warrant formalisation as taxa distinct from <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, and if so, at what rank. As part of the resolution of the species complex, the study also aimed to test Thompson's (1976) assertion that individuals with large leaves and straight white stem hairs are <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em> rather than the sister species of the complex, <em>T</em>.<em> hispidissima</em>. An integrative approach incorporating morphometric multivariate analysis, Elliptic Fourier Analysis of leaf shapes, and phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast (<em>ndhF-trnL</em>,<em> rpl16</em>,<em> trnS-trnG5'2S</em>) and the nuclear ribosomal DNA region ETS was used to resolve taxonomic boundaries within the <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em> species complex. Morphological data show strong morphological divergence between <em>T.</em> sp. Boonanarring, and <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, and suggested that the morphological concept of <em>T.</em> sp. Granite should be expanded to include some morphotypes of <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>. In addition, morphological analysis indicated that individuals with large leaves and straight white stem hairs are more similar to <em>T</em>.<em> hispidissima</em> than to <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>. Phylogenetic analysis of the ETS region showed congruence with morphology, indicating that these morphological groups are also genetically divergent. In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of chloroplast regions yielded low resolution, perhaps due to incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgression. These results suggest that the groups of <em>T</em>.<em> hirsuta</em>, <em>T</em>. sp. Boonanarring and an expanded concept of <em>T</em>. sp.

Impacts of cats on mammals can be minimised by burning under conditions that favour less intense, smaller and more patchy fires. Impacts on mammals can also be reduced by minimising cattle disturbance of ground layer vegetation. Threatened mammals, including the golden backed tree rat and the scaly tailed possum, use a diverse array of habitat attributes to meet their resource requirements (e.g. nesting hollows, fruiting trees), and may utilise both recently burnt and long unburnt vegetation.

Exposure to <em>T. gondii</em> is associated with decreased repeatability of 'activity in the elevated plus maze (EPM)' appears to be due to baseline dependent effects of <em>T. gondii </em>exposure on behaviour; individuals that started with low 'activity in the EPM' tended to increase their activity over time post-infection and <em>vice versa</em>.

An ecological assessment' that aims to assess the success of restoration in terms of ecological and genetic viability for plant species in the Fitzgerald River-Stirling Range region of Western Australia, where significant investment is being made in restoring connectivity at a landscape scale. The recognition of poorly defined success criteria and a lack of long term monitoring have highlighted the need for the development of post implementation empirical evaluations of the quality of restoration activities.&nbsp; This recognition has led to the hypothesis that the most ecologically and genetically viable restored populations will be those where reproductive outputs, plant pollinator interactions, levels of genetic diversity, mating systems and patterns of pollen dispersal most closely mimic those found in natural or undisturbed remnant vegetation. These populations are more likely to persist in the long term and contribute to effective ecosystem function through integration into the broader landscape.The aims of this project are to assess and compare insect flower visitors, seed weight, levels of genetic diversity and the mating system for restored and natural remnant populations of <em>Hakea laurina</em>.</p>
<p>Field work was undertaken at four sites (two revegetation and two natural remnants). Insect flower visitors observations and collections were undertaken, and seed collections were made to determine seed weight as a measure of reproductive fitness. Levels of genetic diversity and mating system for the populations were determined using 12 microsatellite markers<em>. </em>Results show that remnant populations have significantly greater insect abundance.

1920,2017,"<p>This project explored evidence for top-down suppression of an exotic mesopredator, the feral cat <em>Felis catus</em>, by a native apex predator, the dingo <em>Canis lupis dingo</em>&nbsp;in an arid rangeland environment in Western Australia (Matuwa).&nbsp; It examined the spatial dynamics of feral cat and dingo distributions and activities and the potential for competition between them for shared prey.&nbsp; By analysing both spatial and dietary dimensions of dingo and feral cat interactions the research allowed for a very detailed characterization of this intraguild relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was no strong evidence for dingo suppression of feral cats in this study system.&nbsp; Low dietary overlap between the two species suggests limited interspecific competition, which may also facilitate their observed spatial overlap.&nbsp; Feral cats may show a preference for grasslands but whether this is driven by avoidance of dingoes or by the occurrence of other resources such as prey warrants further investigation.&nbsp; This knowledge obtained in this project contributes to the conceptual development of top-down ecological theory and increases the understanding of how apex predators and smaller mesopredators relate to one another in their environment.</p>

The study will test the hypotheses that with increasing fire severity, overstorey trees will exhibit higher levels of seedling recruitment and lower levels of epicormic resprouting, and that high severity fire will result in a more homogenous understorey dominated by plant species that are ephemeral or have attributes that make them successful as disturbance opportunists. Nine study sites were established in March 2016 sampling unburnt forest and forest burnt at low and high severity, as determined by crown scorch and defoliation. At each site, all trees within a 30 m x 30 m quadrat were measured for stem diameter and crown condition, and understorey species composition determined in five 4m<sup>2</sup> quadrats.

1706,2016,"<p>The condition of fish and coral communities are often monitored using digital imagery, but the techniques used to collect data differ. &nbsp;Fish data are collected using a forward facing video, whist coral communities are monitored using cameras that face downward towards the substratum. This project collected forward and downward facing video and compared information from the two methods to assess compatibility of benthic/coral data collected using the two methods. Forward facing video detected more vertically erect coral and canopy forming algae but less turf algae and encrusting corals than the downward facing video. Moreover downward facing video identified more coral genera and fewer corals were unidentifiable, suggesting a higher level of taxonomic resolution is achievable when using downward facing video. There were however strong relationships between the percentages of common benthos recorded by the methods. Thus, stereo video surveys for fish may be considered a potential technique for the description of coral reef benthos but is not necessarily suitable for the monitoring of benthic community assemblages at high taxonomic levels.</p>

1735,2016,"<p>This project investigated genetic factors that could contribute to improved fauna translocation success.&nbsp;The study highlighted the importance of incorporating knowledge of fine-scale genetic structure when sampling wild individuals for captive breeding and translocation programs. Using examples of dibbler and boodie translocations, the outcomes of genetic mixing of founder stocks has added to rare empirical studies of marsupial translocations founded from multiple sources. Genetic mixing has been shown to benefit the newly established populations of dibblers and boodies. Increased levels of genetic diversity and reduced genetic relatedness among offspring were reported. However they also showed a significant reduction in the effective population size as a result of founder effects. This study has shown that population lineages within newly established populations are prone to changes from mortality and / or reproductive variance among founders and release strategies. Therefore, genetic monitoring is important, not only for assessing translocation success, but also for determining whether supplementation of managed populations is required.</p>

1741,2016,"<p>Overall, a total of 66 cats (30 male and 36 female) and 101 rats (47 males, 53 females and one not recorded) collected from Christmas Island have been necropsied and samples collected for further testing. A high prevalence of parasitic infection was found in these hosts with greater than 84% of both cats and rats found to be harbouring at least one parasite species and up to six (for cats) and seven (for rats) different parasite species (total infracommunity richness, ICR). Overall, 18 different helminth genera were represented, with a local richness of 10 species identified in cats (representing four Phyla; Nematoda, Cestoda, Trematoda, and Acanthocephala) and 12 species identified in rats (three Phyla; Nematoda, Cestoda, and Acanthocephala). The local richness and total infracommunity richness found in this study is higher than expected. This is due to the island syndrome which dictates that island communities should typically have a high prevalence but a low richness of parasite species due to the founder effect. However this study has found an unusually high local and infracommunity richness, the reasons of which are still to be elucidated.</p>
<p>This study detected no significant correlations with body condition and parasite community ecology in cats; however overall presence of parasites and total infracommunity richness is found to be significantly correlated with body condition in rats. Gender was also found to play a role in parasite community ecology with female cats being more likely to harbour a greater total and visceral infracommunity richness as well as intensity of the bile duct fluke, <em>Platynosomum concinnum</em>. In opposition to this male rats were more likely to have a high intensity of the tapeworm, <em>Taenia taeniaeformis</em>. In addition to a high number of parasites that have a potential conservation and zoonotic significance, this study also expands the geographic range of eight parasite species as well as the discovery of a potentially novel Spirurid species in rats.

Population models were developed to forecast the genetic diversity of two translocated woylie populations, before and after population supplementation. Genetic data was then used to assess the efficacy of the modelling projections and determine whether or not supplementation was effective at maintaining genetic diversity over time. The preliminary results obtained in this study indicate that the developed models had the tendency of overestimating the genetic diversity that could be achieved through a supplementation program. This may be possibly caused by animals used in supplementation being reproductively ineffective, or simply not surviving long enough to contribute genetically to the population. These results have implications for the ongoing management of woylie populations and highlight the important contribution that genetic monitoring can make to the science of reintroduction biology.</p>",5

This project is investigating dead and injured turtles stranded along the coast and using pathology to diagnose the causes of death. Blood samples are being obtained from healthy turtles to determine reference ranges for species where gaps exist. Parasite infections and fibropapilloma virus are being specifically investigated. Although focused on flatback turtles, other species will be included in the study as opportunities arise.</p>
<p>Blood samples have been obtained from nesting flatback turtles at Eighty Mile Beach and Thevenard Island. Necropsies were performed on numerous stranded turtles, including neonate flatback turtles found in a fish-kill event north of Broome and green and hawksbill turtles from various locations. Specialist&nbsp;parasitology training was provided by Dr David Blair who assisted in several necropsies at Murdoch University. Education messages about reducing plastics in our oceans were delivered after necropsies&nbsp;revealed high volumes of plastics in two green turtles.&nbsp;</p>

1756,2016,"<p>This study aimed to determine a current and accurate habitat-based population estimate of the Christmas Island hawk-owl (<em>Ninox natalis</em>), an endemic species of Christmas Island that is currently listed as Vulnerable (IUCN 2013). Owls were surveyed across five habitat types using call playback.&nbsp; The&nbsp;location data was analysed to calculate an overall population estimate based on owl territories per km<sup>2</sup> from estimated habitat densities. The call playback survey was conducted three times and covered approximately 42% of Christmas Island. Hawk-owls were present in 170 of the 402 survey site visits (approximately 40%) over the three surveys. The habitat class closed canopy rainforest had the highest average owl territory density with 1.91 hawk-owl territories per km<sup>2</sup>. The lowest density habitat class was non-vegetated areas (such as mine sites and settlement areas) with 0.41 hawk-owl territories per km<sup>2</sup>. The densities of the five habitat classes were extrapolated across the entire island to produce a total population estimate of 342 mature individuals. This current population estimate is significantly lower than past estimates of approximately 1000 mature individuals.&nbsp; Consequently&nbsp;it is recommend that the owl&rsquo;s current IUCN conservation classification be upgrading from Vulnerable to Endangered.</p>

Data from field studies in Fiji were then combined with information from the literature and meta analyses used to demonstrate biomass of fish in PHC is greater than in surrounding areas open to fishing.

3073,2021,"<p>In fire-prone ecosystems, recruitment from seeds following fire provides a pathway for populations to persist through fire. For many species, recruitment from seed is their only means of population recovery following fire events, so seed survival through fire is vital in order to maximise post-fire recruitment. This project aimed to measure temperatures within soil during fire, examine lethal tolerances of seeds to elevated temperatures associated with fire, establish interactions between lethal tolerances and emergence behaviour and predict weather conditions that may decrease seeds ability to survive fire events.</p>
<p>Key outcomes are: 1) a new method for measuring soil temperatures during fire using distributed temperature sensing within optic fibre to sample spatial and temporal patterns; 2) a negative relationship identified between seed moisture and lethal temperature thresholds; 3) analysis of fuel loads and temperature penetration into soils, the depth from which seeds can emerge from soils and their lethal temperature thresholds, and; 4) analysis of seasonal patterns of soil moisture and seed vulnerability to lethal temperatures. Findings include that while larger seeds can emerge from deeper within the soil, they are no better at surviving elevated soil temperatures, lethal temperatures are influenced by seed moisture which, in non physically dormant species, varies with season.</p>",10
1949,2017,"<p>Anthropogenic loss and fragmentation of natural habitats is now at unprecedented levels, making land use change one of the most important drivers affecting biodiversity. Within the southwest Western Australian biodiversity hotspot, the Swan Coastal Plain bioregion was historically cleared for agriculture and forestry, and is now experiencing extensive land clearing for urbanisation. <em>Conospermum undulatum</em> is a plant species endemic to the Swan Coastal Plain, and is now ranked as &lsquo;Vulnerable&rsquo; under Western Australia legislation. The significant reduction in population size, connectivity and density of remnant patches are likely to constrain the sexual reproduction of this species by altered plant-pollinator interactions and expression of inbreeding depression because of reduced gene flow between unrelated individuals. Moreover, putative hybrids between <em>C. undulatum</em> and more common <em>Conospermum</em> species have been identified on a morphological basis.</p>
<p>The present PhD project aims to address key research gaps in our knowledge of the rare <em>Conospermum undulatum</em> through an integrated study of the genetic diversity, contemporary pollen-mediated gene flow, pollinator behaviour, pollen limitation, and reproductive success of this plant species over its entire range. It also aims to genetically confirm the presence of hybrids and to assess whether genetic introgression is posing a risk to the species. The experimental design and methodology have been completed.

2103,2018,"<p>Gouldian finches benefitted from recent fire but are disadvantaged in their breeding by frequent fire. Nutritional benefits are derived from recent fire and low frequency fires, in terms of sorghum seed nutrient concentrations, which forms the dominant food source for the finch during the breeding season. The most successful breeding years are those after seasons with multiple small fires rather than seasons with a few large fires. This suggest that complex, fine grained fire mosaics are most beneficial to the Gouldian finch providing the greatest benefits in terms of breeding and feeding ecology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research in this project has highlighted the preference of Gouldian finches for burnt habitats in choice of breeding location. Finches preferred sites that were burnt infrequently (&lt;once in three years). There was a nutritional benefit to finches at infrequently burnt sites with sorghum seeds produced at such having a greater nutritional value. Finches also had greater breeding success at the regional level after years with many small patchy fires, rather than after years with few but large and intense fires. This could be related to less frequent fires being experienced at the patch scale leading to better nutrition for breeding finches. It could also reflect greater abundance of perennial grass seeds in the wet season in patches in between multiple small fires. Sites burnt in early fires had higher sorghum seed density the following year which could also benefit Gouldian finches.&nbsp;This study has been completed and papers are being prepared for publication.</p>",7
2862,2020,"<p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is endemic to south-west Australia and occupies seasonal wetlands whose hydroperiods are shortening due to declining rainfall. Trial translocations 300-400 kilometres south of their current habitat began in 2016 to test whether <em>P. umbrina</em> can grow in cooler climates where hydroperiods are likely to be more suitable in the future. Such intentional translocations of a species outside their indigenous range to mitigate climate change is known as assisted colonisation. Results of the recent assisted colonisation trials were mixed, and suitable food availability was thought to be a key component of a successful short trial in the east Augusta region. The main aim of this research is to understand whether energy requirements of the western swamp tortoise can be met in cooler climates. This will be achieved by: 1) developing novel environmental DNA methods to detect the species and determine their diet in new habitats; 2) documenting foraging behaviour in a southern wetland in relation to water temperatures and prey availability; and 3) linking metabolic processes and food intake to predict long-term rates of growth and reproduction of individuals released into new environments. This project will provide greater certainty on whether southern wetlands can provide viable habitat for this critically endangered species in the near future.</p>

1704,2016,"<p>Seaweed-dominated habitats occur in tropical reef systems, where they play vital roles in supporting key species and processes. Habitat quality in seaweed patches, measured as canopy height, holdfast density or percentage cover, varies seasonally and can be a major driver of the presence and abundance of key functional and taxonomic fish groups. However, the relative influence of other seascape variables, such as patch shape, size and proximity, remains poorly understood. This project will study seaweed habitats in the Ningaloo Marine Park, building on research in the region that has highlighted the importance of seaweed microhabitat and intra-patch structure by including patch and inter-patch measures. The study will focus on fishes of the family Labridae (Wrasses and Parrotfishes), which are a diverse group of conspicuous reef fishes, that span a wide range of trophic groups, body sizes, social structures, movement patterns and diel ranges. Specifically the project will: &nbsp;1) establish how within and between patch habitat structure influences reef fish diversity within the Ningaloo lagoon; 2) explore how patch habitat configuration influences fish predator-prey dynamics; and 3) quantify how seaweed-associated fish assemblages respond to acute and un-seasonal disturbances in patch-habitat condition.</p>

The study will test the hypotheses that with increasing fire severity, overstorey trees will exhibit higher levels of seedling recruitment and lower levels of epicormic resprouting, and that high severity fire will result in a more homogenous understorey dominated by plant species that are ephemeral or have attributes that make them successful as disturbance opportunists. Nine study sites were established sampling unburnt forest and forest burnt at low and high severity, as determined by crown scorch and defoliation. At each site, all trees within a 30 m x 30 m quadrat were measured for stem diameter and crown condition, and understorey species composition determined in five 4m<sup>2</sup> quadrats.

Ultimately, this project will provide a formal revision of the genus <em>Anthotium</em>, as well as a full morphometric assessment and an updated phylogeny of the genus. To fulfil these aims the variation between these three taxa will be quantified through Landmarking and Elliptic Fourier morphometric analysis (EFA) and phylogenetic and multivariate analysis of Sanger DNA sequences.

Both species were more abundant as distance further from boat ramps increased. In addition, white tip reef sharks, were strongly influenced by the underlying structural complexity of the reef and were more abundant at places where the structural complexity of the reef was highly variable. These results indicate that proximity to boat ramps has a negative influence on shark abundance at Ningaloo, although the strength of this relationship varies among species, and for white tip sharks habitat is a better predictor of abundance.

2341,2018,"<p>Ecological restoration, largely using direct seeding, is commonly used in dryland systems that have been adversely impacted by intensive land management and industrial activities such as mining. However, direct seeding commonly results in less than 5% plant establishment. In drylands, plant recruitment is most constrained during germination and emergence, when plants are particularly sensitive to harsh environmental and edaphic conditions. Ensuring reliable and predictable plant establishment requires an understanding of species-specific germination traits and dormancy break requirements. Seed enhancements can further aid plant performance in the field. This project is addressing specific knowledge gaps in the use of seeds for restoration of drylands in two regions subject to large-scale degradation - a cold desert (Great Basin) in the western United States and a hot desert (Pilbara) in north-west Western Australia.</p>
<p>The project has produced first systematic investigation of seed dormancy and germination traits for 26 species of the Great Basin that are important for restoration in this region. A focus on dormancy-break of four herbaceous perennials demonstrated these species germinate in late winter or early spring, but that the thermal germination envelope is species-dependent, resulting in different germination niches. Cold stratification was most effective at promoting dormancy loss among all species. Chemical stimulants promoted germination in three species and may be a fast-acting alternative for seed pre-treatment. An examination of the effects of temperature- and abrasion-based on dormancy loss of seeds with physical dormancy found that abrasion-based techniques were most effective. Pneumatic scarification significantly enhanced germination and appears to be a fast, safe, and effective method with a potential to be scaled up for operational use. The development of seed enhancement technologies focused on <em>Triodia pungens</em> as a key grass species in the Pilbara, including the effects of seed priming and coating, and their combination, on seedling recruitment across differing levels of water availability. Priming promoted the highest germination, emergence, seedling size, and root development, and enabled establishment conditions. When not combined with priming, coating had a negative effect on seedling performance. Under non-limiting moisture, priming and coating resulted in the largest seedlings.</p>",7
1959,2017,"<p><em>Tecticornia</em> (family Chenopodiaceae) is a genus of succulent, salt-tolerant plants. The genus includes two species identified as using the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway and 39 species currently categorised as C<sub>3</sub> plants. A number of species are endemic to Western Australia, where they play a key ecological role in salt-affected areas. <em>Tecticornia</em> species are difficult to identify, and have low genetic diversity. The relationships between species are not clear, and current phylogenies are unresolved.&nbsp; This study aims to investigate the steps in the evolution of C<sub>4 </sub>photosynthesis in the genus <em>Tecticornia</em> at the cell, protein and transcript levels. This project also aims to resolve relationships between species, and identify any potential C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate species in the genus.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA has been extracted from dried herbarium tissue and the ETS region was amplified from 65 <em>Tecticornia</em> species, and the sequences determined. ETS sequences were used to construct maximum likelihood and Bayesian trees. Additional ITS sequences were also obtained, and added to the ITS data previously obtained. Additional ITS and ETS sequences were provided from chloroplast genome sequencing of <em>Tecticornia</em> species completed by Andrew Hall and Prof. Ian Small, as part of another project. ETS and ITS phylogenetic trees showed similar topology, and combined trees showed greater resolution of species compared to previous studies. The ETS and ITS combined phylogeny resolved taxa into 12 strongly supported clades. However, the backbone of the phylogeny remains unresolved, and the relationships between these clades are not clear. The aim of constructing the phylogeny was to determine which C3 species are most closely related to the C4 <em>Tecticornia</em> species. The C4 species formed a highly supported clade.</p>

2272,2018,"<p><em>Banksia seminuda</em> subsp. <em>remanens</em> and <em>B. occidentalis</em> subsp. <em>formosa</em> from Western Australia&rsquo;s south coast were described as subspecies in the late 1980s based on differences in leaf morphology, canopy density and height between them and their common subspecies. However, this status has since been rejected and has led to dispute over their current classification. Historically, taxonomic decisions such as these have been based primarily on morphological traits, an approach that has provided many correct classifications. However, morphology alone is not always the most appropriate basis for assessment as it is not always under genetic control and therefore heritable, and where morphological differences are minor or variable (such as between infraspecies) differentiating taxa may not be possible by simple visual examination. These issues are further compounded by a lack of consensus on infraspecific definitions, characters to delimit them, and the degree of differentiation that constitutes recognition as distinct taxa. Nonetheless, contemporary analysis techniques in morphometrics and genomics are providing insight into taxonomic inconsistencies that may assist in resolving taxonomic boundaries. This research seeks to obtain information to resolve the subspecific classifications given for <em>B. seminuda</em> subsp. <em>remanens</em> and <em>B. occidentalis</em> subsp. <em>formosa</em>, hypothesising that both do constitute distinct subspecies. This project aims to conduct morphometric analyses to determine statistically how respective subspecies differ in their morphology; perform genomic sequencing of nuclear DNA to determine the presence and level of genotypic variation within and between respective subspecies; and finally, use this information to determine subspecies delimitation in each species.</p>
<p>Samples of leaves were collected for morphometric and genomic analysis from populations of <em>B. seminuda</em> subsp. <em>remanens</em> and <em>B. occidentalis</em> subsp. <em>formosa</em> on coastal headlands, along with populations of their common subspecies.

2117,2018,"<p>Seaweed-dominated habitats occur in tropical reef systems, where they play vital roles in supporting key species and processes. Habitat quality in seaweed patches, measured as canopy height, holdfast density or percentage cover, varies seasonally and can be a major driver of the presence and abundance of key functional and taxonomic fish groups. However, the relative influence of other seascape variables, such as patch shape, size and proximity, remains poorly understood. This project will study seaweed habitats at Ningaloo Marine Park, building on research in the region that has highlighted the importance of seaweed micro-habitat and intra-patch structure by including patch and inter-patch measures. The study will focus on fishes of the family Labridae (wrasses and parrotfishes), which are a diverse group of conspicuous reef fishes that span a wide range of trophic groups, body sizes, social structures, movement patterns and diel ranges. Specifically the project will: (1) establish how within and between patch habitat structure influences reef fish diversity within the Ningaloo lagoon; (2) explore how patch habitat configuration influences fish predator-prey dynamics; and (3) quantify how seaweed-associated fish assemblages respond to acute and unseasonal disturbances in patch-habitat condition.</p>
<p>All field data for this project has been collected and writing has commenced. A paper from this work has been accepted for publication in <em>Landscape Ecology</em>. The paper demonstrates that both seascape measures of connectivity among habitats and within patch measures of canopy structure are important predictors of fish diversity and should be considered in conservation planning.&nbsp;</p>",7

2125,2018,"<p>Periodically harvested closures (PHCs) are a common form of fisheries management in Melanesia. However, it is unclear how effective PHCs are in maintaining the abundance of target species. This project initially identified suitable methods (diver operated video) and indicators (fish behaviour and biomass) for detecting changes in fish assemblages. Data from field studies in Fiji were then combined with information from the literature and meta-analyses used to demonstrate biomass of fish in PHCs is greater than in surrounding areas open to fishing. Analyses also found that to be successful, PHCs need to be closed to fishing for a considerable period of time, must be large, old and have high levels of fisher compliance.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;project has been completed and papers published. A meta-analysis published in the <em>Journal of Applied Ecology</em> found fish abundance often increases in tabu areas making harvest easier for fishers; however, the long-term benefits of this management practice to conservation are equivocal.

Further development of this critical step will be needed to develop successful desiccation for recalcitrant-seeded species. Preliminary analysis of the lipid content of cell membranes shows significant differences between species and tissue type abundancy of sterol glucosides, sterol esters, phytosterols and glycerolipids. No large double-bond index differences between species or tissue types were observed. The preliminary data suggests that the best possibility of getting post-cryopreservation survival for embryonic axes of both species is with selection bases on maturity and the use of longer cryo-protective agents incubation time.</p>",7
2335,2018,"<p>Compared to other regions around the globe, the South West Australian Floristic Region has an exceptionally high incidence of plant species that are predominantly pollinated by vertebrates, with approximately 2,000 species pollinated by birds.

Ecological genetic studies are required to assess these consequences, and their implications for the evolution and conservation of these plants. &nbsp;A combination of genetic techniques and field experiments with <em>Eucalyptus caesia</em>&nbsp;will be used to examine three critical issues in pollination ecology and reproductive biology: (1) the relative contribution of native and introduced animals to pollen dispersal in plants adapted for bird pollination; (2) whether genetic factors such as heterozygosity and sibling relatedness influence patterns of seedling recruitment and survival over time; and (3) the consequences of bird pollination in range-wide genetic diversity.</p>

2329,2018,"<p>Over time, the diversity of plant species present in restoration sites decreases. In particular, many seedlings die after their second summer of growth. The exact cause of this mortality is unknown, though numerous factors may contribute to seedling death including herbivory, pathogen attack, and competition for limited resources, such as water and nutrients. This research project is investigating: (1) what do spatial patterns among species reveal about the importance of competition and facilitation in early and mid-successional stages of community development following restoration?; (2) how do pairwise interactions between nitrogen fixing and non-nitrogen fixing seedlings affect their persistence or establishment (assuming 'establishment' is a seedling that survives past its second summer)?; and (3) does using varying densities of an annual grass (<em>Austrostipa</em><em> compressa</em>) facilitate growth of seedlings from topsoil transfer?&nbsp;</p>

Knowledge of morphology and reproductive strategy remain poorly known. The species is currently listed as Critically Endangered and occurs in ecological communities that are threatened by feral pig damage, increased fire frequency, weed invasion, fluctuations in&nbsp;water quality and changes to land use, such as groundwater extraction and land clearing.

2094,2018,"<p>Anthropogenic loss and fragmentation of natural habitats on the Swan Coastal Plain has been increasing during the last 60 years, making land use change one of the most important drivers affecting biodiversity. <em>Conospermum undulatum</em> is an endemic&nbsp;plant species of the Swan Coastal Plain, and is now ranked as &lsquo;Vulnerable&rsquo; under Western Australia legislation. The significant reduction in population size, connectivity and density of remnant patches are likely to constrain the sexual reproduction of this species by altered plant-pollinator interactions and expression of inbreeding depression because of reduced gene flow between unrelated individuals. Moreover, putative hybrids between <em>C. undulatum</em> and more common <em>Conospermum</em> species have been identified on a morphological basis.</p>
<p>During the 2017 flowering season, data was collected from 210 individuals in 12 populations looking for differences in fruit and seed production, and seedling germination and mortality, among different populations. Results indicate that plant reproductive effort is not affected by any of the population variables. However, the proportion of seeds produced per inflorescence is positively and significantly related to population size, connectivity and floral display, indicating that habitat fragmentation is posing a threat to this endemic species. Interestingly, fruit production per inflorescence appears to be affected only by the population floral display,&nbsp;that is, the potential of the population to attract pollinators. This result suggests that, besides pollen limitation, genetic factors that prevent the development of the embryo and result in empty fruits may be present in small and disconnected populations. More ecological surveys during the 2018 flowering season are planned and a microsatellite library has been developed to investigate the genetics of&nbsp;<em>C. undulatum.</em></p>

2104,2018,"<p>This study was designed to investigate aspects of mammal decline in northern Australia using northern quoll, scaly tailed possums and golden backed tree rats as exemplar species under threat across the landscape from altered ecosystem processes such as changed fire regimes and predation by introduced predators.</p>
<p>The study has demonstrated that terrain ruggedness increased connectedness among northern quoll populations, while open habitats acted as an ecological barrier to gene flow. Golden backed tree rats and scaly tailed possums were found to benefit from the presence of unburnt habitats including rainforests and hollow bearing trees. However, both species also used burnt landscape elements for foraging, while avoiding some long unburnt habitats such as Triodia grasslands. These results emphasise the need for fine-grained fire mosaics, with a mix of burnt and unburnt habitat. Feral cats were found to have much lower occupancy rates in rugged sandstone habitats, even in the presence of increased mammal prey, than in open, structurally simple savanna habitats. This explains some of the reason small mammals may be scarce in open savanna vegetation, particularly after fire. This project is now completed.</p>",7
2339,2018,"<p>Restoration of degraded land following mining is challenged by factors including the limited availability of natural topsoil, low soil fertility in overburden substrates, exotic species invasion, and complex scheduling constraints on rehabilitation efforts. This project aims to address some of the problems faced in restoration in the Pilbara, focussing on: assessing the effectiveness of current practices of applying inorganic soil amendments in re-instating soil function, and improving seedling recruitment and survival; and exploring alternative amendments, including organic amendments, to improve plant establishment and long-term ecosystem sustainability.</p>
<p>Glasshouse experiments investigating the effects of the inorganic amendments urea and gypsum on seedling emergence have been completed. Results showed that soil amendments had limited influence on seed germination, and may be detrimental to seedling emergence and increase seedling mortality. However, plant growth was improved in alternative substrates when high doses of inorganic soil amendments were applied. The use of soil amendments in mine rehabilitation requires consideration of the trade-off between initial reductions in seed recruitment with later-stage seedling development. Field-based experiments in the Pilbara have been monitored at six-monthly intervals for soil respiration, plant photosynthesis, plant biomass and coverage, and soil nutrient and microbial analyses. Trials on a rock waste dump on a Pilbara minesite are monitored at quarterly intervals to determine the effects of inorganic (urea and gypsum) and organic (biochar, <em>Triodia</em> biomass) amendments on soil properties (microbial activity and diversity, soil nutrients) and seedling emergence and growth.</p>",7
2114,2018,"<p>This project aims to improve our understanding of the nexus between Noongar culture and contemporary floristic distributions, ultimately informing both biodiversity conservation in the South-West Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR) and connection of Noongar people with Country. Through collaborative research with southern coastal Noongar Elders and archaeologists, the project explores how specific cultural activities may have influenced biodiversity within the SWAFR through a series of investigations examining vegetation patterns and processes. Specific areas of focus include testing for evidence of Noongar plant resource concentration around cultural nodes and botanical differentiation between nodes of varying historic cultural use; phylogeographical investigation of culturally important taxa in the genus <em>Platysace</em>; investigations of resource concentration effects of edible<em> Platysace</em> tuber harvest; and an analysis of Noongar land use patterns in relation to landscape age and propensity to disturbance.</p>
<p>The phylogeographical work is testing the hypothesis that humans are a historical vector influencing the distribution of the staple Noongar food species,&nbsp;<em>P.&nbsp;deflexa</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>P. trachymeniodes</em>.

Noncoding chloroplast DNA regions, trnS-trnG52S, trnV-ndhc and psbD-trnT were examined in a total of 239 individuals, using a range of analytical tools. Genetic patterns in the species were different, supporting expectations based on aboriginal use. The pattern in <em>P. effusa</em> (which has no known cultural significance) showed a general pattern of high population divergence, low gene flow and multiple refugia, consistent with a long evolutionary history and past climatic oscillations and persistence in a highly fragmented landscape. In contrast, patterns in <em>P.&nbsp;deflexa</em> and the southeastern part of the range of <em>P.&nbsp;trachymenioides</em> showed higher gene flow estimates, less divergence between populations, and ancestral common haplotypes that are consistent with anthropogenic influences.

This project seeks to enhance conservation of northern quolls in the Pilbara by providing managers with a better understanding of the threats most likely to impact population persistence. Specifically, this project aims to: (1) calculate monitoring effort required to effectively assess occupancy changes in northern quoll populations; (2) assess how factors, such as fire frequency, habitat structure and predator densities, influence quoll occupancy; and (3) examine fine scale habitat use by northern quolls using GPS collars at various sites across the Pilbara.</p>
<p>Significant progress has been made across all three aims. Using pre-existing live trapping and camera trapping data we have modelled the comparative effectiveness of both methods in detecting changes in occupancy. This data will be implemented within continuing survey and monitoring efforts to ensure project resources are distributed in a cost efficient manner. Cameras traps spread over 120 sites in operation for a combined total of over 23,600 traps nights collected 1,501 northern quoll detections along with hundreds of feral cat and wild dog detections. By combining this data with detailed habitat assessments, we are in the process of constructive comprehensive occupancy models that will provide crucial insight into the way in which quolls interact with both predators and their environment.

This project will expand on the success of flash flaming demonstrated for <em>Triodia</em> species to other native species required for restoration through researching flash flaming procedures and settings for various native species, the development of a predictive model that describes the relations between the surface features of seeds and the optimal flash flaming procedures and settings, and the design and construction of new seed processing equipment including improved, large-scale flash flaming machinery.</p>
<p>Testing of flaming has been conducted on seeds of a number of new species, including those of <em>Austrodanthonia</em>, <em>Chloris</em>, <em>Cymbopogon</em>, <em>Eriachne</em>, <em>Gomphrena</em>, <em>Ptilotus</em>&nbsp;and <em>Stirlingia</em>. Results demonstrate that for all species, flaming can successfully improve seed geometry with little to no impact on seed germination. Design of an improved seed flaming machine has been completed and the construction of a second and third flaming machine has commenced for future testing. Improvements to the original design include incorporation of a gear box into the motor to allow for continuous operation at low RPM over extended time periods, modifications to the inlet hopper, modification of stirring bars inside the drum, and automatic ignition of the burners.</p>",7
2323,2018,"<p>Restoration of native plant communities through direct seeding often have low seedling establishment success rates. A significant factor in restoring post pine and degraded agricultural lands back to native vegetation is competition with invasive weed species, and as native seedlings are susceptible to herbicide application, weed control strategies are limited. This project will examine how seed pelleting technologies can be applied to biodiverse <em>Banksia</em> woodland species to protect seeds from herbicide application and offer innovative weed control strategies for restoration in high weed load environments.</p>

2305,2018,"<p>Seagrass plays an important role in the Swan Canning Riverpark by stabilising sediment and maintaining oxygen levels at the sediment/water interface. It is also an important food source for the black swan and is thought to support diverse and productive faunal assemblages. However, much of the information about the value of this habitat is gleaned from <em>Zostera</em> species in estuaries elsewhere. Relatively little is known of the biodiversity and ecological value of <em>Halophila ovalis</em>, the dominant species in the Riverpark. Macroalgae are commonly found in the lower reaches of the Riverpark in late spring and summer, and in recent years, large amounts of the macroalga <em>Chaetomorpha linum</em> have accumulated in response to favourable growth conditions. The macroalgae is fast-growing and is often considered a nuisance because it reduces light conditions to <em>Halophila</em> beds and can affect reproduction. This project is investigating the&nbsp;biodiversity and ecological values of <em>Halophila</em> meadows and <em>Chaetomorpha</em> accumulations. It will also determine the ecological value of accumulated wrack. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Two seasons of sampling invertebrates and fish communities have been completed. A major flood event in February 2017&nbsp;impacted a third sampling event by causing major seagrass die-off. Stable isotope was delayed due to laboratory availability.</p>",7
2098,2018,"<p>This project will examine mycorrhizal community parameters (abundance, ratios of arbuscular (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) associations and diversity) of selected host species in revegetation areas compared with nearby remnant bushland. The study is being undertaken within the Fitz-Stirling bioregion in the south of Western Australia, in sites that form part of the Gondwanalink restoration initiative. Additionally, a growth experiment will be undertaken using site-collected soils to help further decipher the underlying causes for observed responses. These findings may be used to guide revegetation practices in the future, and provide suggestions for the best chance of reinstating or maintaining natural mycorrhizal communities.</p>
<p>Mycorrhizal community parameters of selected host species were examined in revegetation areas compared with nearby remnant bushland with two types of mycorrhizal associations, arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal, investigated for abundance through root colonization counts. A growth experiment using site-collected soils and field studies were used to assess mycorrhizal presence and abundance. No clear differences were found in mycorrhizal root colonization levels between the revegetated sites and their associated remnant bushland. These findings suggest, that at least for the&nbsp;mycorrhizal associations investigated, mycorrhizal recovery in these revegetated sites has resulted in levels now comparable to adjacent remnant bushland.</p>",7
2308,2018,"<p>Dibblers (<em>Parantechinus apicalis</em>) are ranked as Endangered and have a limited area of occupancy in the south west and on islands off the midwest coast.&nbsp;Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught dibblers is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Dibblers are one of the species intended for reintroduction to Dirk Hartog Island following cat and goat eradication, and this will be achieved through captive breeding of animals sourced from the midwest islands. The aims of this project are: (1) produce a literature review of the Dasyuridae family with a specific focus on dibblers; (2) identify known hazards associated with the dibbler translocation and undertake a risk assessment; (3) investigate how commensal or potentially pathogenic parasites can be conserved through modification of therapeutic regimes to ensure native parasites are maintained in the reintroduced population; (4) consider disease risk management options and advise on future screening protocols for dibbler translocations; (5) supplement existing knowledge by collecting samples from wild caught animals for the captive breeding program for disease screening; and (6) present a summary of findings and the implications for managing future dibbler translocations.</p>
<p>Biological samples were collected from dibblers on the Jurien Bay Islands and from animals previously collected from the islands and transferred to Perth Zoo. Samples have been analysed and identified.</p>",7
2344,2018,"<p>Seed use in restoration is largely inefficient as a large number of native species are incompatible with direct seeding machinery due to complex morphological properties and attributes of seeds that cause blockages in conventional seeding machinery. Surface features of native seeds/fruits can comprise dense hairs, awns and lobes, causing them to block commercial drill seeders. This project aims to analyse current seed distribution methods and to design, construct, and test new multi-native species drill seeders compatible with seed of diverse native species for use in large scale restoration and rehabilitation. The primary objectives of such a drill seeder include the capability for controlling seed depth and spacing, sowing at rates applicable to large-scale restoration, and seeding over diverse landforms including rocky and sloping land.</p>
<p>An online survey was designed and circulated in 2018 to the international seed and restoration community to identify common limitations to direct seeding. There were 183 respondents to the survey, with the primary findings being that current direct seeding machinery lacks adequate controlling of seed sowing depth and spatial distribution, and that there is an inability to sow seeds of complex morphology over complex topographies. Experimental components of this project include field-trials in the Pilbara examining the optimal emergence depth of seeds of <em>Triodia pungens</em>. Results showed that broadcasting seed on the soil surface results in almost no germination, and that covering seeds to a depth of 5 mm yields optimal seedling emergence. Seedling emergence declines considerably at 10 mm depth, and almost no emergence occurs at 30 mm depth. Most mechanical seeders currently in operation are unable to control depth to this level of precision, particularly in the rocky and uneven terrain associated with mine waste dumps. Future designs of modifications to seeding machinery will focus on improving depth control in these conditions. Some initial modifications to current seeding techniques have been trialled through attaching an agricultural soil scarifier to the seeding unit, and testing of other purpose-designed and built prototype modifications aimed at precision incorporation of seeds into the soil.</p>",7
2303,2018,"<p>Understanding the historic conditions of the Swan-Canning Estuary is important to help predict future conditions and guide management activities. This project aims to identify spatial and temporal patterns in the phytoplankton community of the estuary and relate these to environmental drivers. Phytoplankton and a range of environmental variables have been monitored across the estuary since 1994; however, this long-term data set has not been extensively analysed. Multivariate analyses of the phytoplankton data and correlation with key hydrological and physico-chemical variables will facilitate the characterisation of current and past phytoplankton community patterns and their drivers across space and time.</p>
<p>Predictions for future phytoplankton dynamics will be made for the system, by applying historical relationships between phytoplankton and environmental drivers to modelled predicted hydrological and climatic trends.

2081,2018,"<p>This project is part of the Ningaloo Outlook CSIRO-BHP research partnership and is investigating green turtle foraging ecology and energetics. This outcome will be achieved by: (1) investigating the diet and variation in diet between size/age classes using stable isotope analysis; (2) describe the movement of foraging and nesting green turtles using satellite tags; and (3) use dynamic energy budget modelling to investigate allocation to growth and reproduction throughout the lifecycle.</p>
<p>Fieldwork was conducted in January 2018 to assist with satellite tagging and collection of stable isotope samples from nesting female green turtles. Laboratory work has commenced to prepare stable isotope samples for analysis. The results obtained from embryonic development and dynamic energy budget modelling studies were presented at the Ningaloo Outlook Symposium in March 2018.

2089,2018,"<p>This study aims to improve the understanding of the numbat population in the Upper Warren region (UWR), to inform management for the conservation of this endangered species. The objectives are to develop robust survey methods for numbat population monitoring, and to determine anthropogenic and environmental factors influencing the population.</p>
<p>To establish methods suitable for numbat monitoring in the UWR, fieldwork was conducted over two seasons (spring and autumn) to test driven transects, searches for numbat signs (diggings and scats), and camera-trap techniques (stationary and roving Reconyx and Swift-wide-angle camera models). Numbat detections from driven transects and camera-traps were too low to provide meaningful population measures. Searches for numbat signs returned promising results deemed suitable for occupancy modelling that incorporates detection probabilities. For upcoming fieldwork seasons, numbat sign searches will be designed to apply occupancy modelling approaches. Relationships between environmental variables including fire, timber harvesting and feral predator control and the UWR numbat population will be explored.</p>",7
2076,2018,"<p>The burrowing bettong (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) is a threatened macropod isolated to three offshore islands off the coast of Western Australia. As a result of geographical isolation, <em>B. lesueur</em> has been found to consist of two genetically distinct populations, which are currently listed as different subspecies. Multiple translocation attempts have been made to reintroduce <em>B. lesueur</em> back to mainland Australia, with Matuwa, located in the Goldfields region of Western Australia, being the first to establish a reintroduced population admixed from the two genetically distinct source locations. However, the genetic and demographic consequences of mixing genetically distinct populations is yet to be fully understood. Thus, through the use of next generation sequencing using reduced representation methods, this study aims to investigate the introgression between these two geographically isolated source populations and assess how this impacts genetic diversity and fitness across different generations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, DNA extractions have been completed on 192 boodie samples from Matuwa encompassing samples from 2010-2017. These have been sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility&nbsp;for processing for ddRADseq analysis. Analysis of trapping data is underway to estimate survivorship and fecundity of the sampled individuals. A literature review and research proposal have been completed.</p>",7
2326,2018,"<p>Plant physiological condition is a key indicator in the early stages of restoration progress assessment. Current methods to determine condition are difficult to undertake over large areas and are time consuming. This research project aims to determine if near-surface remote sensing measurements (particularly hyperspectral sensing and thermography) can reliably quantify plant drought stress condition in a biodiverse plant community. Quantitative criteria will be proposed to evaluate restoration success by defining a fast, accurate and easy to perform methodology, and potentially establishing the foundation for scaling up to more remote imaging platforms that allow monitoring of larger areas in shorter periods of time.</p>
<p>Several methods are currently being trialled to link plant stress responses with leaf spectral signatures including: (1) undertaking controlled drought experiments to determine optimal measurement methods for the two technologies; (2) initiating a multi-year monitoring experiment within restored systems and; (3) installing field irrigation experiments to assess the drought responses of plant&nbsp;species.</p>",7
2215,2018,"<p>The jarrah (<em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>) and karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>) forests of south-west Western Australia are important sources of timber, wildlife habitat and water. However, as climate changes, issues such as timber production, tree health and mortality, and water yield need to be addressed. Individual-based modelling (IBM) is an ecological modelling approach that represents the individuals within populations or communities, and the interactions between them, with a relatively high level of detail and complexity. This study aims to develop an IBM of tree growth in water limited environments, to parameterise the model for jarrah and karri and to predict the impact of tree thinning on timber production, tree health and mortality and water yield using time series data collected from 1965 and 1992, respectively.</p>
<p>A research proposal has been submitted&nbsp;and&nbsp;approved. Supplementary data for jarrah stand dynamics was recently collected. Supplementary data for karri stand dynamics will be collected in the coming summer months.&nbsp;A theoretical IBM is in the developmental phase. Field data analysis has recently commenced. After the theoretical IBM has been developed, the field data will be used to parametrize the tree growth model in a water limited environment. Effects of thinning on timber and water yield will then be simulated for the next 80 to 100 years using the model.</p>",7
2336,2018,"<p>This research aims to provide a comprehensive test of the influence of climatic and edaphic variation on the performance of genotypes from multiple provenances, to identify best-practice seed sourcing for restoration. Although many strategies for seed sourcing have been proposed, there are few empirical tests of different strategies. In this project, multiple genetic provenances of <em>Banksia menziesii</em>, a restoration priority plant species on the Swan Coastal Plain, will be tested in post-mining rehabilitation field sites, as well as glasshouse growth trials where environmental parameters will be modified. In addition, physical, chemical and biological properties of soils from these multiple source sites will be assessed and compared to the performance of seeds sourced from these sites.</p>
<p>Field trials have been established and initial monitoring conducted. Soil microbiome analyses have been conducted and data are being analysed. Glasshouse growth trials with seedlings sourced from six provenances showed overall decreased stomatal conductance and decreased leaf water potential under low treatment. However, there was no provenance effect in either of these measures. Of most significance was that all the seedlings of northern provenances, Kalbarri and Eneabba, survived under low water treatments. Mortality was significant for all other provenances, providing evidence that northern provenance seedlings are more resilient to drought stress.</p>",7
3281,2022,"<p>Salt lakes are an iconic feature of Western Australian semi-arid and arid landscapes, with a flora and fauna that have adapted and diversified within these extreme environments. Western Australia has a very diverse halophilic fauna, higher than anywhere else in Australia. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing (especially in the Wheatbelt) and increasingly, by mining on or near the lake bed. One of the most intriguing invertebrate groups is the snail genus <em>Coxiella</em>, which tolerates both periodic drying and high salinities and is the only mollusc occurring in temporarily filled salt lakes. This project focusses on the taxonomy, ecology and evolutionary history of this genus.</p>
<p>A taxonomic assessment of <em>Coxiella</em> has been completed which identified a total of 14 species, with six considered to be new species indicating that the diversity of this group has been underestimated. The taxonomic study also included a South-African genus <em>Tomichia </em>to test the hypothesis that these genera were once a Gondwanan assemblage. The genetic analyses found that <em>Coxiella </em>and <em>Tomichia </em>formed a monophyletic clade relative to outgroup taxa suggesting an ancient relationship between these genera. Physiological experiments on the salinity tolerances of 6 <em>Coxiella </em>species were also undertaken. The results suggested that although all <em>Coxiella </em>species can persist across a wide range of salinities (~5 &ndash; 70 mS/cm) some species are much more tolerant of higher salinities than others. <em>Coxiella </em>n. sp 2 in particular was able to tolerate salinities of ~ 135 mS/cm without displaying significant levels of mortality, suggesting that this species may be one of the most salt tolerant gastropods globally.</p>",11

2091,2018,"<p><em>Banksia</em> woodlands of the Swan Coastal Plain are part of the south-west Western Australian biodiversity hotspot and have been subjected to extensive clearing. These <em>Banksia</em> woodlands are now listed as a threatened ecological community (TEC) by the Commonwealth through the <em>EPBC Act.</em>&nbsp;There are numerous floristic community types (FCTs) within <em>Banksia</em> woodlands, of which several are threatened. An example is the Swan Coastal Plain floristic community type 20a (SCP20a) (<em>Banksia attenuata</em> woodlands with species rich dense shrublands). The threatening processes impacting on&nbsp;<em>Banksia</em> woodland include further land clearing, fragmentation, weed invasion, inappropriate fire regimes, altered hydrological processes, disease due to <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> and a drying climate. This project aims to address knowledge gaps for improving the understanding of <em>Banksia</em> woodland floristic communities with a focus on SCP20a through a meta-analysis of Swan Coastal Plain data, combined with targeted assessment of new sites and re-assessment of existing sites with the aim of detecting change. The study also aims to integrate spatial analysis of environmental factors with biological data to identify predictive capability and assess risk to <em>Banksia</em> woodlands using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria, with reference to alternative risk assessment techniques.</p>
<p>Targeted field surveys were completed in the second half of 2017 for a selection of SCP20a sites. Acquisition of additional SCP floristic plot data has been made through collaboration with other researchers and data custodians. The development of a floristic meta-dataset for the SCP is in progress to review the position of <em>Banksia</em> woodlands within the context of improved availability of survey data acquired since the original FCTs were defined.

2334,2018,"<p>Pollinator services underpin the function and sustainability of most terrestrial ecosystems. Optimal foraging theory predicts that the majority of pollen dispersed by animals will be among the nearest neighbours. However, pollen carryover, and differences in the movement behaviour between vertebrates and invertebrate pollinators, will affect paternity in natural plant populations. The South West Australian Floristic Region has the highest incidence of vertebrate pollination worldwide. Recent studies suggest that almost near random mating may occur in populations of plants pollinated by highly mobile nectar feeding bird species. This research project aims to address the consequences of bird pollination on mating, spatial genetic structure, and fitness in kangaroo paws.</p>
<p>A combination of pollinator observations, exclusion experiments and molecular analysis for paternity assignment have been used to track pollinator behaviour and pollen dispersal within populations of <em>Anigozanthos manglesii</em>. Results indicate that nectar-feeding birds (honeyeaters) are critical for effective pollination of <em>A. manglesii</em>, inbreeding depression is associated with selfing and nearest neighbour mating, and there is a decline in reproductive success with increasing mate distance.</p>",7
2312,2018,"<p><em>Geocrinia alba&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>G. vitellina</em>&nbsp;have a restricted distribution and are listed as Critically Endangered and Vulnerable. These frogs lay large clutches of eggs; however, the survival rate to adult frogs is low.

Eggs clutches of both species&nbsp;are collected from the wild and metamorphs are raised&nbsp;and subsequently&nbsp;released. This project is part of the ongoing research and husbandry management to achieve regular and reliable captive breeding in both species.</p>
<p>Surveys have shown that soil moisture and temperature can indicate whether a&nbsp;<em>G. alba</em> or <em>G. vitellina</em> population has been stable, or has declined. Sites where frogs are present have cool and stable temperatures and it is thought that warmer temperatures may be unsuitable for these species. The main aim of this research is to quantify the effect of temperature on development times of <em>Geocrinia</em> embryos, in order to estimate development rates across a range of realistic field temperatures. A development rate function fitted to this empirical data will allow estimation of the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and will infer temperatures at which exposure would be lethal. An embryo collection trip and subsequent nest splitting was undertaken, with seven wild <em>G. vitellina</em> clutches being collected, containing 86 fresh embryos. Embryos were incubated at various temperatures and monitored. Warmer temperatures (25&deg;C and above) resulted in abnormalities and mortality.

The aim of this project is to determine the role of Kyphosids in algal herbivory in reef ecosystems, and the factors affecting their grazing activity.</p>
<p>The study found Kyphosids were more abundant in high-relief areas and juveniles mainly inhabited shallow inshore reefs, suggesting these are important nursery habitats. Dietary analyses demonstrated that sympatric and morphologically similar species can assume different functional roles (i.e. as browsers or grazers), inferring that species level identifications are required in monitoring and research programs to avoid erroneous estimates of herbivorous activity.&nbsp;This project has been&nbsp;completed and a manuscript is being prepared.</p>",7
2327,2018,"<p>The importance of soil biological properties such as microbial composition and the benefits conferred to soils and plants are often undervalued in mine site restoration. Microorganisms have been widely reported to be beneficial for agricultural crops (e.g. growth stimulation, increased nutrient uptake, plant tolerance against abiotic stress such as drought) through inducement by microbial signals, such as phytohormones and enzymes. Some of these beneficial microorganisms are also present in natural soil systems; however, their role in facilitating seedling establishment is yet to be identified. This project aims to investigate if microorganisms known to benefit agricultural species can be identified and isolated from the Western Australian natural systems.

2508,2019,"<p>A program of monitoring vegetation, groundwater and wetland fauna at 25 wetlands in the Wheatbelt Region was undertaken as part of the department's contribution to the State Salinity Strategy, with a wetland fauna component running from 1996 to 2012. The original focus of the program was to determine the ongoing effects of salinity on biodiversity in representative wetlands. However, declining rainfall became another important process affecting wetlands during the project. Some of this data has been analysed and written up for individual wetlands, but trends in diversity across the wetlands had not been examined. This project aimed to examine the influence of rainfall and wetland inundation on the alpha, beta and gamma diversity of invertebrates, and investigate patterning in aquatic plant seed bank diversity.</p>
<p>Analyses demonstrated a strong relationship between wetland hydrology (depth and proportion of wetlands that were dry) and both alpha and gamma diversity of invertebrates. This manifested as a decline in alpha and gamma diversity over time as wetlands became increasingly shallower and drier during the study period. By contrast, beta diversity remained high as each wetland retained a distinct fauna when water was present. These results suggest that if the Wheatbelt continues to experience declining rainfall then the range of species inhabiting the region's wetlands is likely to decline significantly.</p>",8

The study is examining the response of vegetation structure and composition to different levels of fire severity across four vegetation types (tall open eucalypt forest, open eucalypt forest, <em>Melaleuca</em>/<em>Allocasuarina</em> forest, <em>Banksia</em>/<em>Acacia</em> heathland). Fire severity is being determined from remotely sensed imagery. Field data are being collected at 48 sites and include details of overstorey composition and crown condition, understorey composition and cover, fungal community composition, soil nutrients and samples for analysis of fungal metagenomics. Seeds of dominant understorey species are also being tested to investigate temperature thresholds for survival during fire. To date, sites have been selected and initial site characterisations have been undertaken. Findings from an Honours study of initial post-fire vegetation recovery during the first year after fire are being prepared for publication.</p>",7
2090,2018,"<p><em>Neurachne alopecuroidea</em> is a common perennial grass species occurring over a wide climatic range in the south-west of Western Australia. It is an ideal species for investigation of the impacts of a warming and drying climate on plant regeneration due to it's widespread occurrence. Variation in temperature and rainfall conditions experienced by populations across the species geographic range make it possible to detect differences in potential climate change responses and relate these to adaption to local climate. This project aims to address a knowledge gap in seed germination biology for this widespread but potentially ecologically important species.&nbsp;</p>

2347,2018,"<p>Orchid seeds are usually desiccation tolerant but recent research has indicated that their storage life is compromised by premature loss of viability under standard storage conditions and even following cryostorage. This study investigated why orchid seeds behave in this manner.</p>
<p>Firstly, artificial seed aging experiments were carried out at high temperature and humidity to simulate natural aging albeit in much shorter time frames, to provide estimates of seed longevity between the species&nbsp;<em>Caladenia latifolia</em> and <em>Microtis media</em>. Results indicate a significant drop in seed viability and germinability at 40<sup>o</sup>C compared to 35<sup>o</sup>C (at the same relative humidity); however, this is more pronounced in <em>C</em>.<em> latifolia</em> seeds which suggests that <em>M. media</em> seeds possess the potential for greater intrinsic longevity in storage compared to <em>C. latifolia</em>. Further experimentation is needed to verify these preliminary results and to ascertain whether differences in storage longevity exist between other orchid species. Secondly, the storage compounds of orchid seeds were analysed to determine what types of compounds are present in orchid seeds. Storage compounds such as sugars help to stabilise seed tissues during drying and storage, hence understanding the types and relative amounts of storage compounds will enhance our knowledge of orchid seed chemistry and potentially provide the means for overcoming short lived storage behaviour in orchid seeds.</p>",7
2099,2018,"<p>There has been a significant amount of research conducted in northern Australia regarding fire regimes and their effect on savanna systems. However, the fire ecology of tree hollows has not been studied in northern Australia. It has been suggested that the drivers of tree hollow development and retention will be different to that known from studies in southern Australia, as savanna systems experience different fire regimes and are subjected to additional processes such as cyclone events and termite activity. Tree hollows are an important ecological resource for around 40% of vertebrates in the Top End including mammals, reptiles, and birds. Developing optimal strategies for managing fire for arboreal mammals and thresholds of hollow abundance mediated by fire frequency and intensity will be a major advance in our understanding of Australian forest ecology and conservation in northern Australia.</p>
<p>Current research activities in this second year of the study include calibrated ground-based observations of vegetation structure and tree hollow abundance and radio tracking arboreal mammals to document hollow usage&nbsp;on the Tiwi Islands. Research has also focused on analysing tree hollow distribution data from the Northern Territory. This work has revealed that aside from rainfall, soil depth and tree size, tree hollow abundance is driven by disturbance including fire regime, cyclones and termites. High frequency late dry season fires can result in reduced hollow abundance</p>",7

Levels of genetic variation and its spatial structure, mating system parameters and patterns of pollen dispersal in&nbsp;<em>S. longissima</em> were examined. A survey of the population was undertaken with 221 of 947 adults, and 106 seeds collected from 14 maternal plants, genotyped using 14 microsatellite markers. The resulting genetic data were used to obtain measures of genetic diversity, generate mating system parameters and assign paternity.</p>
<p>Allelic richness and levels of expected heterozygosity were higher than predicted and reflect high levels of genetic diversity in <em>S. longissima</em>. Outcrossing rate was moderate at 66% and was consistent with values reported for other insect pollinated Australian plants. Extensive inbreeding was found, in both selfing and bi-parental inbreeding. Restricted pollen dispersal was evident, with 95% of matings occurring over a distance of 7 m or less and a mean pollen dispersal distance of 3.65 m. Currently, the population appears genetically healthy, with higher than expected levels of diversity and no evidence for inbreeding depression.

<p>Following a review of the diet of the captive-breeding colony of western swamp tortoises, a second manufactured diet based on white-fleshed fish was developed to address concerns about low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the 'traditional' red meat diet. For four years approximately half the tortoises in the colony have been maintained on the original red-meat based diet and half on the white-fleshed fish diet. The project will determine whether there are any significant differences between the diets in hatchling and juvenile growth rates, weight loss associated with aestivation and female reproductive output (as determined by clutch size, egg mass and hatchling mass). Data collation has been largely completed and data analysis is in progress.</p>",7

2776,2020,"<p>A common method for sampling shallow water reef fish populations is Underwater Visual Census (UVC), where a diver collects information on the abundance, composition and length of fishes within a known sample unit. Major limitations with UVC techniques are inter-observer variability&nbsp;and a lack of accuracy and precision with length and distance estimates. Diver operated underwater stereo-video (stereo-DOV) was developed to overcome these challenges.&nbsp;While stereo-DOV overcomes some of the biases associated with UVC, this method still relies on divers. Occupational safety limits associated with SCUBA diving means that many marine habitats cannot be sampled in this way. Due to such constraints, research has focused on the development of fishery independent sampling techniques that do not rely on the use of SCUBA. One alternative is Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs), which&nbsp;can operate for extended periods of time and at depths beyond 2,500m. Recently, micro ROVs have become increasingly available as a cost-effective sampling tool. By equipping a micro ROV with a lightweight stereo-video system, it is now possible to survey fish assemblages using UVC sampling methods. This project aims to compare the data collected with a micro ROV equipped with a stereo video system to those collected by a SCUBA diver as well as compare and contrast cost efficiencies of each method for monitoring finfish.&nbsp;</p>

2499,2019,"<p>Pollinator services underpin the function and sustainability of most terrestrial ecosystems. Optimal foraging theory predicts that the majority of pollen dispersed by animals will be among the nearest neighbours. However, pollen carryover, and differences in the movement behaviour between vertebrates and invertebrate pollinators, will affect paternity in natural plant populations. The South West Australian Floristic Region has the highest incidence of vertebrate pollination worldwide. Recent studies suggest that almost near random mating may occur in populations of plants pollinated by highly mobile nectar feeding bird species. This research project aims to address the consequences of bird pollination on mating, spatial genetic structure, and fitness in kangaroo paws (<em>Anigozanthos manglesii</em>).</p>
<p>A combination of pollinator observations, exclusion experiments and molecular analysis for paternity assignment have been used to track pollinator behaviour and pollen dispersal within populations of <em>Anigozanthos manglesii</em>. Controlled hand pollinations showed that selfing and nearest neighbour mating, results in severe inbreeding depression and there is a decline in reproductive success with increasing mate distance. These results suggest an optimal outcrossing distance among near (but not nearest) neighbours in natural populations. Paternal diversity and pollen dispersal following bird-pollination is 10x greater than that following pollination by insects. Introduced honeybees are frequent visitors to flowers but ineffective pollinators, and therefore native nectar-feeding birds (honeyeaters) are critical for effective pollination of <em>A. manglesii.</em>&nbsp;</p>",8

<p>Initial methods for location of numbats have been trialled including: 1) the use of a detection dog to assist with locating numbats for capture and collaring; and 2) a pilot study to assess the viability of obtaining trace DNA from numbat scats for individual identification. Pilot studies for the above methods were unsuccessful. Results showed that a detection dog was unable to adequately track numbats to bolt holes or burrows. Trace DNA of sufficient quantity and quality was found only on scat samples from Perth Zoo that had not been exposed (freshly deposited) and all scat samples from wild animals (including fresh scats) failed to amplify.</p>

2513,2019,"<p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is a threatened species listed as Critically Endangered. The species occurs in only two natural populations at very low numbers. Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught tortoises is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Following a review of the diet of the captive-breeding colony of western swamp tortoises, a second manufactured diet based on white-fleshed fish was developed to address concerns about low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the 'traditional' red meat diet. For four years approximately half the tortoises in the colony have been maintained on the original red-meat based diet and half on the white-fleshed fish diet. The project will determine whether there are any significant differences between the diets in hatchling and juvenile growth rates, weight loss associated with aestivation and female reproductive output (as determined by clutch size, egg mass and hatchling mass).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data collation and vetting has been completed and data analysis has commenced. Chemical analysis of the two diet formats has been undertaken through the ChemCentre and another external provider for the analyses of vitamin content of the two diets. Preliminary results indicate that there is no significant difference in the growth rate of adult tortoises on the two diets. Similarly, there is no significant difference in each of the year cohorts, hatchling (age 0) to age 4, between the two diets. Analyses of the effect of diet on reproductive performance of the breeding females is yet to occur.</p>",8
2530,2019,"<p>This project examined the interactions between fire, fuels and seed biology to assess how seeds survive through fire in <em>Banksia</em> woodlands. In fire-prone ecosystems, recruitment from seeds following fire is prolific and provides a pathway for populations to expand into new niches to persist through fire. For many species, recruitment from seed is their only means of population recovery following fire events, so seed survival through fire is vital in order to maximise post-fire recruitment. This project aimed to measure spatially diverse temperatures within soil during fire, examine lethal tolerances of seeds to elevated temperatures associated with fire, establish interactions between lethal tolerances and emergence behaviour and predict weather conditions that may decrease seeds ability to survive fire events.</p>
<p>A new method for measuring soil temperatures during fire that uses distributed temperature sensing within optic fibre was developed. The relationship between seed moisture and lethal thresholds of seeds (seeds high in moisture content have a reduced tolerance to high temperatures) have been established. The relationships between temperature penetration into soils and fuel loads, and the depth from which seeds are able to emerge from soils and their lethal temperatures have been determined.</p>",8
2562,2019,"<p>Artificial light influences the orientation of hatchling flatback turtles and is a major pressure affecting this species in Western Australia. This project will investigate the extent of this influence under different light regimes and environmental cues and will quantify the impacts of light on hatchling turtles in nearshore waters. The aims of this project are to: (1) determine if flatback turtle hatchlings are attracted to different types of light when in the water and for how long using acoustic telemetry, whilst concurrently looking at what natural cues (e.g. currents and waves) they may be using to initially move offshore; (2) determine if flatback turtle hatchlings use wave cues to move offshore, and explore the relationship between light cues and wave cues in a wave tank for both flatback and green turtle hatchlings; and (3) examine the relationship between distance from light source and hatchling attraction, as well as what effect lingering around light sources on permanent light-emitting structures has on the predation rates of flatback hatchlings.</p>
<p>Field experiments used acoustic tracking to follow hatchlings through the nearshore zone at Thevenard Island with and without the influence of artificial light and with and without the influence of a jetty structure. Results showed that the nearshore transit of turtles was highly influenced by artificial light that increased the transit time of hatchlings, changed their direction and retained hatchlings in the light spill.

2492,2019,"<p>Using direct seeding machinery to sow native seeds for restoration can be challenging as many seeds possess complex morphological features that impede controlled and reliable flow through the machinery. The increasing requirement to deliver biodiverse seed mixes to a variety of landscapes motivates continued improvement in direct seeder design. This project aims to analyse current seed distribution methods and to design, construct, and test new or modified seeders for use in mine site rehabilitation. The primary objectives include the capability for controlling seed depth and spacing, sowing at rates applicable to large-scale rehabilitation, and seeding over diverse landforms including rocky and sloping land.</p>
<p>A field trial was completed to test the influence of rock content on seedling emergence. Seeds of&nbsp;<em>Triodia pungens&nbsp;</em>were sown at different depths within three soil profiles sieved to rock diameters of &lt;2mm, &lt;25mm, and un-sieved soil. Rock content did not hinder the ability of seeds to emerge when sown to shallow depths; however, when sown deeper than 15 mm, increasing rock content decreased emergence. Although rock content contributed to a reduction in emergence at depths below 15 mm, sowing depth remained the primary factor controlling emergence across the soil profiles.&nbsp;A range of direct seeding machinery components are now being evaluated in the field for their capacity to place seeds in the upper 10 mm of these rock soil profiles. These components include double disc opener type assemblies used as pasture drills in the agriculture industry, as well as knife point tynes, and more novel designs which aim to splay the soil fraction over the seeds, thereby creating a suitable seed bed.</p>",8

A total of 20 fish species were found across three habitats (seagrass, macroalgae and sand) but did not differ significantly in richness or density between habitats. Results suggest that <em>H. ovalis</em> provides little habitat or direct food resource for fishes, but does contribute to the production of invertebrates. Drift algae did not appear to enhance or impact fish communities or provide a major food resource to fish, but did contribute to invertebrate production. Seagrass and algal wrack did not appear to be beneficial to invertebrate or fish assemblages. However the decomposition pathway of this material and its contribution to the detrital food web is not known at this time.</p>",8
2815,2020,"<p>The jarrah (<em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>) and karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>) forests of south-west Western Australia are important sources of timber, wildlife habitat and water. However, as climate changes, issues of forest productivity, tree health and mortality, and water yield need to be addressed. Individual-based modelling (IBM) is an ecological modelling approach that represents individuals within populations or communities, and the interactions between them, with a relatively high level of detail and complexity. This study aims to develop an IBM of tree growth in water limited environments, to parameterise the model for jarrah and karri and to predict the impact of tree thinning on timber production, tree health and mortality and water yield using time series data collected from 1965 and 1992, respectively.</p>
<p>For both species, thinning has a positive impact on growth with stand growth optimised at intermediate densities (10-20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) over multi-decadal time periods, consistent with findings from previous studies. Thinning also influences allometry of stem diameter with height, ratio of height and diameter, crown width and bark thickness. Linear IBM for diameter growth prediction have been developed for jarrah and karri that predict stem diameter growth based on initial diameter, initial height, size and distance of the nearest neighbours using competition indices. Four manuscripts have been prepared for publication, and a further manuscript reporting growth response of marri to thinning is undergoing internal review.</p>",9

This project will focus on the habitat requirements of epinepheline serranids at Ningaloo Marine Park, exploring mechanisms that influence their distribution, abundance and productivity. The project will examine fish within two prominent habitat types at Ningaloo, macroalgae and corals, that also represent extremes of the current regime shift paradigm on tropical reefs.</p>

Early results indicated suitable food availability as a key component. The aims are to 1) develop novel environmental DNA methods to understand diet in new habitats; 2) document foraging behaviour in relation to water temperatures and prey availability; 3) link metabolic processes and food intake to predict long-term growth rates and reproduction in new environments. This will provide greater certainty on whether southern wetlands can provide viable habitat for this critically endangered species in the near future.</p>

Current methods to determine condition are difficult to undertake over large areas and are time consuming. This research project aims to determine if near-surface remote sensing measurements (particularly hyperspectral sensing and thermography) can reliably quantify plant drought stress condition in a biodiverse plant community. Quantitative criteria will be proposed to evaluate restoration success by defining a fast, accurate and easy to perform methodology, and potentially establishing the foundation for scaling up to more remote imaging platforms that allow monitoring of larger areas in shorter periods of time.</p>
<p>Data analysis from a controlled drought glasshouse experiment is showing that certain spectral reflectance regions located in the near infra-red and short-wave infrared part of the spectrum (specifically water absorption features as well as optimised vegetation indices) have the capacity to accurately predict relevant physiological variables such as leaf water potential in several common species of a <em>Banksia</em> woodland, both at the leaf and plant scales. Thermography data analysis, although at an early stage, is showing a general solid relationship between leaf temperature and stomatal conductance, although it is variable across species.

Thirty-one percent of the world&rsquo;s sharks and rays are threatened with extinction and declines have led to an increased need for conservation and sustainable&nbsp;management.

2551,2019,"<p>Anthropogenic loss and fragmentation of natural habitats has been increasing during the last 60 years and is now at unprecedented levels, making land use change one of the most important drivers affecting biodiversity. <em>Conospermum undulatum</em> is endemic to southwest Western Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. Significant reductions in population size, connectivity, area and floral display of remnant patches are likely to constrain the reproduction of this species by altered plant-pollinator interactions and expression of inbreeding depression because of reduced gene flow between unrelated individuals. This project will investigate the reproductive biology and genetic diversity in the species to inform recovery actions to enhance the future persistence of <em>C. undulatum </em>by means of an improved understanding of factors that constrain both its reproduction and its adaptation ability over long-term.</p>
<p>Reproductive data on fruit and seed production, and seedling germination and mortality, was collected from 210 individuals in 12 populations. Fruit production was affected only by the population&rsquo;s floral display, i.e. its potential to attract pollinators, whereas seed production was significantly related to population size, connectivity and floral display. These results identified these three variables as those that best explain the reproductive trend of <em>C. undulatum</em>, and indicate that both pollen limitation and genetic factors prevent the development of the embryo. Quantification of the amount of pollen limitation showed that hand cross-pollination produced a ten-fold increase in seed production compared to natural pollination. Also, using pollen sourced from different populations showed that small populations are producing approximately&nbsp;50% less seeds than they are able to produce via inter-population cross-breeding due to the combined effects of pollen limitation and reduction in compatible mate availability. These results suggest that habitat fragmentation may result in patches that are too small and isolated to be attractive for pollinators and to allow a long-term population viability based on reproduction by seed.</p>",8

2478,2019,"<p>The most common method for sampling shallow water reef fish populations is Underwater Visual Census (UVC), where a SCUBA diver or snorkeler collects information on the abundance, composition and length of fishes within a known sample unit. One of the major limitations with UVC techniques is inter-observer variability&nbsp;and a lack of accuracy and precision with length and distance estimates. Underwater stereo-video operated by a SCUBA diver (stereo-DOVs) were developed to overcome these challenges.&nbsp;While stereo-DOVs overcome some of the biases associated with UVC, they still rely on a SCUBA diver to operate them. In Australia, occupational health and safety&nbsp;guidelines mean that SCUBA divers rarely operate deeper than 20 metres, leaving a vast proportion of the ocean off limit. Due to the safety concerns of these approaches, there has been a focus on the development of fishery independent sampling techniques that do not rely on SCUBA divers. One alternative is Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs), which&nbsp;can operate for extended periods of time and at depths of up to 2,500 m or greater. In recent years micro ROVs have become increasingly available and have decreased dramatically in price making them an affordable sampling tool. By equipping a micro ROV with a lightweight stereo-video system, it is now possible to survey fish assemblages using UVC sampling theories. This project aims to compare the data collected from micro ROVs equipped with a stereo video system to those collected by a SCUBA diver as well as compare and contrast cost efficiencies of each method for monitoring finfish.&nbsp;</p>

These seed enhancement technologies include extruded pellets or seed coatings with either activated carbon or biochar (both ingredients known to adsorb herbicides) and a control where seeds were left untreated (no seed enhancement technology). This field trial will also be used to see how these technologies impact the emergence, growth and survival post summer of <em>J. furcellata&nbsp;</em>across the different management treatment types. Currently emergence data is being collected twice a week until peak emergence is reached, and then monitoring will continue approximately once a fortnight.</p>",8

2569,2019,"<p>Seaweed-dominated habitats occur in tropical reef systems, where they play vital roles in supporting key species and processes. Habitat quality in seaweed patches, measured as canopy height, holdfast density or percentage cover, varies seasonally and can be a major driver of the presence and abundance of key functional and taxonomic fish groups. However, the relative influence of other seascape variables, such as patch shape, size and proximity, remains poorly understood. This project will study seaweed habitats at Ningaloo Marine Park, building on research in the region that has highlighted the importance of seaweed micro-habitat and intra-patch structure by including patch and inter-patch measures. The study will focus on fishes of the family Labridae (wrasses and parrotfishes), which are a diverse group of conspicuous reef fishes that span a wide range of trophic groups, body sizes, social structures, movement patterns and diel ranges. Specifically the project will: (1) establish how within and between patch habitat structure influences reef fish diversity within the Ningaloo lagoon; (2) explore how patch habitat configuration influences fish predator-prey dynamics; and (3) quantify how seaweed-associated fish assemblages respond to acute and unseasonal disturbances in patch-habitat condition.</p>
<p>Analysis of fish dynamics demonstrates that both seascape measures of connectivity among habitats and within patch measures of canopy structure are important predictors of fish diversity and should be considered in conservation planning. Study of the effects of experimentally reduced macroalgal canopy height on fish assemblages at Ningaloo found that canopy height and associated fish assemblages typically returned to post disturbance levels within two years, though canopies dominated by the genus <em>Sargassopsis</em> had not fully recovered and abundance of herbivorous fish on experimental meadows was lower than it was before the experiment.</p>",8
2556,2019,"<p>There has been a significant amount of research conducted in northern Australia regarding fire regimes and their effect on savanna systems. However, the fire ecology of tree hollows has not been studied in northern Australia. It has been suggested that the drivers of tree hollow development and retention will be different to that known from studies in southern Australia, as savanna systems experience different fire regimes and are subjected to additional processes such as cyclone events and termite activity. Tree hollows are an important ecological resource for around 40% of vertebrates in the Top End including mammals, reptiles and birds. Developing optimal strategies for managing fire for arboreal mammals and thresholds of hollow abundance mediated by fire frequency and intensity will be a major advance in our understanding of Australian forest ecology and conservation in northern Australia.</p>
<p>Analysis has shown that termite activity in tropical savanna trees not only forms hollows, but also blocks them. This is an important potential source of error in ground-based estimates or counts of tree hollows to gauge habitat value for threatened arboreal mammals which often rely on hollows for nests and shelter. Camera traps set on nest boxes and tree hollows have revealed complex patterns of hollow use over time by different individuals, different species and also arboreal predators including tree goannas, tree snakes and pythons. Analysis of tree hollow distribution data from the Northern Territory has revealed that aside from rainfall, soil depth and tree size, tree hollow abundance is mainly driven by disturbance regimes including fire, cyclones and termite activity. Frequent late dry season fires can result in reduced hollow abundance, particularly of trees with large hollows, which are the most used hollows by arboreal mammals.</p>",8

3485,2023,"<p>Aerial survey is a standard technique used in wildlife management to estimate population abundance and detect trends.&nbsp; It is particularly useful for species with&nbsp;large ranges and broad distribution patterns, such as marine mammals, as the technique allows relatively large areas to be covered over short periods of time. While aerial surveys are typically designed for specific target species, additional species are often recorded as surveys are generally infrequent due to expense and logistical constraints. Analyses to estimate abundance of non-target species recorded during surveys can have limitations as information recorded for these species may be constrained or incomplete. In this study, analysis of aerial survey data collected in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, will be extended beyond the target species (dolphins) and applied to humpback whale (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) abundance estimation. While the survey was designed for distance sampling abundance estimation of dolphins, a strip transect approach was taken for humpback whales, and a maximum strip width was not defined. This study will evaluate various strip width estimates derived from the detection functions of comparable cues and a field based trial. &nbsp;An absolute abundance estimate for humpback whales will be calculated using strip-transect based methods, with corrections for availability and perception bias. The methods used here will be evaluated through comparison of these estimates with those derived from photographs taken during the survey, which have a known strip width. The relative density distribution of the species within the area will also be mapped and evaluated. The results of this study will update current knowledge on the abundance and distribution of key marine mammals with a focus on humpback whales in Exmouth Gulf, to inform ongoing monitoring and management of this &lsquo;conservation dependant' population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aerial imagery has been compiled and reviewed to address the biases inherent in aerial survey data. This has included conducting an additional single day of aerial survey to detertmine detection function and strip width for the analysis. The results are being written up.</p>",12

This project will focus on the habitat requirements of epinepheline serranids at Ningaloo, exploring mechanisms that influence their distribution, abundance and productivity. The project will examine fish within two habitat types, macroalgae and corals, representing extremes of the current regime shift paradigm on tropical reefs.</p>

3250,2022,"<p>The western grasswren (<em>Amytornis textilis</em>) is restricted to Shark Bay in Western Australia and is listed as Priority Four. The species formerly occurred on Dirk Hartog Island but became extinct due to non-native herbivores and feral cats. The Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological Restoration Project seeks to reintroduce a suite of locally extinct fauna to the island, including the grasswren. However, the western grasswren is probably the most poorly studied of all these species and little is known about its genetics or behaviour. The aim of this project is to investigate the population genetics and behavioural ecology of this cryptic bird species. This will require intensive studies of colour-banded birds, as well as obtaining tissue samples from a sufficient number of birds to undertake robust genetic analyses. This work will culminate in the development of a population viability analysis which will directly inform the translocation strategy for Dirk Hartog Island.</p>
<p>A final year of fieldwork was undertaken in spring of 2021 at Hamelin Station Reserve to collect breeding data, collect blood samples and gather further audio data. Blood samples were sequenced and a new SNP dataset was created which contains all western grasswren blood samples collected between 2019 to 2021. The breeding and SNP data was integrated into a population viability analysis, which aims to provide guidance on the translocation of western grasswren from mainland Shark Bay to Dirk Hartog Island. Currently, a manuscript detailing the population genetics of the western grasswren is in review in Ibis, and the manuscript detailing the breeding biology and social organisation of the western grasswren is in review in <em>Emu &ndash; Austral Ornithology</em>.

As a consequence, new fish resources are being sort in deeper waters. The project aims to assess the effect of the Galapagos Marine Reserve, changes in fisher effort and environment on fish assemblages in the Galapagos. The results of conservation approaches in the Galapagos can be compared and contrasted to Western Australia to inform and potentially improve on the monitoring and conservation of marine fishes in both locations.</p>

<p>First, this project modelled the associations between red fox and feral cat occurrence and fox baiting intensity, prey abundance and rainfall. Second, this project used structural equation modelling to identify primary productivity and habitat extent as key drivers of historical population change for woylie, chuditch, koomal and quenda populations, and rainfall declines and severe fire as potential drivers of future population declines. Lastly, the project used multi-species abundance modelling and optimisation analyses to demonstrate how fire and red fox management strategies might be optimised to maximise the abundance of species of conservation concern in the Upper Warren. The outcomes of this project demonstrate that managers need to consider the complexity of ecosystems and their local context when designing conservation interventions, and this must be done in an adaptive framework so that management can be continuously improved.</p>",12
2558,2019,"<p>Seasonal claypans on the Swan Coastal Plain are predicted to become less suitable for the endangered western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) in coming decades as rainfall declines further. One response to this threat is to seek alternative habitats in higher rainfall areas of the south coast. A trial translocation into two wetlands (near Northcliffe and east of Augusta) was undertaken in 2016. This project aimed to compare invertebrate food resources between these sites and a wetland on the Swan Coastal Plain (Moore River Nature Reserve) that currently supports a translocated population. Western swamp tortoise gut contents were also obtained and the identity and biomass of food items calculated.</p>
<p>Invertebrate biomass did not differ between the three wetlands, but the southern sites had lower diversity. Greater numbers of prey, from a wider range of groups, were consumed at Moore River than at the other sites, possibly reflecting the warmer conditions there (which promotes feeding). The south coast sites support sufficient food resources and may be suitable as translocation sites as more northern wetlands become drier and the southern sites warmer. Two endangered fish species were present in the southern sites and, while neither were consumed by the tortoises, food web effects on fish prey would need to be considered.</p>",8

Following a review of the diet of the captive-breeding colony of western swamp tortoises, a second manufactured diet based on white-fleshed fish was developed to address concerns about low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the 'traditional' red meat diet. For four years, approximately half the tortoises in the colony have been maintained on the original red-meat based diet and half on the white-fleshed fish diet.

Following a review of the diet of the captive-breeding colony of western swamp tortoises, a second manufactured diet based on white-fleshed fish was developed to address concerns about low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the 'traditional' red meat diet. For four years, approximately half the tortoises in the colony have been maintained on the original red-meat based diet and half on the white-fleshed fish diet. The project will determine whether there are any significant differences between the diets in hatchling and juvenile growth rates, weight loss associated with aestivation and female reproductive output (as determined by clutch size, egg mass and hatchling mass).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analyses of the data on the growth rate of adult tortoises and each of the annual cohorts from hatchling to age 4 indicates that there was no significant difference due to diet. Analyses of the effect of diet on reproductive performance of the breeding females is under way and writing of the thesis has commenced.</p>",9
2498,2019,"<p>This research aims to provide a comprehensive test of the influence of climatic and edaphic variation on the performance of genotypes from multiple provenances, to identify best-practice seed sourcing for restoration. Although many strategies for seed sourcing have been proposed, there are few empirical tests of different strategies. In this project, multiple genetic provenances of <em>Banksia menziesii</em>, a restoration priority plant species on the Swan Coastal Plain, will be tested in post-mining rehabilitation field sites, as well as glasshouse growth trials where environmental parameters will be modified. In addition, physical, chemical and biological properties of soils from these multiple source sites will be assessed and compared to the performance of seeds sourced from these sites.</p>
<p>Field trials have been completed and preliminary results show no significant provenance effect on seedling survival based on pairwise comparisons. However, in three out of four field trials, seedling survival of local provenances was above the overall average after six months. Further analysis of the glasshouse experiment is in progress.

This project aimed to identify possible causes, including secondary poisoning from anticoagulant rodenticides, across a series of landscapes impacted differently by human activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Results of the project show that artificial nest box supplementation does not appear to affect boobook occupancy in fragmented habitats in south-western Australia. Most risk factors previously implicated in increased risk of <em>Toxoplasma</em> infection did not show significant correlations with observed seropositivity in boobooks. However, the season in which the sample was collected did correlate significantly with seropositivity. Boobooks in Western Australia show weak spatial genetic structuring and no evidence of genetic erosion associated with inbreeding in heavily fragmented landscapes, probably a consequence of the dispersal capacity of boobook offspring and their ability as habitat and dietary generalists to make use of highly altered landscapes.</p>",8

<p>Camera traps are useful for detecting feral cats, but questions remain over the use of these devices for large-scale and long-term monitoring. This project is looking to individually identify feral cats from images obtained during a four-year systematic camera trap monitoring program in the Pilbara. If feral cats are recognisable from their coat patterns, this would allow for spatially explicit capture-recapture methods to be used to estimate cat densities, permitting improved assessment of control programs.</p>
<p>Over the study, 3,568 camera trap images of feral cats were captured representing 299 cat visits. At least 142 individuals have been identified from their markings; 88 at the unbaited site and 54 at the baited site. More individuals were recaptured in the unbaited treatment (36 cf. 17 cats in baited cell). Few cats were detected both before and after a baiting episode, although some adults survived at least one baiting operation.</p>

However, as climate changes, issues of forest productivity, tree health and mortality, and water yield need to be addressed. Individual-based modelling (IBM) is an ecological modelling approach that represents individuals within populations or communities, and the interactions between them, with a relatively high level of detail and complexity. This study aims to develop an IBM of tree growth in water limited environments, to parameterise the model for jarrah and karri and to predict the impact of tree thinning on timber production, tree health and mortality and water yield using time series data collected from 1965 and 1992, respectively.</p>

2515,2019,"<p>The tufted capuchin (<em>Sapagus</em> apella) is a new world monkey native to the Amazon rainforest ranging inland from the north-eastern coast of South America, across to eastern Columbia. Perth Zoo houses five tufted capuchins, one of whom, a mature male, was introduced approximately twelve months ago, to provide a mate for a female who had started undergoing oestrus. This resulted in a successful pregnancy. The aim of the project was firstly to record the behaviour profiles and interactions of each animal, to determine whether the male had been integrated into the resident troop or not. The secondary aim was to evaluate the adequacy of the captive environment.</p>
<p>The project involved filming the monkeys individually by two observers over six weeks, which was then edited into an hour of footage per individual, containing the most representative of their activities. Overall, the results revealed a pattern of behaviour very similar to that obtained from studies in the wild and captivity, with most time devoted to movement, foraging, feeding and resting, though reduced a little, as is typical of captive studies. There were very low levels of inter-animal aggression. There was very little or no interaction and social exchange between the introduced male and the resident colony, apart from an exchange of aggression displayed on one occasion from the female. There was also very little social contact between the mated animals, in contrast to that shown by the resident dominant pair. We conclude that the introduced male is still a separate entity within the enclosure, and his general behaviours are different in many respects from those shown by the others capuchins.</p>",8

Rehabilitation and translocation are important conservation tools that allow rescued captive-held gibbons to be released into wild populations. However, this is a relatively new conservation strategy for gibbons and there are few published data on successful rehabilitation and release conditions. Appropriate captive management strategies are crucial to the success of the rehabilitation programs, for the management of animals during rehabilitation and for the management of captive-bred animals that can contribute to wild populations.

<p>A review of gibbon social dynamics, conservation status and conservation strategies was undertaken with a focus on rescue and rehabilitation programs in hylobatids and particularly Javan gibbons. Observation and analysis of within-group social dynamics and alternative group compositions in Javan gibbon was undertaken in two different contexts: social dynamics in a non-traditional grouping of captive Javan gibbons at Perth Zoo focusing on a family group that lacked an adult male and investigated sibling and mother-offspring relationships; and two non-traditional pairs of Javan gibbons at Aspinall Foundation&rsquo;s Javan Primate Rehabilitation Centre. These observed pairs were pairings of unusual and 'alternative' bonds. Both settings used observational data on affiliative and agonistic behavioural exchanges, as well as proximity interactions, as measures of gibbon pair-bonds and relationships. Observations were made of the social dynamics and interactions in these alternative groups that did not fit with traditional ideas of gibbon social systems. This study contributed to the growing literature on the flexibility of gibbon social dynamics by investigating gibbon social dynamics with an emphasis on 'beyond the pair-bond' behaviour.

Habitat categories consisted of areas with different timber harvest- and fire histories, fox baiting intensities and forest types (Wandoo and Jarrah). During four repeat surveys, more than 800 numbat scats were found at 65/78 sites, resulting in a na&iuml;ve occupancy rate of 83%. Preliminary results show that numbats appear to be generalists with no clear preference for any key habitat. Fieldwork for this project has been completed, and several papers are being prepared for publication.</p>",8
2509,2019,"<p>Salt lakes in Western Australia are threatened by climate change, secondary salinity and mining, with consequences for the unique but poorly understood fauna that they support, including the endemic gastropod genus&nbsp;<em>Coxiella&nbsp;</em>which appears to have greatest diversity in south-west of Western Australia. The consequences of these threats to <em>Coxiella </em>is currently unclear as specimens cannot be confidently identified due to the existing insufficient taxonomy.</p>
<p>The principal aim of this project is to resolve the taxonomy of <em>Coxiella </em>to provide a sound platform for future work on this taxon. The project will also determine the salinity tolerances and desiccation resistance of different species and assess how past climate change has influenced the evolutionary histories of selected species. This means it will be possible to assess the vulnerability of <em>Coxiella</em> species to environmental change and to predict the impact of future changes. This project follows a DBCA summer scholarship project in 2018-19 that aimed to determine if DNA extracted from dead shells could be used for species identification. Since live&nbsp;<em>Coxiella</em>&nbsp;are only collectable for short periods, using their dead shells to determine what species were present would increase the scope of future studies investigating this taxon. This study extracted high molecular weight DNA from shells but the identity of the DNA was not verified due to issues encountered with amplification. The lack of successful amplification was attributed to inappropriate primer design and the presence of PCR inhibitors that could not be resolved using the methodologies attempted.</p>",8

Although a definitive diagnosis has not been obtained, the hypothesized etiology is an organophosphate-induced delayed-onset neuropathy. The syndrome may indicate that interaction between the cockatoos and inland agricultural practices are affecting this migratory species in ways that are, so far, poorly understood. The syndrome is confined to Carnaby&rsquo;s cockatoos and affects cockatoos regardless of gender or age, and is typically seen in the austral summer and autumn with a peak in presentations in February. The reason for the sudden emergence of the cockatoo hindlimb paralysis syndrome is unknown. This study aims to characterise and investigate the cause of Cockatoo Hindlimb Paralysis Syndrome (CHiPS) in Western Australian black cockatoos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To date, necropsies have been performed on 17 CHiPS case animals and 14 control animals. No significant findings have been demonstrated with gross examination and histopathology; including serial sectioning of the brain, spinal cord, sciatic nerves, brachial plexus and multiple skeletal muscle bodies.&nbsp;The acetylcholine esterase assays that investigate acute organophosphate toxicosis have shown no significant findings. Initial results from an assay used to investigate delayed organophosphate neuropathy (NTE) in brain tissue has demonstrated a significant difference between CHiPS cases and control birds. The median brain NTE activity for control birds was 0.1172 mU/g of brain tissue compared to the median brain NTE activity of 0.0226 mU/g of brain tissue in CHiPS cases. Current work is focussed on validation of this assay (ensuring that the results are accurate and reproducible) and production of a reference interval for NTE in the brains of Carnaby&rsquo;s black cockatoos.</p>",9
3087,2021,"<p>Arboreal nest box/camera studies suggest that the greatest benefit of using nest boxes in augmenting nesting sites is gained in intermediate savanna/forest habitats where large tree and hollow density is medium. Arboreal species overlap in their hollow and tree use; however the brush tailed rabbit rat build their dens closer to the ground in dead trees and hollow logs, and forages at ground level. This makes it more susceptible to terrestrial threatening processes (fire, feral cats, cattle and buffalo) compared to larger, more arboreal species including black footed tree rat, brush tailed possum and savanna gliders. Despite the importance of arboreal habitat features like hollows, the strongest explanatory variables for presence of threatened arboreal mammals were terrestrial factors including fire regimes, presence of cats, shrub density and vegetation damage by cattle and water buffalo.</p>

2794,2020,"<p>Pollinator services underpin the function and sustainability of most terrestrial ecosystems. Optimal foraging theory predicts that the majority of pollen dispersed by animals will be among the nearest neighbours. However, pollen carryover, and differences in the movement behaviour between vertebrates and invertebrate pollinators, will affect paternity in natural plant populations. The South West Australian Floristic Region has the highest incidence of vertebrate pollination worldwide. Recent studies suggest that almost near random mating may occur in populations of plants pollinated by highly mobile nectar feeding bird species. This research project aims to address the consequences of bird pollination on mating, spatial genetic structure, and fitness in kangaroo paws (<em>Anigozanthos manglesii</em>).</p>
<p>Controlled hand pollinations showed that selfing and nearest neighbour mating results in inbreeding depression and a decline in reproductive success with increasing mate distance. These results suggest an optimal outcrossing distance among near neighbours in natural populations. Paternal diversity and pollen dispersal following bird-pollination was 10 times greater than that following pollination by insects. Introduced honeybees are frequent visitors to flowers but ineffective pollinators, and therefore native nectar-feeding birds are critical for effective pollination of <em>A. manglesii.</em>&nbsp;Three papers have been published in <em>Applications in Plant Sciences</em>, <em>Annals of Botany</em> and <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>.</p>",9

<p>Geophysical and in situ measurements were conducted before, during and after two rainfall events. Pore-water sampling showed hyporheic exchange occurred at a sandy site to a depth of 30 cm and was insignificant at a site with higher clay contents. Geophysics was able to image the spatial distribution of sediments; however, the observed hyporheic zone changes in resistivity were too weak to be resolved by ERT. The results suggest that resistivity may be better suited to characterising the spatial distribution of sediment properties that are conducive to hyporheic exchange.</p>",9

Sequencing nuclear data from gymnosperms is often challenging due to their complex genomes and unfortunately, the SNP data exhibited low resolution; nevertheless, it showed a general pattern of low genetic differentiation amongst populations across the species' main distribution in the southern Jarrah forests, in contrast to the more differentiated disjunct populations located in the Swan region. This geographic pattern was consistent with that shown in the results from the chloroplast genome. In addition, the chloroplast data showed high levels of haplotype diversity within and among populations and no phylogeographic structure, indicating historically large population sizes and high gene flow, with no indication of contraction to refugia through historical climate fluctuations.&nbsp;</p>",12

3035,2021,"<p><em>Syzygium paniculatum</em> and <em>Syzygium australe</em> are two rainforest species with recalcitrant seeds that are not storable by seed banking, with <em>S. paniculatum</em> currently threatened in its native habitat. The objective of this project is to develop a viable cryopreservation protocol for these species. Tissue cultured shoots offer an alternative explant source for cryopreservation and ex situ conservation of these and other threatened recalcitrant-seeded Australian species. Syzygium species have a strong tolerance to long incubation times in cryoprotective agents (CPAs) but exhibit a complete lack of survival following liquid nitrogen (LN) exposure, which could indicate that post-cryogenic failure is primarily due to either insufficient vitrification promotion and/or insufficient suppression of ice formation. This study on Syzygium cryopreservation is focussed on investigations using thermo-analytical assessments (differential scanning calorimetry) to measure the extent of ice formation in shoot tissues, permitting the differentiation between cell death by actual ice damage or other stress factors such as CPA toxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage.</p>

This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap and identify the movement and behaviour of northern quolls living in mining landscapes.</p>
<p>Northern quolls living in the mining landscape situated their broad movement ranges in areas with high proportions of remnant rocky habitat and used all other habitats in proportion to their availability, including mining habitats. On a fine scale, quolls avoided mining habitats relative to rocky habitat in breeding season but used mining habitats at a similar rate to rocky habitat in non-breeding season. This increased use of mining habitats resulted in an increased energetic cost for quolls, potentially leading to sublethal effects such as decreased body condition. The investigation of animal abundances around mining camps using camera traps is ongoing, with all fieldwork completed and image identification and analyses underway.</p>",12

2798,2020,"<p>Plant physiological condition is a key indicator in the early stages of restoration progress assessment. Current methods to determine condition are difficult to undertake over large areas and are time consuming. This research project aims to determine if near-surface remote sensing measurements (particularly hyperspectral sensing and thermography) can reliably quantify plant drought stress condition in a biodiverse plant community. Quantitative criteria will be proposed to evaluate restoration success by defining a fast, accurate and easy to perform methodology, and potentially establishing the foundation for scaling up to more remote imaging platforms that allow monitoring of larger areas in shorter periods of time.</p>

This is true both at the leaf scale using an internal light source, as well as at plant canopy level using a non-reflective background and natural illumination conditions. Thermography data analysis, although at an early stage, is showing a general solid relationship between leaf temperature and stomatal conductance, although it is variable across species. In a field experiment carried out in a restored <em>Banksia</em> woodland, ecophysiological performance of young plants (3 to 4 years old) of five plant species of different functional types was monitored throughout a natural seasonal cycle, in parallel with hyperspectral reflectance and thermography measures. Water relations and drought stress adapations differed between species, outlining a clear gradient from drought-avoider species to drought-tolerant species. Preliminary analysis of hyperspectral data at the leaf level shows that full and/or partial spectrum analysis through Partial Least Square Regression as well as optimised spectral indices can accurately predict leaf water potential, relative water content and especially leaf water content levels, although to a lesser extent than in our glasshouse experiment. Preliminary results also show prediction models to be not reliable when using canopy level reflectance data, where soil and litter background reflectance interfere with plant tissue reflectance.</span></p>",9
2770,2020,"<p><span style=""margin: 0px;"">Populations of the granivorous Gouldian finch (<em>Erythrura gouldiae</em>) have not recovered from historical population declines prior to the 1980's. It is hypothesised that this lack of recovery is due to a decline in grass seed diversity in response to higher frequency and intensity fires across the landscape, which is forcing Gouldian finches to move longer distances to meet their dietary requirements in a more homogeneous landscape. The project aims to estimate the activity range, habitat use and dispersal for threatened Gouldian finches, and compare this with the more common masked and long tailed finches, to look at reasons for rarity in Gouldians and also to design management options to improve Gouldian finch status. This presents technical challenges due to the small size and high mobility of study animals using automated radio telemetry.</span></p>
<p>This project is in the analysis phase and field work is complete. Novel telemetry techniques delivered over 20 million fixes on 166 individual finches (approximately 50K detections/individual). Redetection rates were 92 percent compared to conventional banding recapture rates of only 1.7 percent. Core areas of finch activity are being analysed, and this information will be used to model key explanatory variables for finch movements across savanna landscapes. Spatial distribution of different grass species and their seeds, fire mosaics and nesting hollow density will be used in models to determine what drives threatened finch movements. Isotopic analysis of finch blood samples has revealed significant niche differentiation between the three finch species and also seasonal variation in diet. Gouldian finches had lower dietary nitrogen than either long tailed or masked finches, supporting the hypothesis that they are specialised granivores, whereas the other species supplement their diet with invertebrates.

2522,2019,"<p>Lumpy jaw is a well-recognised cause of morbidity and mortality in captive macropods (Macropodidae) worldwide. The extent and causes of the disease are largely unknown, although multiple risk factors associated with a captive environment are thought to contribute to the development of clinical disease. Identification of risk factors associated with lumpy jaw would assist with the development of preventive management strategies, potentially reducing mortalities.</p>
<p>A cross-sectional study was undertaken from 2011 to 2015, to determine prevalence and risk factors for this disease through the distribution of a survey to 527 institutions across Australia and Europe; two regions where macropods are popular exhibits. The data were analysed in a retrospective cohort study to&nbsp;examine risk factors for developing the disease and treatments used, and computed tomography was used to examine disease occurrence in wild macropods using skulls from population management culls. The prevalence of lumpy jaw was found to differ between the two regions. A review of 6,178 records for 2,759 macropods housed within eight zoos across, Australia and Europe, found incidence rates and risk of infection differed between geographic regions and individual institutions. Risk of developing lumpy jaw increased with age, particularly for macropods &gt;10 years. Treatment approach varied and prognosis was typically poor with 62.5% mortality for Australian and European regions combined. Lumpy jaw was detected in all captive genera examined, but was absent from the wild populations studied. Geographic region influenced the incidence of lumpy jaw, the risks associated with developing clinical disease, and preferred treatment approach and may assist institutions in providing optimal long-term health management for captive macropods.</p>",8
3076,2021,"<p>Tropical herbivorous fish continue to expand their ranges poleward as seawater temperature increases due to global climate change. Such fish can have significant impacts on temperate reef ecosystems dominated by fleshy macroalgae and interwoven seagrass meadows. This project examines the effects of these fish groups on temperate coastal ecosystems in the mid-west and Perth metropolitan area. Results have shown that tropical herbivorous fish that have settled in temperate coastal ecosystems have modified life-history traits relative to those in tropical waters, benefiting their ability to persist in these locations. They also can potentially increase detritus production in metropolitan coastal waters and fill a novel herbivorous function relative to their temperate counterparts, increasing local consumption of macroalgae. This work greatly assists the ability to predict future changes to WA's temperate marine ecosystems as a result of future climate change effects.</p>

2763,2020,"<p>Salt lakes are an iconic feature of Western Australian semi-arid and arid landscapes, with a flora and fauna that has adapted and diversified within these extreme environments. Several groups appear to be far more diverse in Western Australia than anywhere else in Australia and even globally. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing (especially in the Wheatbelt) and increasingly, by mining on or near the lake bed. One of the most intriguing invertebrate groups is the snail genus <em>Coxiella</em>, which tolerates both periodic drying and high salinities and is the only mollusc occurring in temporarily filled salt lakes. This project focusses on the taxonomy, ecology and evolutionary history of this genus.</p>
<p>A literature review is in preparation that will collate information on the biology of halophilic and halobiontic crustaceans and gastropods of Australian salt lakes.&nbsp;Most of the samples required for the taxonomic component of the project have been collected, including fresh specimens<em>&nbsp;</em>from salt lakes throughout south-west Western Australia and several samples from museums. Sampling for species that occur outside of Western Australia is also being undertaken. Combining these samples will permit a thorough assessment of the current taxonomic framework and is likely to identify new species.</p>",9
3526,2023,"<p>This research aimed to comprehensively test the influence of climatic and edaphic variation on the performance of genotypes from multiple provenances, to identify best-practice seed sourcing for restoration. Although many strategies for seed sourcing have been proposed, there are few empirical tests of different strategies. In this project, multiple genetic provenances of <em>Banksia menziesii</em>, a restoration priority plant species on the Swan Coastal Plain, were tested in post-mining rehabilitation field sites, as well as glasshouse growth trials where environmental parameters were modified. In addition, physical, chemical and biological properties of soils from these multiple source sites were assessed and compared to the performance of seeds sourced from these sites.</p>
<p>The project is complete and key findings included glasshouse studies that showed seedlings sourced from wetter regions showed higher growth and mortality when exposed to drought, whereas plants from drier seed sources had lower growth and did not show mortality when exposed to drought. Soil microbiome community and physicochemical analyses from remnant populations of <em>Banksia menziesii</em> across its range showed significant correlations between soil microbiome, soil physicochemical and climate distances. Results of a field trial identified that seed from drier provenances did not show superiority under initial field conditions. All results have been interpreted to better inform seed sourcing strategies under changing environmental conditions.</p>",12
3027,2021,"<p>Projections of future climate-related impacts to coral reefs are important for management decisions. For coral reefs, climate-related projections have largely focused on temperature stress and less so on other climate stressors, such as cyclones. Tropical cyclones can generate large waves that cause long-term physical damage to reefs and at the same time cause mixing and upwelling of deeper waters, thus reducing thermal stress. Tropical cyclone projections exist at a relevant spatial scale for management but are rarely included in assessments of future climate exposure. To assess the combined effects of tropical cyclones and thermal stress on coral reefs under future climate change, this study will model the impacts of future changes in tropical cyclones and thermal stress events on the cover of coral reefs in Australia using high-resolution tropical cyclone and&nbsp;thermal stress products. This research will identify specific areas of low vulnerability (low exposure and/or&nbsp;low sensitivity) and areas for more targeted conservation strategies.</p>",10
3075,2021,"<p>The jarrah (<em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>) and karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>) forests of south-west Western Australia provide a variety of values including timber, wildlife habitat and water. However, as climate changes, issues of forest productivity, tree health and mortality, and water yield need to be addressed. Individual-based modelling (IBM) is an ecological modelling approach that represents individuals within populations or communities, and the interactions between them, with a relatively high level of detail and complexity. This study aims to develop an IBM of tree growth in water limited environments, to parameterise the model for jarrah and karri and to predict the impact of tree thinning on timber production, tree health and mortality and water yield using time series data collected from 1965 and 1992, respectively.</p>
<p>For both species, thinning has a positive impact on growth, with stand growth optimised at intermediate densities (10-20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>) over multi-decadal time periods, consistent with findings from previous studies. Thinning also influences allometry of stem diameter with height, ratio of height and diameter, crown width and bark thickness.&nbsp; Two papers reporting the effects of stand density and competition from neighbouring trees on the growth of jarrah have been published in <em>Forest Ecology and Management</em>.

2549,2019,"<p>This project aims to improve our understanding of local adaption and phylogeographic patterns in parasitic and non-parasitic plant species&rsquo; important for mine site restoration in Western Australia. Range-wide sampling and next generation sequencing technologies will be utilised to examine: signals of adaptive genetic variation; and phylogeographic patterns for four plant species endemic to Western Australia. The research will determine whether generalist and limited host-specific parasitic species have similar adaptive variation and phylogeographic patterns compared to sympatric non-parasitic plants. Species distributions will be extrapolated using spatial modelling to predict patterns of adaptive genetic variability across the landscape and develop a tool to guide seed sourcing for restoration.</p>

2523,2019,"<p>Dibblers (<em>Parantechinus apicalis</em>) are ranked as Endangered and have a limited area of occupancy in the south-west and on islands off the midwest coast of Western Australia. Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught dibblers is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Dibblers are one of the species intended for reintroduction to Dirk Hartog Island following cat and goat eradication, and this will be achieved through captive breeding of animals sourced from the midwest islands.</p>
<p>The project aims to: (1) produce a literature review of the Dasyuridae family with a specific focus on dibblers; (2) identify known hazards associated with the dibbler translocation and undertake a risk assessment; (3) investigate how commensal or potentially pathogenic parasites can be conserved through modification of therapeutic regimes to ensure native parasites are maintained in the reintroduced population; (4) consider disease risk management options and advise on future screening protocols for dibbler translocations; (5) supplement existing knowledge by collecting samples from wild caught animals for the captive breeding program for disease screening; and (6) present a summary of findings and the implications for managing future dibbler translocations.</p>
<p>A Disease Risk Analysis (DRA) has been produced to facilitate the success of the translocation and inform on any potential hazards and make recommendations to accommodate these hazards. A list of infectious and non-infectious hazards were identified of which two hazards were investigated further, these being gastrointestinal parasites and trypanosomes. The majority of the animals for captive breeding were assessed to be in good health and body condition. Previously recorded gastrointestinal parasites (strongyles and <em>Coccidia</em>) were recorded in the island populations along with a potential new finding of <em>Klossiella</em>;&nbsp;however, further investigation is required to confirm this.&nbsp;<em>Demodex</em> mites are present in populations on the Jurien Bay islands and are causing pathological disease in the form of demodectomas. There was no evidence of infection with <em>Trypanosoma </em>spp.; however, it is possible this pathogen is present at levels below detection limits. Further sampling over a longer temporal span of the populations is required to confirm presence/absence. The DRA has identified a number of knowledge gaps in baseline health and disease in wild dibbler populations. Whilst there is an extensive list of parasites and diseases for Dasyuridae in general, the known parasite list of dibblers is extremely low, and this study has identified priorities for further studies.</p>",8

The primary aim of this study is to quantify characteristics of northern quoll natural denning habitat in order to understand necessary conditions to be replicated as part of future artificial habitat creation.</p>
<p>Results have indicated that female northern quolls prefer crevices that are cooler and deeper, most likely to avoid lethal temperatures and provide protection from predators. While artificial dens supply appropriate thermal properties, there are differences in physical structure, vegetation structure, and prey availability when compared to occupied dens. These differences must be addressed if artificial dens are to be a plausible mitigation strategy for northern quoll habitat loss.​ Draft manuscripts for publication are being prepared.</p>",8
2550,2019,"<p><em>Reedia spathacea</em> (Cyperaceae) is a species of sedge found in the peat swamps of the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographical regions. The growth habit is particular to the species and it has apical meristems and above ground rhizomes protected by retained leaf sheaths with lateral roots that act as a means of clonal dispersal. Knowledge of morphology and reproductive strategy remain poorly known. The species is currently listed as Critically Endangered and occurs in ecological communities that are threatened by feral pig damage, increased fire frequency, weed invasion, fluctuations in&nbsp;water quality and changes to land use, such as groundwater extraction and land clearing. This study aims to evaluate the morphology and ecology of the species and to determine it's genetic structure and historical biogeography.

These frogs lay large clutches of eggs; however, the survival rate to adult frogs is low. Captive rearing of eggs to metamorphs is an effective means of providing supplementation of animals into the populations. Eggs clutches of both species are collected from the wild and metamorphs are raised and subsequently released. This project is part of the ongoing research and husbandry management to achieve regular and reliable captive breeding in both species.</p>
<p>To quantify the effect of temperature on development rates of <em>G.</em> <em>vitellina</em> embryos, incubation of seven <em>G. vitellina </em>clutches were split across three temperature treatments (constant 20 &deg;C, constant 24.5 &deg;C, and a fluctuating 24.5 &plusmn; 5 &deg;C) chosen based on available field temperature data and expert consultation. However, the two warmer treatments resulted in unexpected abnormality and mortality of 36 embryos after 5 days so the treatment temperatures were reduced to constant 19.5 &deg;C, constant 20.5 &deg;C, and fluctuating 20.5 &plusmn; 2 &deg;C, and the remaining healthy embryos successfully developed to metamorphosis. Results show that some juveniles exposed to the initial warmer temperatures are gaining weight more slowly than those that were exposed to the lower temperature. From the data obtained during the experiment, a non-linear development rate function for <em>G. vitellina has been developed, </em>but empirical development rate data collected across a wider span of incubation temperatures are needed to confirm the shape of the function and to better estimate peak development rates. Juvenile frogs from the seven clutches of <em>G. vitellina </em>that were the subject to the initial incubator temperature trial have had their second round of weighing and tank changes at approximately 18 weeks post-metamorphosis. The <em>G. vitellina</em> juveniles incubated at the two higher temperature treatments continue to develop at a slower rate (190% and 200% increase post-metamorphosis) than those incubated at the lower temperatures (307% increase).</p>",8

The threatening processes impacting on <em>Banksia</em> woodland include further land clearing, fragmentation, weed invasion, inappropriate fire regimes, altered hydrological processes, disease due to <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> and a drying climate. This project aims to address knowledge gaps for improving the understanding of <em>Banksia</em> woodland floristic communities with a focus on SCP20a through a meta-analysis of Swan Coastal Plain data, combined with targeted assessment of new sites and re-assessment of existing sites with the aim of detecting change. The study also aims to integrate spatial analysis of environmental factors with biological data to identify predictive capability and assess risk to <em>Banksia</em> woodlands using the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria, with reference to alternative risk assessment techniques.</p>
<p>Targeted field surveys have been completed over the past two years for a selection of SCP20a sites. In addition, a meta-dataset of Swan Coastal Plain floristic plots has been developed, collating data from government, consulting and other sources. The data set has been subjected to revision to allow for reliable comparison over time using current nomenclature. Initial meta-analysis of the consolidated data set has occurred and is being used to target specific <em>Banksia</em> woodland sites for follow-up assessment. A final season of targeted surveys is occurring along with closure of the meta-dataset to allow for completion of the project.</p>",8
3058,2021,"<p>Understanding the habitat requirements of animals and how this influences their distribution is essential for effective management. Ongoing shifts in habitat due to changing climate and acute environmental disturbance emphasise the need to understand how changes in habitat affect associated fauna. Epinephelid serranids are ecologically important predators on tropical reefs that are an attraction for recreational fishermen. This project will focus on the habitat requirements of epinepheline serranids at Ningaloo Marine Park, exploring mechanisms that influence their distribution, abundance and productivity. The project will examine fish within two prominent habitat types at Ningaloo, macroalgae and corals, that also represent extremes of the current regime shift paradigm on tropical reefs.</p>
<p>After describing broadscale habitat associations of epinephelids and finer scale habitat use by <em>Epinephelus rivulatus</em> in macroalgal habitats, the project is now focused on understanding how variation in fine scale habitat affects the condition and productivity of these fish. Accordingly, 5-8 <em>E. rivulatus</em> have been collected from fifteen macroalgal patches with different habitat characteristics (total 105 fish). Growth rates of these fish will be assessed by sectioning and reading otoliths (ear bones). Combined with local estimates of abundance, growth rates from each patch will provide an indication of how productivity varies among macroalgal habitats. Information that will help identify which patches are important for sustaining local recreational fisheries.</p>",10
2565,2019,"<p>This project seeks to enhance understanding of the ecological response of a variety of vegetation types to bushfire, focusing on the large O&rsquo;Sullivan fire of February 2015.

<p>Fire severity has been determined from remotely sensed imagery. Field data have being collected at 48 sites and include details of overstorey composition and crown condition, seedling germination and survival, and understorey plant composition. Fungal community composition was determined using DNA extracted from soil samples, amplifying the fungal ITS2 region, to estimate relative abundance of fungal taxonomic entities. Results to date are being prepared for publication.</p>",8
2544,2019,"<p>The study aims to explore the hypothesis that northern quolls previously utilised a range of different habitat types in their movement and foraging activities in the Pilbara, but pressure from predators (feral cats, foxes and dingoes), in conjunction with other threats such as grazing and fire, have restricted their occurrence to the more protected rocky habitat.</p>
<p>The primary data collection phase is now complete, culminating in a total of 49,433 trap nights, 1,923 independent northern quoll detections and hundreds of feral predator detections. Northern quolls were detected at 69% of study landscapes. Detections were collected using camera traps orientated in either a horizontal or vertical direction, and a comparison of the efficacy of either orientation at detecting quolls along with other target species is currently in preparation for publication. Using vertically orientated cameras, over 100 northern quolls were identified based on unique spot patterning. By combining this data with detailed habitat assessments, the process of constructing comprehensive occupancy models that will provide crucial insight into the way in which quolls interact with both predators and their environment has commenced. Finally, 11 GPS collars have been deployed to elucidate the fine-scale spatial and temporal movements of northern quolls.</p>",8
2762,2020,"<p>Salt lakes are a distinctive feature of Western Australian inland areas. Several invertebrate groups appear to be far more diverse in Western Australia than anywhere else in Australia and even globally, probably reflecting the long history of aridification and the now disjunct occurrence of this type of wetland in the State. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing (especially in the Wheatbelt) and increasingly, by mining on or near the lake bed. The first goal of the project is to use mitochondrial DNA data and, if necessary, nuclear DNA data, to assess the validity of the morpho-taxonomy of genus <em>Australocypris</em>, which is one of the most diverse genera in Australian salt lakes. The second goal is to use molecular data to test alternative hypotheses about species radiations in <em>Australocypris</em>, whose evolutionary history is largely unknown. The final goal is to develop a protocol for hatching and raising adult ostracods from resting eggs in mud samples collected from dry lakes, as a substitute for collecting active ostracods.</p>
<p>A review of the biology of non-marine giant ostracods (Crustacea, Cyprididae, Mytilocypridini) is being prepared for publication.

2489,2019,"<p>Restoration of degraded land following mining is challenged by factors including the limited availability of natural topsoil and low soil fertility. This project aims to assess the effectiveness of current practices in rehabilitation in the Pilbara including the use of soil amendments to improve soil function and seedling recruitment.</p>
<p>A glasshouse study examining how the inorganic amendments gypsum and urea affects plant growth and substrate quality has been completed. The addition of urea to mine waste substrates produced a 3-fold increase in plant growth of <em>Acacia inaequilatera</em>, and up to a 25-fold increase in growth of <em>Triodia wiseana </em>when grown under high watering regimes, but this effect was not evident in a low watering regime. The amendments decreased substrate pH and increased electrical conductivity, total nitrogen and N-mineralisation, but did not have an effect on soil microbial activity. Overall, water was the dominant driver for determining the effectiveness of the amendments to improve the quality of mine waste substrates and increase plant growth. In an arid region characterised by erratic, unreliable and often intense rainfall events, these results indicate that limited water will minimise plant access to inorganic amendments and restrict their effectiveness.</p>",8

2777,2020,"<p>In 2016, Galapagos National Park authorities increased the surface area of full no-take areas in the Galapagos Marine Reserves from 0.8% to 33%. However, no specific measures (e.g. seasonal closure, maximum or minimum size limit, quotas) have been implemented to mitigate the downward trends observed in fisheries targeted species outside of the reserve. As a consequence, new fish resources are being sought in deeper waters. The project aims to assess the effect of the Galapagos Marine Reserve, changes in fisher effort and environment on fish assemblages in the Galapagos. The results of conservation approaches in the Galapagos can be compared and contrasted to Western Australia to inform and potentially improve on the monitoring and conservation of marine fishes in both locations.</p>

Stereo-DOVs are the primary method used to monitor finfish in Western Australia&rsquo;s&rsquo; marine parks and this study shows that diver operated stereo-video system produce accurate measures of fish length, density and reproductive behaviours, providing an easily repeatable and non-destructive tool for the monitoring of spawning events.</p>",9
2759,2020,"<p>Forests are an essential asset for the provision and regulation of ecosystem services and culture and heritage. How trees regenerate and adapt to a changing environment is a concern given the expected increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of drought and heatwave events, coupled with wildfires.

This project is investigating the success of translocation in <em>Banksia brownii</em> and <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa</em>&nbsp;and aims to: (1) compare the mating systems and genetic diversity of translocated populations with wild populations; (2) determine how reproductive output and progeny performance of translocated populations compares to wild populations; and (3) assess the efficacy of using measures of mating system parameters, genetic diversity and reproductive potential to better understand translocation success. The findings have a number of potential implications for not only assessing long term translocation success, but for also improving translocation design and establishment technologies.</p>
<p>Mating system and genetic diversity analysis has been completed on one translocated&nbsp;<em>B. brownii</em>&nbsp;population and four wild populations to benchmark mating system performance and genetic diversity in the translocated population. Reproductive output and pollination studies are complete and data has been combined with mating system and genetic diversity data to produce a draft manuscript for publication. Fitness trait studies are ongoing in a common garden experiment involving 500 seedlings to assess the performance of the translocated population in comparison to wild populations. Reproductive output measurements, seed and adult leaf material were collected from three natural and two translocated populations of <em>Acacia rhetinocarpa, </em>to benchmark genetic diversity and reproductive output in the translocated populations.

2828,2020,"<p>Anthropogenic loss and fragmentation of natural habitats has been increasing during the last 60 years and is now at unprecedented levels, making land use change one of the most important drivers affecting biodiversity. <em>Conospermum undulatum</em> is endemic to south-west Western Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. Significant reductions in population size, connectivity, area and floral display of remnant patches are likely to constrain the reproduction of this species by altered plant-pollinator interactions and expression of inbreeding depression because of reduced gene flow between unrelated individuals. This project will investigate the reproductive biology and genetic diversity in the species to inform recovery actions to enhance the future persistence of <em>C. undulatum </em>by means of an improved understanding of factors that constrain both its reproduction and its adaptation ability over the long-term.</p>
<p>The pollination study showed that cross-pollination by hand produced a ten-fold increase in seed production compared to natural pollination. Increased seed set using pollen sourced from different populations showed that small populations are producing approximately&nbsp;50 percent less seeds than what they are able to produce via inter-population cross-breeding due to the combined effects of pollen limitation and reduction in compatible mate availability. Genetic analysis of populations using 19 microsatellite loci revealed weak genetic structure, and levels of genetic diversity and differentiation indices indicate high levels of gene flow prior to fragmentation. These results suggest that habitat fragmentation may result in patches that are too small and isolated to be attractive for pollinators and to allow a long-term population viability based on reproduction by seed. Pollinator assessment showed <em>C. undulatum</em> has evolved pollen with resistance to the usually negative effect of ant secretions on pollen grains, with ants providing effective pollination services to this threatened species.</p>",9

Range-wide sampling and next generation sequencing technologies will be utilised to examine: signals of adaptive genetic variation; and phylogeographic patterns for four plant species endemic to Western Australia. The research will determine whether generalist and limited host-specific parasitic species have similar adaptive variation and phylogeographic patterns compared to sympatric non-parasitic plants. Species distributions will be extrapolated using spatial modelling to predict patterns of adaptive genetic variability across the landscape and develop a tool to guide seed sourcing for restoration.</p>
<p>Analysis of adaptive variation and phylogeographical patterns has been completed for all four species. A stronger genomic signal of selection was observed in the host-specific parasite (<em>Amyema gibberula </em>var. <em>tatei</em>) compared to its primary host species (<em>Hakea recurva</em> subsp. <em>recurva</em>), but this was not observed for the generalist parasite (<em>Nuytsia floribunda</em>) compared to a co-occurring autotroph (<em>Melaleuca rhaphiophylla</em>). Patterns of local adaptation to climate show adaptive genomic diversity in parasitic species to be associated more with temperature, rather than precipitation variables, while the opposite is observed for the non-parasitic species. Phylogeographical analysis showed the parasitic plants to have lower genetic diversity and greater population structuring than co-occurring autotrophic plants. Spatial modelling has been used to predict patterns of adaptive genetic variability in all four species and the development of tool to guide seed sourcing for restoration is currently underway.</p>",9

3251,2022,"<p>The status of local populations of a species must be assessed prior to further supplementary translocations. Brushtail possums were reintroduced to the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area in 2007 under the assumption that the local population was extinct. Concerns were raised about potential bottlenecking of sub-populations of the translocated possums in 2017. This project investigated whether viable genetic material could be collected from brushtail possums in the arid zone via baited tracking tunnels; whether there is ongoing evidence of inbreeding or genetic bottlenecking in the brushtail possum population on Matuwa; and whether the phylogenetics of brushtail possums in the arid zone can be assessed through fecal or hair DNA collected through non-invasive techniques.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, viable DNA could not be extracted from either tracking tunnels or relatively fresh possum scats collected near trees. DNA was extracted from two out of 20 preserved possum skins held by the WA Museum, one from Cranbrook and a second from Bendering.

3531,2023,"<p>The captive breeding for release program at Perth Zoo for the Western Swamp Tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) makes an essential contribution to the species&rsquo; long-term conservation prospects. In doing so, the program has generated a considerable database on the biology of the captive population. This study investigated retrospective data collected across a total of 9 breeding seasons (years) to determine the factors that influence the species&rsquo; growth and reproduction in captivity.</p>
<p>Diet was the main factor focussed on since nutrition provision is a key husbandry area that is made difficult trying to replicate a species&rsquo; highly specialised wild diet in captivity to a large-scale breeding program. Minor nutritional differences were found between the predominantly red-meat and white-meat only captive diets; the white diet had slightly higher protein and protein to energy ratio, while the red diet had a higher fat content. Captive diets fed to offspring did not show consistent differences for all juvenile growth or aestivation periods. Where differences did occur, the red diet yielded a significantly higher specific growth rate than the white diet. Captive diet fed to breeding females was a more prevalent factor across the reproductive variables with a general, but again not consistent, trend of (where it occurred) the white diet having significantly higher reproductive performance than the red diet. Given the species resilience to reproduce and grow in captivity regardless of minimal nutritional differences, the white captive diet is recommended as more appropriate to the breeding program overall. Of all the factors examined, the variability between breeding seasons was the most consistently significant difference for growth and reproductive variables. These findings considered together highlight the multi-factorial relationship between nutrition, growth and reproduction and the areas still needing further research, like environmental factors in captive breeding settings themselves.</p>",12

2480,2019,"<p>Monitoring programs that aim to measure the diversity, abundance and biomass of fishes depend on accurate and reliable biological data to guide the development and implementation of robust management plans. It is important to implement an appropriate sampling technique that provides a comprehensive assessment, while reducing associated biases in the data collection process. Ongoing advancements in technology can provide new opportunities for collecting fish assemblage data, overcoming limitations and biases of more traditional approaches. This project aims to compare the sampling abilities of four different, underwater stereo-video methods, two of which are relatively new methodologies (slow-towed stereo-video (STV) and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) fitted with a stereo-video), in a temperate reef system within Geographe Bay. This information can be used to inform monitoring and research programs on which methods are most effective for sampling fishes of varying life histories.</p>

2500,2019,"<p>Compared to other regions around the globe, the South West Australian Floristic Region has an exceptionally high incidence of plant species that are predominantly pollinated by vertebrates, with approximately 2,000 species pollinated by birds. The behaviour of these birds suggests unique genetic consequences for the plants they pollinate. A combination of genetic techniques and field experiments with <em>Eucalyptus caesia</em>&nbsp;were used to examine three critical issues in pollination ecology and reproductive biology: (1) the relative contribution of native and introduced animals to pollen dispersal in plants adapted for bird pollination; (2) whether genetic factors such as heterozygosity and sibling relatedness influence seedling fitness; and (3) the consequences of bird pollination in range-wide genetic diversity.</p>
<p>A comprehensive population genetic analysis of all known plants in all known populations with 14 microsatellite markers demonstrated low genetic diversity, extensive clonality and strong population genetic differentiation. Assessment of a rare natural recruitment event showed no evidence for inbreeding depression. A weak association between geographic distance and genetic distance indicated a randomness to historical dispersal at a landscape scale. A common garden trial showed no association between seedling mortality and vigour with individual heterozygosity across multiple substrates. These results suggest that purging of genetic load as well as individual longevity explains the persistence of woody perennial plants endemic to granite outcrops, despite historically small population sizes. Pollinator exclusion experiments showed that bird-pollination increases paternal diversity above that of insect pollination in some populations, suggesting that insects may be effective pollinators in some populations but ineffective in others. Collectively, these results show that conservation of old individual trees and small populations is integral to conserve the genetic diversity of historically fragmented woody perennials.</p>",8
2529,2019,"<p>Fire is a dominant disturbance that shapes the structure, composition and function of ecosystems around the world. This process has been occurring in the Australian landscape for millennia and such a long engagement with fire means that plants have developed strategies and adaptations to cope with this disturbance in the landscape. It is important to note that species are built on a tolerance to certain patterns of fire (the fire regime) rather than simply to fire itself. If fire occurs too frequently, too intensely, or otherwise outside of the limits of a species tolerance, then populations are likely to decline or disappear. This project aims to determine the impact of varying fire regimes on the demographics of key <em>Banksia </em>woodland plant species. This knowledge will be used to identify potential limits to a species tolerance of fire using a Bayesian network modelling approach.</p>
<p>Using a space-for-time approach, surveys of population size structure, flowering, and canopy seed bank were conducted for six common shrub and tree species along a fire age chronosequence. Population size structures suggest that interfire recruitment may play a large role in the population dynamics of some species, possibly allowing them to persist for longer than expected in the long absence of fire. Juvenile periods ranged from 1.4-4.8 years and varied for resprouters vs obligate seeders, canopy- vs soil-stored species, and depending on the previous season of fire. Canopy seed banks did not accumulate over time, consistent with observations that canopy-stored species in <em>Banksia</em> woodland are weakly serotinous. A separate controlled field experiment has shown that the timing of seed planting throughout the year (emulating the timing of fire) influences seedling recruitment, where recruitment is best when seeds are cued for germination immediately prior to winter rainfall. All data collection has been completed, and data analyses and writing are close to completion.</p>",8
2482,2019,"<p>The life history traits of many shark species, including large body size, slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, makes them particularly vulnerable to over-fishing and other anthropogenic threats.

Little is known of essential habitats of sharks and why sharks choose one habitat over another as a nursery ground. Sharks are often depicted poorly and the public opinion and attitude towards them can significantly affect the implementation and success of conservation initiates. However, sharks play important ecological and socioeconomic roles and the consequences of population declines are not well studied. This research will identify nursery habitats and compare cultural beliefs and public attitudes towards sharks in areas where sharks are depleted (e.g. Bangladesh) to areas where they are relatively healthy (e.g. Australia). To understand the drivers of peoples perceptions of sharks, socioeconomic surveys will be implemented across a broad range of stakeholders in these regions. This information will be used to develop educational strategies aimed at improving the conservation of sharks.</p>

2831,2020,"<p>There has been a significant amount of research conducted in northern Australia regarding fire regimes and their effect on savanna systems. However, the fire ecology of tree hollows has not been studied in northern Australia. It has been suggested that the drivers of tree hollow development and retention will be different to that known from studies in southern Australia, as savanna systems experience different fire regimes and are subjected to additional processes such as cyclone events and termite activity. Tree hollows are an important ecological resource for around 40 percent of vertebrates in the Top End including mammals, reptiles and birds. Developing optimal strategies for managing fire for arboreal mammals and thresholds of hollow abundance mediated by fire frequency and intensity will be a major advance in our understanding of Australian forest ecology and conservation in northern Australia.</p>
<p>This research into hollow use by multiple arboreal groups, including both competitors and potential predators, and also the action of termites in blocking off tree hollows, has highlighted the relative shortage of this resource for threatened mammals. Statistical modelling is currently underway to determine the effects of fire mosaics on tree hollow availability. This study has already shown that large hollows, which are preferred by threatened arboreal mammals, are more common in savannas where late dry season wildfires and cyclones are less frequent. Although considerable overlap in use of hollows exists between arboreal mammals, some niche differentiation occurs. The smallest of the species, <em>Conilurus penicillatus</em>, preferentially uses hollows closer to the ground and in dead trees and logs, which may increase the impacts of terrestrial threat to this species including fires and predation by feral cats.</p>",9
3036,2021,"<p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is endemic to south-west Australia and occupies seasonal wetlands where hydroperiods are shortening due to declining rainfall. Trial translocations 300-400 kilometres south of their current habitat began in 2016 to test whether <em>P. umbrina</em> can grow in cooler climates where hydroperiods are likely to be more suitable in the future. Such intentional translocations of a species outside its indigenous range to mitigate the effect of climate change is known as assisted colonisation. Results of the recent assisted colonisation trials were mixed, and suitable food availability was thought to be a key component of a successful short trial in the east Augusta region. The main aim of this research is to understand whether energy requirements of the western swamp tortoise can be met in cooler climates. This will be achieved by: 1) developing novel environmental DNA methods to detect the species and determine tortoises' diet in new habitats; 2) documenting foraging behaviour in a southern wetland in relation to water temperatures and prey availability; and 3) linking metabolic processes and food intake to predict long-term growth rates and reproduction of individuals released into new environments. This project will provide greater certainty on whether southern wetlands can provide viable habitat for this critically endangered species in the near future.</p>
<p>Candidate wetlands were evaluated in the East Augusta region in 2020, which resulted in the selection of release sites for the third western swamp tortoise assisted colonisation trial. Release sites were chosen based on water quality parameters and potential prey availability. The release will take place August 2021. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods will be tested as a monitoring tool during the assisted colonisation trial. Western swamp tortoise specific eDNA assays have been developed and are undergoing optimisation and specification tests.</p>",10

It is hypothesised that eDNA will detect the same range of fish species as fyke netting and will have a greater sensitivity in detecting species in low densities. This research will further the development of an eDNA monitoring protocol to complement traditional methods, leading to the potential for improved stewardship of biodiversity in waterways.</p>

3082,2021,"<p>This project aims to improve our understanding of local adaption and phylogeographic patterns in parasitic and non-parasitic plant species important for mine site restoration in Western Australia. Range-wide sampling and next generation sequencing technologies will be utilised to examine: signals of adaptive genetic variation; and phylogeographic patterns for four plant species endemic to Western Australia. The research will determine whether generalist and limited host-specific parasitic species have similar adaptive variation and phylogeographic patterns compared to sympatric non-parasitic plants. Species distributions will be extrapolated using spatial modelling to predict patterns of adaptive genetic variability across the landscape and develop a tool to guide seed sourcing for restoration.</p>
<p>Analysis of adaptive variation and phylogeographical patterns has been completed for all four species. A stronger genomic signal of selection was observed in the host-specific parasite (<em>Amyema gibberula </em>var. <em>tatei</em>) compared to its primary host species (<em>Hakea recurva</em> subsp. <em>recurva</em>), but this was not observed for the generalist parasite (<em>Nuytsia floribunda</em>) compared to a co-occurring autotroph (<em>Melaleuca rhaphiophylla</em>). Patterns of local adaptation to climate show adaptive genomic diversity in parasitic species to be associated more with temperature than precipitation variables, while the opposite is observed for the non-parasitic species. Phylogeographical analysis showed the parasitic plants to have lower genetic diversity and greater population structuring than co-occurring autotrophic plants. Spatial modelling has been used to predict patterns of adaptive genetic variability in all four species and the development of tool to guide seed sourcing for restoration is currently underway.

3019,2021,"<p>Small populations, particularly those on islands, lose genetic diversity as a result of strong genetic drift and may accumulate genetic load (deleterious genetic mutations). Fauna declines on mainland Australia mean that threatened species conservation requires effective management of different types of &ldquo;island&rdquo; populations &ndash; continental islands, mainland remnants resulting from range collapse, and increasingly, translocations into predator-free environments (fenced exclosures or pest-free islands). Management aimed at reinstating gene flow between isolated populations via population mixing (through translocation or augmentation) is advocated to halt genetic diversity decline. However, it may risk impacts to population fitness through outbreeding depression or maladaptation when source and recipient environments are very different. This project will focus on several threatened mammals restricted to &ldquo;islands&rdquo; (offshore islands and mainland fenced reserves): the burrowing bettong (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>), rufous hare-wallaby (<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>), golden bandicoot (<em>Isoodon auratus</em>) and the dibbler (<em>Parantechinus apicalis</em>). The aims are to quantify phenotypic and genetic divergence amongst island and mainland populations to determine whether genetic and morphological differentiation between remnant populations reflects divergent adaptation or are artefacts of genetic drift, and the consequences for mixing populations of each species.

3042,2021,"<p>This project will examine predator-prey interactions between ghost crabs and hatchling sea turtles on the Ningaloo coast to better conserve these threatened turtle species and manage a native predator. It will provide critical information for the management of marine turtles and their rookeries and help fill a gap in the scientific literature regarding the potential impact of native ghost crabs on turtle eggs and hatchling survival. This will help assess vulnerability of different nesting sites and determine if there is need for human intervention.</p>
<p>In the second&nbsp;summer two more field trips were completed to Gnaraloo Bay and Cape Range National Park, totaling 58 days in the field. An additional 1100 ghost crab burrows were counted and measured. Start- and end-of-season inventories were conducted on 34 loggerhead turtle nests. Hatchling emergence and predation were recorded at 25 loggerhead turtle nests from which the fate of 575 hatchlings was determined. The data is being analysed and two journal publications are being prepared.</p>",10
2813,2020,"<p>In fire-prone ecosystems, recruitment from seeds following fire is prolific and provides a pathway for populations to expand into new niches and persist through fire. For many species, recruitment from seed is their only means of population recovery following fire events, so seed survival through fire is vital in order to maximise post-fire recruitment. This project aimed to measure spatially diverse temperatures within soil during fire, examine lethal tolerances of seeds to elevated temperatures associated with fire, establish interactions between lethal tolerances and emergence behaviour and predict weather conditions that may decrease seeds ability to survive fire events.</p>
<p>Three papers have been published directly from this project: (1) a new method was developed for measuring soil temperatures during fire using distributed temperature sensing within optic fibre to sample spatial and temporal patterns with a much greater extent than previously possible; (2) a negative relationship was identified between seed moisture and lethal temperature thresholds of seeds; and (3) relationships between fuel loads and temperature penetration into soils were analysed, as well as the depth from which seeds are able to emerge from soils and their lethal temperature thresholds. In particular, this study has discerned than even though larger seeds can emerge from deeper within the soil, they are not necessarily better at surviving elevated soil temperatures.</p>",9
2824,2020,"<p>This study aims to improve the understanding of the numbat population in the Upper Warren region, to inform management for the conservation of this endangered species.

<p>Different camera trap models and set up options were evaluated to improve numbat detection. Swift 3C wide angle camera traps set at 25 cm above ground performed best. Sign surveys detected numbats more efficiently than driven transects and camera trapping. To further explore and improve camera trapping for Upper Warren native species including numbats, a field trial established that Reconyx PC900/HC600 camera traps missed 54 percent of known animal visits while Swift 3C wide-angle camera traps missed only 0.5 percent. A broad scale survey of 78 study sites with varying habitat and management characteristics was undertaken. Numbats appear to be generalists with no clear preference for any key habitat or management type in the Upper Warren region.</p>",9
3063,2021,"<p>Mining companies have a legal responsibility to return native biota to post-mining environments; however, ecological restoration is challenging, especially in water limited environments. The chemical and physical properties of substrates do not always explain high seedling mortality therefore other factors such as drought should be explored.

<p>Data analysis has progressed and synthesis of a glasshouse trial investigating how preconditioning seedlings to water stress influences tolerance to subsequent drought has been completed. Water availability during the first five months of seedling growth strongly influenced physiological performance under subsequent terminal drought; however, shifts in biomass allocation did not account for this variation. Frequency and amounts of water provided during preconditioning are critical factors in determining subsequent drought tolerance of outplanted seedlings.</p>",10
3037,2021,"<p>Identifying and protecting core habitat and dispersal corridors is the cornerstone of best-practice conservation in multi-use landscapes. While genetic methods are regularly employed to identify historical refugia (core habitat) for species, information on dispersal and landscape connectivity is hampered by the lack of empirical data on species dispersal to inform mechanistic models. Landscape genetics is an emerging research field that quantifies gene flow as a proxy for realised dispersal to assess landscape connectivity and infer dispersal corridors (or landscape barriers) to aid in spatial conservation planning. The aims of this project are to 1) determine landscape barriers to dispersal in the Pilbara for three mammal species (<em>Pseudomys hermannsbergensis, Ningaui timealeyi and P. chapmani</em>), 2) identify landscape attributes that are linked to gene flow, 3) compare two different genetic markers, and 4) use simulation modelling to validate empirical landscape genetic findings. Genomic markers (SNPs) were employed to identify population structure using three non-Bayesian population clustering methods implemented in R and compared to results from microsatellite data.</p>
<p>Landscape genetic effects were tested using constrained pairwise commute-time distances in a linear mixed model. Two genetically distinct <em>N. timealeyi</em> populations were resolved using the SNP data that were not detected in the microsatellite data. The rodents exhibited no signs of spatial genetic structure. South-facing slopes possibly facilitate gene flow in <em>N. timealeyi </em>and <em>P. chapmani</em>, perhaps due to higher protection against solar radiation and higher moisture content, whereas sandy substrate seemed to facilitate gene flow in <em>P. hermannsburgensis</em>. Further landscape genetic analyses are being undertaken and a manuscript is currently in preparation.</p>",10
2823,2020,"<p>This study aims to study the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in the genus <em>Tecticornia </em>(Chenopodiaceae) at the molecular and anatomical levels. The genus includes two species identified as using the C<sub>4 </sub>photosynthetic pathway, and 39 species currently categorised as C<sub>3 </sub>plants.</p>
<p>The project has contributed to the resolution of relationships between species of <em>Tecticornia</em>&nbsp;using molecular phylogentic data and identified C<sub>3</sub> species most closely related to C<sub>4 </sub>species. However, further molecular and anatomical analyses identified <em>Tecticornia auriculata</em>, a species that is not particularly closely related to the C<sub>4</sub> clade, as being a C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>intermediate. <em>T. auriculata </em>has C<sub>4</sub>-like anatomical features, an increased investment of organelles in lower mesophyll cells, and lower levels of photorespiration compared to other C<sub>3</sub> species. By looking at C<sub>3</sub>, intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> <em>Tecticornia</em> species, the steps in the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in this genus seem to deviate from the most widely accepted model of C<sub>4 </sub>evolution. <em>Tecticornia </em>species have ultrastructural differences in upper and lower mesophyll cells, rather than mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Lower cells are not enlarged, and changes in GDC-P localisation do not seem to play a major role. The steps towards C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in <em>Tecticornia</em> follow the model in other ways, with an increased investment in organelles in lower cells being an important step. The unusual anatomy of succulent articles and the halophytic habit of <em>Tecticornia </em>may explain this unusual route towards C<sub>4 </sub>photosynthesis.</p>",9
3275,2022,"<p>The age of water utilised by trees may prove to be a useful indicator of the resilience of forests to drought and heat stress, and for assessing impacts of forest management to the unsaturated zone hydrology experienced by trees. Isotope methods have been previously developed to identify potential different water sources used by tress, e.g. groundwater versus shallow soil moisture, when these sources have distinct isotopic signatures. This method seeks to use isotopes to establish how long since the water fell as rain did it reside in the soil before it was used by the plant for transpiration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A multidisciplinary laboratory experiment was completed to assess the potential of the method. A total of eight plants were installed in gas chambers and over a period of two weeks the isotopic composition of chamber air was measured at 1 second intervals. The results demonstrated the ability of the method to quantify the proportion of ""new"" water transpired by each sapling. The data from the chamber experiment have now been curated for use with a new model to estimate the water ages. Initial testing of the model indicated modifications were required in order to more accurately reproduce observations.&nbsp; Model testing is underway, as is the preparation of a journal article to report on the model and the experiment.</p>",11
3032,2021,"<p>This project aims to examine the effects of cryopreservation on metabolism of plant tissues, with emphasis on mitochondrial function as these organelles are the primary sources of energy molecules (ATP) that drive all cellular processes including the ability to recover from injury sustained to cells and tissues during the various steps of cryopreservation. A better understanding of the effects of cryogenic injury will enable better optimisation of cryopreservation for sensitive species, including many threatened taxa where ex situ storage remains a problem. Initial trials measuring oxygen consumption of Daucus carota cells have been completed on the Seahorse XF analyser at Curtin University. Follow-up experiments will test the viability of this method using respiratory inhibitors to determine specific parameters of mitochondrial function, which previously has not been attempted on terrestrial plant cells. Preparing for these experiments has included developing and maintaining <em>D. carota</em> and <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> liquid cell cultures and callus cultures, optimising cryopreservation protocols for <em>D. carota</em> cell cultures and developing a protocol for protoplast isolation. These species will be used to optimise methods to attempt the same with threatened species of native WA plants from the Kings Park tissue culture collection.</p>",10
3051,2021,"<p>According to ecological theory, sympatric species cannot occupy the same niche space. Therefore, the coexistence of sympatric species is thought to be facilitated by the partitioning of resources, differing patterns of habitat utilisation, or both. However, in the tropical savannas of northern Australia 3 sympatric grass finches co-exist. It is thought that the threatened Gouldian finch has a specialised diet of grass seeds and also morphological adaptations for greater dispersal.&nbsp;In contrast,&nbsp;the more common Long-tailed and Masked Finches have a generalist diet, including a greater range of herbaceous seeds and invertebrates, and are also more sedentary in their habitat use and movements. Fire regimes leading to increased movements to locate specialist food resources may increase risks to Gouldian finches, including starvation and/or lost body condition. This study uses stable isotope analysis and novel radio telemetry methods to test hypotheses on diet specialisation, and foraging behaviour in the Kimberley savanna as resource bottlenecks increase as grass seeds become more scarce into the late dry season.</p>
<p>Movement data using novel automated radio telemetry and VHF nanotags show that Gouldian finches respond to dry season declines in grass seed availability by spending less time at foraging sites and more time travelling between sites. Redetection rates using radio telemetry is high (92%) compared to only 1.7% using conventional waterhole counts. Core areas of finch activity correspond to areas frequently burnt in the early dry season. Statistical modelling will reveal the fire mosaics' relative importance compared to other environmental influences. Isotope analyses of finch blood and radio tracking revealed significant niche differentiation between co-occurring finches. Gouldian finches have a narrower dietary range and greater movements between foraging areas than the less specialised masked and longtail finches. Isotope analysis also revealed Gouldian finches have lower dietary nitrogen, supporting the hypothesis that they are more strictly granivorous.</p>",10
3084,2021,"<p>Anthropogenic loss and fragmentation of natural habitats has been increasing during the last 60 years and is now at unprecedented levels, making land use change one of the most important drivers affecting biodiversity. <em>Conospermum undulatum</em> is endemic to south-west Western Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. Significant reductions in population size, connectivity, area and floral display of remnant patches are likely to constrain the reproduction of this species by altered plant-pollinator interactions and expression of inbreeding depression because of reduced gene flow between unrelated individuals. This project will investigate the reproductive biology and genetic diversity in the species to inform recovery actions to enhance the future persistence of <em>C. undulatum </em>by means of an improved understanding of factors that constrain both its reproduction and its adaptation ability over the long-term.</p>
<p>The pollination study showed that cross-pollination by hand produced a ten-fold increase in seed production compared to natural pollination. Increased seed set using pollen sourced from different populations showed that small populations are producing approximately&nbsp;50 percent less seeds than they are able to produce via inter-population cross-breeding due to the combined effects of pollen limitation and reduction in compatible mate availability. Genetic analysis of populations using 19 microsatellite loci revealed weak genetic structure, and levels of genetic diversity and differentiation indices indicate high levels of gene flow prior to fragmentation. These results suggest that habitat fragmentation may result in patches that are too small and isolated to be attractive for pollinators and to allow long-term population viability based on reproduction by seed. Pollinator assessment showed <em>C. undulatum</em> has evolved pollen with resistance to the usually negative effect of ant secretions on pollen grains, with ants providing effective pollination services to this threatened species.

3243,2022,"<p>This project sought to establish relationships between satellite and field-based measurements of fire severity, focusing on three large bushfires that burned part of the Great Western Woodlands during December 2019-January 2020. The study utilised data from 113 field sites that were collected approximately one week and again thirteen months after the fires to capture the initial and more extended impacts, as well as early recovery post-fire. The field data spanned three broad vegetation structures including heath, woodland and mallee, which resembled regrowth woodland. The field severity metrics analysed in this study included estimated pre- and post-fire functional cover at three strata (bare surface cover, crown scorch at two strata), canopy death and resprouting live trees. Satellite spectral indices included the differenced normalised burn ratio (&Delta;NBR), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), relativised burn ratio (RBR) and i35 / Land Monitor. The strongest relationship was demonstrated between the overall field severity score and &Delta;NBR, particularly for heath and woodland vegetation types. Field measures of severity were regressed against the spectral indices as a single regression and faceted by vegetation type. Significant differences between vegetation types were found for ground, shrub and canopy cover, while bare surface cover showed differences over time. Initial canopy scorch did not appear to predict the degree of later canopy death or resprouting on live trees a year later. All analyses were conducted using R. Severity maps for the three fires and a report outlining the study context, methodology and results have been finalised.</p>",11
3083,2021,"<p><em>Reedia spathacea</em> (Cyperaceae) is a species of sedge found in the peat swamps of the Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographical regions. The growth habit is particular to the species, whereby it has apical meristems and above ground rhizomes protected by retained leaf sheaths with lateral roots that act as a means of clonal dispersal. Knowledge of morphology and reproductive strategy remain poorly known. The species is currently listed as critically endangered and it occurs in ecological communities that are threatened by feral pig damage, increased fire frequency, weed invasion, fluctuations in&nbsp;water quality and changes to land use, such as groundwater extraction and land clearing. This study aims to evaluate the morphology and ecology of the species and to determine its genetic structure and historical biogeography. Microsatellite DNA analyses will be used to determine population genetic structure of <em>R. spathacea</em> and chloroplast sequence data will be used to determine the evolutionary history.</p>
<p>Molecular clock dating with the chloroplast DNA markers <em>rbcL</em>, <em>trnL</em> and the <em>trnL-F</em> intron has provided strong evidence that the lineage <em>Reedia</em> is Gondwanan, and that <em>Reedia</em> itself diverged from its sister taxa during the increased aridification of the southern portion of the Australian continent approximately 20 million years ago. Haplotype networks of the chloroplast markers <em>psbE-petL</em> and <em>trnS-trnG-trnG</em> show little variation and shared haplotypes between populations. The microsatellite analyses detected 13 genetic groups among the 15 geographic populations sampled. Significant departure from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium was found across all populations indicating the presence of inbreeding, with no recent bottlenecks detected by either a sign or Wilcoxon sign-rank test for any population under any mutation model. Genetic differentiation between populations was moderately high and sexual reproduction appears to be more important to recruitment than clonality. This data indicates a previously more widespread and panmictic distribution for <em>Reedia </em>that has now become a series of isolated populations. The project has been completed and the thesis has been passed.</p>",10

3283,2022,"<p>Ecosystem resilience is the ability of an ecosystem to return to its former state following a disturbance, and is a key factor in evaluating the success of ecological restoration efforts. Resilience is difficult to measure and is unknown for many restored communities.

Investigations will assess resprouting capacity and soil seedbank dynamics across a chronosequence of ages between three and 27 years since restoration.</p>
<p>Responses to small scale burns conducted across the restoration chronosequence have been monitored at both ~6 months and 1 year post fire in the restoration chronosequence. A variety of factors including size, restoration age and soil compaction, was found to influence resprouting success. Regeneration capacity following fire exists across the chronosequence, with different rseponses in older compared to younger restoration. Exploration of soil seedbank dynamics following smoke treatment revealed strong potential for regeneration, with annuals associated with younger restoration and perennials with older restoration.</p>",11
3067,2021,"<p>The western swamp tortoise (<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>) is a threatened species listed as critically endangered. The species occurs in only two natural populations at very low numbers. Establishing new populations entirely with wild caught tortoises is not feasible and captive breeding provides a source of animals for supplementation of wild populations and establishment of new populations. Following a review of the diet of the captive-breeding colony of western swamp tortoises, a second manufactured diet based on white-fleshed fish was developed to address concerns about low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the 'traditional' red meat diet. For four years, approximately half the tortoises in the colony have been maintained on the original red-meat based diet and half on the white-fleshed fish diet. The project will determine whether there are any significant differences between the diets in hatchling and juvenile growth rates, weight loss associated with aestivation and female reproductive output (as determined by clutch size, egg mass and hatchling mass).&nbsp;</p>

3029,2021,"<p>Coral predators, such as the corallivorous gastropod, <em>Drupella cornus</em>, pose a threat to coral communities depending on their abundance and distribution. In recent years, feeding aggregations of <em>Drupella</em> have been reported in subtropical coral communities at Rottnest Island for the first time. This could negatively impact coral communities, particularly following thermal stress events, as <em>Drupella</em> species aggregate on stressed coral.

3313,2022,"<p>Arboreal nest box camera studies suggest that the greatest benefit of using nest boxes in augmenting nesting sites is gained in intermediate savanna and forest habitats where large tree and hollow density is medium. Arboreal species overlap in their hollow and tree use; however the brush tailed rabbit rat builds dens closer to the ground in dead trees and hollow logs, and forages at ground level. This makes them more susceptible to terrestrial threatening processes (fire, feral cats, cattle and buffalo) compared to larger, more arboreal species including black footed tree rat, brush tailed possum and savanna gliders.</p>
<p>Arboreal mammals in savannas have differing tree hollow preferences based on camera trap and radio tracking data, with the brush-tailed rabbit-rats preferring smaller hollows in standing dead timber and closer to the ground. Brush-tailed possums and black-footed tree-rats prefer large hollows high in the canopy, and savanna gliders have much broader hollow tolerance. Arboreal species overlapped in their use of hollows, with multiple individuals and species sharing them with birds and arboreal predators including tree snakes and goannas. Despite this, on densely forested Melville Island, ground layer factors including presence of feral cats, shrub and fruiting plant density were the dominant influences on arboreal mammal abundance rather than hollow density or related arboreal habitat. Perhaps unlike mainland savannas, tree hollows on Melville are at higher densities and are therefore less limiting on arboreal species abundance.</p>

Early results indicated suitable food availability as a key component. The aims are to 1) develop novel environmental DNA methods to understand diet in new habitats; 2) document foraging behaviour in relation to water temperatures and prey availability; 3) link metabolic processes and food intake to predict long-term growth rates and reproduction in new environments.

3047,2021,"<p>Salt lakes are a distinctive feature of Western Australian inland areas. Several invertebrate groups appear to be far more diverse in Western Australia than anywhere else in Australia and even globally, probably reflecting the long history of aridification and the now disjunct occurrence of this type of wetland in the State.

The first goal of the project is to use mitochondrial DNA data and, if necessary, nuclear DNA data, to assess the validity of the morpho-taxonomy of genus <em>Australocypris</em>, which is one of the most diverse genera in Australian salt lakes. The second goal is to use molecular data to test alternative hypotheses about species radiations in <em>Australocypris</em>, whose evolutionary history is largely unknown.

3516,2023,"<p>Salt lakes are an iconic feature of Western Australian semi-arid and arid landscapes. Western Australia has a particularly diverse halophilic fauna. Salt lakes and their biota are threatened by altered hydrological processes and changes in water quality associated with land clearing and, increasingly, by mining. One of the most intriguing invertebrate groups is the snail genus <em>Coxiella</em>, which tolerates periodic drying and high salinities and is the only mollusc occurring in temporarily filled salt lakes. This project focusses on the phylogenetics, phylogeography and physiology of this genus.</p>
<p>A taxonomic assessment of <em>Coxiella</em> has identified 14 species, with 6 considered to be new. This study also included <em>Tomichia </em>from South Africa&nbsp;and <em>Idiopyrgus </em>from South America and confirmed that these plus <em>Coxiella</em> form a family with Gondwanan origins. The phylogeographic study suggested diversification of <em>Coxiella</em> began during the early to mid-Miocene, followed by speciation during the mid to late Miocene and diversification within species during the Pliocene/Pleistocene. Analyses indicated that phylogeographic structure and genetic diversity vary according to biogeography and climatic history. Species exhibited two broad patterns consistent with their distributions in relation to rainfall. Results of salinity tolerance experiments suggested that all&nbsp;<em>Coxiella </em>species can persist across a wide range of salinities (at least 5 &ndash; 90 mS/cm) but upper limits vary between species. <em>Coxiella </em>n. sp 2, in particular, was able to tolerate ~ 135 mS/cm, suggesting that this species may be one of the most salt tolerant gastropods globally.</p>",12
3257,2022,"<p>The Australasian bittern (<em>Botaurus poiciloptilus</em>) is listed as endangered in Western Australia. Once widespread in south-western Australia, it is now known from a small number of near coastal sedge/reed dominated wetlands from the Swan Coastal Plain to just east of Esperance, with breeding known from a subset of these. It is thought that fewer than 150 individuals inhabit these wetlands but there is little reliable data on population size and composition.

An action in the plan is to ""d<span dir=""ltr"">evelop and implement an Australasian bittern population </span><span dir=""ltr"">monitoring program"". Monitoring for this species is time consuming and challenging because of its cryptic nature and rarity. Genetic methods have the potential to assist with local and regional population estimates, understanding how bitterns move across their range, and population monitoring. This project aimed to investigate the potential for extracting and analysing DNA from shed feathers.</span></p>
<p>Protocols were developed to extract DNA from a number of feathers collected in recent years by DBCA and Birdlife Australia. Bittern DNA has been obtained from some feathers but the sample size and rate of success has been low. Extractions were more successful (all four feathers) for feathers shed by a bird while being fitted with a satellite tracking device. Amplification and sequencing of CO1 DNA confirmed the DNA came from that species. It is unclear whether this increased success is due to the freshness of the feathers or improved handling and storage. Further research into new shed feathers with optimal storage and handling techniques would be needed to determine this, but results suggest that feathers could potentially provide insights into population size and movements of this species. Given the poor results from the older feathers, a second component to this project was undertaken, examining population genetics of a species of <em>Coxiella</em> snails. This was completed and showed populations of <em>Coxiella striatula</em> inhabiting near coastal salt lakes around the south-west of WA were dominated by two haplotypes and suggested a recent genetic bottleneck.</p>",11
3519,2023,"<p>According to ecological theory, sympatric species cannot occupy the same niche space. Therefore, the coexistence of sympatric species is thought to be facilitated by the partitioning of resources, differing patterns of habitat utilisation, or both. However, in the tropical savannas of northern Australia 3 sympatric grass finches co-exist. It is thought that the threatened Gouldian finch has a specialised diet of grass seeds and also morphological adaptations for greater dispersal. In contrast, the more common Long-tailed and Masked Finches have a generalist diet, including a greater range of herbaceous seeds and invertebrates, and are also more sedentary in their habitat use and movements. Fire regimes leading to increased movements to locate specialist food resources may increase risks to Gouldian finches, including starvation and/or lost body condition. This study uses stable isotope analysis and novel radio telemetry methods to test hypotheses on diet specialisation, and foraging behaviour in the Kimberley savanna as resource bottlenecks increase as grass seeds become more scarce into the late dry season.</p>
<p>Analyses showed that Gouldian finches visited waterholes less often per day than other finches, leading to over-estimations of some species. Consistent with predictions based on wing length/diet, Gouldian finches dispersed more, and spent less time at foraging sites as seed density declined through the dry season. Masked and long-tailed finches changed diet instead of increasing searches for grass seeds. Gouldian finches preferentially foraged where prescribed burning had occurred, and grass seeds were denser. Late dry season and wet season burnt, and long unburnt habitats were not selected by finches. Two papers were published, another has been accepted and two draft papers are in development.</p>",12

3280,2022,"<p>Salt lakes are a distinctive feature of Western Australian inland areas. Several invertebrate groups appear to be far more diverse in Western Australia than anywhere else in Australia and even globally, probably reflecting the long history of aridification and the now disjunct occurrence of this type of wetland in the State.

Perth Zoo, along with all major zoos in Australia, are involved in a regional breeding program for Sumatran tigers. This project aimed to develop and refine non-invasive assessment methods of tiger welfare and determine their effectiveness. To determine the factors most influential to captive tiger welfare there is a need to develop better tools with which to measure their welfare. A variety of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were used to quantify faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) as biomarkers of physiological stress.</p>
<p>An EIA for tiger FGMs that was both highly sensitive and robust, allowing for the accurate analysis of FGMs in tiger faeces even after short term exposure to the elements, was used for longitudinal analysis. Faecal samples (1&ndash;2 per week) were collected from seven Sumatran tigers in three zoos around Australia for over a year. Australian temperate climates influenced Sumatran tiger FGMs as the seasons changed, with seasons most similar to that of the tropical, less changeable, Sumatran climate predicting the lowest FGM concentrations. Of particular importance was the amount of precipitation, with rainier seasons correlating with lower FGM concentrations. Furthermore, cold weather appeared to be more likely to coincide with a physiological stress response in tigers. An observational study at a facility that housed 12 tigers (the single largest collection in Australia at the time) showed that the greatest predictor of low pacing prevalence was the presence of olfactory cues from conspecifics, followed by the presence of a pool, with the effects being greater for larger pools than smaller ones. Additionally, tigers in oestrus and those exposed to the scent of a tiger in oestrus further increased their patrolling, but when in smaller and less complex enclosures it also caused an increase in pacing. The results lead to several management suggestions regarding the ways in which water and olfactory enrichment could be used to improve captive tiger welfare.</p>",11

A glasshouse cross pollination study of <em>Schoenia filifolia</em> to evaluate whether the genetic composition of the founder populations contributes to translocation success has been completed and a paper describing this work has been published in <em>Australian Journal of Botany</em>.</p>",12
3241,2022,"<p>Aerial survey is a standard technique used in wildlife management to estimate population abundance and detect trends.&nbsp; It is particularly useful for species with&nbsp;large ranges and broad distribution patterns, such as marine mammals, as the technique allows relatively large areas to be covered over short periods of time. While aerial surveys are typically designed for specific target species, additional species are often recorded as surveys are generally infrequent due to expense and logistical constraints. Analyses to estimate abundance of non-target species recorded during surveys can have limitations as information recorded for these species may be constrained or incomplete. In this study, analysis of aerial survey data collected in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, will be extended beyond the target species (dolphins) and applied to humpback whale (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) abundance estimation. While the survey was designed for distance sampling abundance estimation of dolphins, a strip transect approach was taken for humpback whales, and a maximum strip width was not defined. This study will evaluate various strip width estimates derived from the detection functions of comparable cues and a field based trial. &nbsp;An absolute abundance estimate for humpback whales will be calculated using strip-transect based methods, with corrections for availability and perception bias. The methods used here will be evaluated through comparison of these estimates with those derived from photographs taken during the survey, which have a known strip width. The relative density distribution of the species within the area will also be mapped and evaluated. The results of this study will update current knowledge on the abundance and distribution of key marine mammals with a focus on humpback whales in Exmouth Gulf, to inform ongoing monitoring and management of this &lsquo;conservation dependant' population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research proposal for this project has been approved and processing of image and aerial survey data relevant to humpback whales has begun.</p>",11
3509,2023,"<p>Robust population estimates are fundamental to species conservation and management. This project aims to use lured remote sensor cameras and spatially-explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modelling to improve the accuracy of density estimates for chuditch populations.</p>
<p>Spatial distribution of cameras was investigated for chuditch. Results suggested the use of paired cameras set horizontally at 30 cm off the ground with a grid of spacing of 1 km between sites. Comparing two spatial layouts, a grid and a road array, showed that while both layouts produced similar density estimates, but the grid was more reliable. To test the broadscale suitability of a 1 km grid, cameras were deployed in three additional locations: Dryandra National Park, Batalling State Forest and Moopinup Forest Block, and in Julimar to detect changes in chuditch detections over time. Via simulation, the reliability of the density estimates from these deployments are being used to determine adjustments to location-specific surveys to improve reliability.</p>",12
3504,2023,"<p>This project aims to examine the effects of cryopreservation on metabolism of plant tissues, with emphasis on mitochondrial function as these organelles are the primary sources of energy molecules (ATP) that drive all cellular processes including the ability to recover from injury sustained to cells and tissues during the various steps of cryopreservation. A better understanding of the effects of cryogenic injury will enable better optimisation of cryopreservation for sensitive species, including many threatened taxa where ex situ storage remains a problem.</p>
<p>Trials measuring oxygen consumption of Daucus carota cells on the Seahorse XF analyser identified that certain cryoprotective agents show a significant negative effect on mitochondrial function. This work was presented at the IV International Symposium on Plant Cryopreservation. Further experiments on the viability of the Seahorse method using respiratory inhibitors to determine the specific parameters of mitochondrial function affected are in progress. The study species will be used to optimise methods for application to threatened species of native WA plants from the Kings Park tissue culture collection.</p>",12
3370,2023,"<p>This project is investigating how the wave height, energy and erosive power at the eastern shoreline of Pelican Point is being influenced by bathymetry, storm surges, wind waves and boat wakes.</p>
<p>Eight pressure loggers deployed in nearshore and offshore areas between December 2022 and June 2023 have been retrieved and downloaded. Available datasets have been analysed to identify durations of significant storm surges and boat wakes, as well as durations for wave energy attenuation investigation. Matlab routine&nbsp;for calculating wave properties including wave energy has been created. Next steps include finalizing the wave attenuation dataset, applying appropriate time periods for analysis of durations of storms surges and boat wakes, and calculation of wave energy using wave by wave analysis.&nbsp;</p>",12
3506,2023,"<p>This project examines the effects of oxidative stress on cryopreserved plant material, using the model species <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, including mutant variants with reduced antioxidant contents. Oxidative stress is a primary impediment to successful cryopreservation of plant material, and a better understanding of this will be a crucial step forward in designing more efficient cryopreservation protocols for ex-situ conservation of threatened plant species.</p>
<p>An optimised cryopreservation method for wild type <em>A. thaliana</em> has been developed using vitamin C- and GSH-deficient mutant plants (vtc2-1, vtc2-4, pad2-1 and cad2), to assess changes in transcriptome using RNA-seq. Assessments of the transcriptome, gene expression by RT-qPRC, oxidized DNA damage and antioxidant contents have been completed to understand the stresses imposed by cryopreservation. All experiments are completed and writing is underway.</p>",12
3491,2023,"<p>Submerged macrophytes play a fundamental role in the functioning of freshwater lakes and rivers providing food, refugia, shade and influencing physico-chemical conditions. A submerged macrophyte community has been an important part of the Canning River Kent Street Weir Pool (KSW) for decades. Recent observations suggest it has disappeared from the weir pool. This project aims to determine the changes in water quality in the weir pool over the last 20 years, determine the historical extent of submerged macrophytes in the weir and investigate reasons for their changes in abundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This research has confirmed that there was no submerged macrophyte community in the KSW and determined that it had been consistently absent since 2017. Changes in light levels, influenced by management of the upgraded weir, were suggested as the likely cause of macrophyte loss. A journal article is in development.</p>",12
