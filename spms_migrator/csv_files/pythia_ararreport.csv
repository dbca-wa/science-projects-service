1,1,4,2014-06-05 20:38:02.713000+10:00,2014-11-17 12:24:49.613000+11:00,2014,"There has been much change since we became the Department of Parks and Wildlife in July 2013, with renewed focus on conservation of Western Australia's unique plants and animals and our world-class network of parks, reserves and natural areas. Our Strategic Directions for 2013-14 recognised that science and research play a critical role in effective management of species and ecosystems.

In October 2013 the Science Division was amalgamated with the Nature Conservation Division providing new opportunities for science to more directly inform conservation policy and management, and for management requirements and knowledge gaps to set research priorities.

While much of our work supports the conservation priorities of the Wildlife corporate goal, we also provide scientific research and information to support delivery of the Parks, Fire, Managed Use and People corporate goals. The combined responsibilities of the divisions are focused around two main areas of Species conservation and Landscape conservation. Our work in species conservation involves activities, such as species and community recovery, wildlife protection and licensing, understanding species biology and taxonomy, while our landscape conservation work is focused on landscape and seascape management, development advice and liaison, understanding ecosystem processes and biological survey. Information systems and monitoring and evaluation link across both species and landscape conservation activities. Across all areas, effective exchange of knowledge and information to support legislation and policy is fundamental to effective delivery of wildlife management outcomes.

Partnerships have always been an important means of achieving our outcomes. In delivering against the priorities encapsulated in the corporate goals we continue to work with other Divisions, particularly Forest and Ecosystem Management, Parks and Visitor Services, Regional and Fire Management Services and Public Information and Corporate Affairs. We also seek to engage with our partners, including other research institutions, industry, Aboriginal people, the community and other government agencies.

In addition to broader structural change, there has been some internal restructure leading to several changes to science program structures and names, to reflect the broader context of the new Division. The Fauna Conservation and Flora Conservation and Herbarium programs are now known as the Animal Science Program and the Plant Science and Herbarium Programs, and the Landscape Conservation program is known as the Ecosystems Science Program. The Science Applications Program is now called the Ecoinformatics program due to its focus on informatics for ecological systems.

The hydrology and recovery catchment work undertaken in the former Nature Conservation Division has been combined with the wetlands survey and monitoring undertaken in Science Division to form the Wetlands Conservation Program. Adrian Pinder was appointed as Program Leader and is developing an integrated approach to biological and hydrological wetland science. Revegetation systems research is winding down with the completion of the Future Farm Industries Co-operative Research Centre. The work in this area that was undertaken in the Natural Resources Branch in the former Nature Conservation Division has been integrated with other revegetation research undertaken in the Ecosystem Science Program.

We decided to disband the Biodiversity and Climate change Unit, which was set up in 2008 as a cross program unit to provide a focus for climate change research. Climate change is now integrated into much of the research work across the programs and there is no longer a need to have a specific focus on it, as it is one of many threatening processes.

There have also been more recent changes to programs since 2013-14 with Dr Lesley Gibson appointed as Program Leader of the Biogeography Program and Dr Alan Kendrick appointed as Program Leader of the Marine Science Program. Dr Stephen van Leeuwen has relinquished the Biogeography Program Leader role to focus on an expanded role as Partnerships Manager for the Science and Conservation Division. This includes a focus on engagement with aboriginal people, particularly in the context of amendments to the CALM Act and the requirements for the department to enter into joint management arrangements.

This report provides accountability for the research activity undertaken in the Science and Conservation Division and is based on a level of technical content to provide that accountability. We recognise the importance of effective communication of the outcomes of our research, particularly in ensuring the results inform conservation policy and wildlife and forest management practice. Therefore, this year we have also produced a series of non-technical publications that describe the science we are undertaking in each of the regions of the Department. These 'Science in the Regions' publications summarise the science activities we are undertaking to support conservation and wildlife management in each region. They are available on the website along with a copy of this report.

I look forward to continuing to work effectively with all our partners in delivery of our core objectives to provide effective science to inform conservation and management of our plants, animals and ecosystems, and to support effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program, managed use of our natural resources and science stories that inspire and engage people with our natural heritage.

We have continued to implement our Strategic Plan to integrate science into the delivery of the Department's strategic goals of wildlife management, parks management, forest management, and managed use of natural assets. Our resources and activities are aligned with our core functions to ensure we are delivering best practice science driven by management priorities to inform effective conservation.</p>
<p>Through 2015-16 we continued our work in the core areas of conserving threatened plant, animals and communities, landscape scale conservation, wildlife assets and inventory, WA Herbarium, bushfire research, marine monitoring and research, forest monitoring and research, wetland monitoring, hydrological monitoring, and data management and distribution. Some highlights of activities this year have been the launch of books documenting the outcomes of the Kimberley Islands Survey and the Pilbara Biological Survey; development of a Population Viability Analysis for Carnaby's cockatoo; knowledge to support recovery actions for threatened animals, birds and plants affected by the severe fires along the south coast in 2015; establishing a survey database to ensure effective management of plot based data; review of the marine monitoring program to direct resources to the most effective outcomes and rationalise the reporting framework; and reconstruction of the major fires affecting WA in the past twelve months.</p>
<p>Support for Biodiversity and Marine Science as one of the State Government's five science priorities continues. The Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI) was launched by the Premier in October 2015 as a joint venture between nine founding partners, including the Department of Parks and Wildlife. The Governing council and Board are guiding its establishment, with an Executive Director in place and two Node Leaders appointed for the Biodiversity Survey, and Biodiversity Processes and Threats Nodes. Node Leaders for the Information Management, and Restoration and Ex-situ Conservation Nodes are being sought. I look forward to engagement of the Division in all of the nodes as the institute develops and with all relevant partners in delivering the agreed research plan for each node.</p>
<p>Our partnership with WAMSI continues and many projects under the Kimberley Marine Research program are now in the knowledge exchange phase. A series of seminars and meetings with managers and end-users were delivered to help understand the implications of the research outputs for marine park management.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to see major engagement of divisional staff with three hubs of the National Environmental Science Program (NESP), the Threatened Species Hub, the Northern Australian Environmental Resources Hub and the Marine Science Hub. The NESP hubs are strongly aligned with our own objectives as they seek to deliver applied research to support on-ground management; hence the involvement of our staff provides a key perspective on the application of excellent science to address conservation and management issues.</p>
<p>This year has seen a national focus on threatened species following the Threatened Species Summit where the Threatened Species Commissioner released the Threatened Species Strategy. Many of the target species for the strategy are found in Western Australia and our research on the biology and ecology of these species and their threats is critical to making a difference in conservation management outcomes. Many of our scientists were involved in the Threatened Species Forum coordinated by the Northern Agricultural Catchment Council and held in Geraldton to highlight the conservation management of threatened species in Western Australia.</p>
<p>As we continue to deliver excellent science to underpin effective biodiversity conservation in Western Australia, I encourage you all to make the most of opportunities and continue to seek innovative ways of delivering science to support the Department's core functions.</p>
<p>I welcome our continued engagement with all our partners, both within the Department and externally, in the delivery of innovative science to inform conservation and management of our plants, animals and ecosystems, and to support effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire&nbsp;program, managed use of our natural resources and science stories that inspire and engage people to embrace our natural heritage.</p>","<p>Abbott I (2016).

These challenges presented the opportunity to review our activities to focus on the core functions we are required to deliver to support government priorities. Our Strategic Plan identifies how our science is integrated into delivery of the Department&rsquo;s strategic goals of wildlife management, parks management, forest management, and managed use of natural assets.</p>
<p>In reviewing our business we articulated our core functions as conserving threatened plant, animals and communities, landscape scale conservation, wildlife assets and inventory, WA Herbarium, bushfire research, marine monitoring and research, forest monitoring and research, wetland monitoring, hydrological monitoring, and data management and distribution. We have aligned our resources with these functions and refocused our activities to ensure we are delivering best practice science driven by management priorities to inform effective wildlife conservation and parks management.</p>
<p>Through all of this we have continued to deliver significant scientific information to support conservation of our diverse plants, animals and ecological communities. Highlights of activities this year include publication of a book documenting the outcomes of the Kimberley Islands Biological Survey; documenting the response of mammals to the establishment of a patchy early dry season burning regime in the Kimberley; development of genetic monitoring techniques for bilbies; registration of the cat bait, <em>Eradicat</em>&reg;, for operational use after many years of research; significant reduction in cats on Dirk Hartog Island following baiting; production of a book on algae of the north-west waters; production of a fire spread model for coastal scrublands of the south-west; revision of the fire behaviour ratings for communities in the Great Western Woodlands; increased understanding of effects of climate change and adaptation in coral reef communities, widespread eucalypts and in seed germination; addition of the 10,000<sup>th </sup>plant species to the WA census and description of 35 new plant species; maintenance of genetic diversity in seed collections from populations now extinct due to impacts of <em>Phytophthora</em>; understanding of seed collection zones for south-west forest rehabilitation and land restoration in the mid-west; establishment of an innovative citizen science program to monitor little penguins and visitor access to Penguin Island.</p>
<p>A Science Statement for Western Australia was released in April and it is pleasing to see that Biodiversity and Marine Science is one of the five science priorities for Western Australia, along with mining and energy, medicine and health, agriculture and food, and radio astronomy. The Science Statement announced State Government support for establishment of the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute (WABSI), a joint venture between nine partners including Department of Parks and Wildlife, Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, WA Museum, CSIRO, The University of Western Australia, Murdoch University, Curtin University, Department of Mines and Petroleum and Office of the Environmental Protection Authority. Several other partners have been members of the Steering Committee guiding the development of WABSI, including BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group, and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy, under the leadership of Professor Alan Robson. WABSI will have a Governing Council and a Board to guide its operations, and with support for the governance and administrative operations from the State Government. It will be organised around four nodes of Information Management, Biodiversity Survey, Biodiversity Processes and Threats, and Restoration and Ex-situ conservation, with node leaders responsible for engaging all relevant partners in delivering the agreed research plan for each node. I look forward to engagement of the Division in all of the nodes as the institute develops.</p>
<p>Our partnership with Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI) continues with projects fully operational and starting to deliver outcomes. The WAMSI conference held in April highlighted the wide range of projects being delivered through the Dredging Science Node and the Kimberley Marine Research Program. The Blueprint for Marine Science was also released and implementation will be further developed through the Premier&rsquo;s Round Table process.</p>
<p>Another major development in the past year has been the funding of the National Environmental Science Program (NESP) and we have significant involvement in three hubs, the Threatened Species Hub, the Northern Australian Environment Hub and the Marine Science Hub. The NESP hubs are strongly aligned with our own objectives as they are seeking to deliver applied research to support on-ground management; hence we have a significant role to play in these hubs through our integrated and highly applied research function. I encourage you all to be involved in the hubs where relevant.</p>
<p>In April, we hosted a visit by delegates from the Institute of Botany-Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences.&nbsp; This visit followed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the WA Government and the Jiangsu Institute, aimed at the development of joint programs that build on shared interests and research strengths, including participation in an international exchange of seeds, plants and specimens.&nbsp; Similarly, we welcomed a visit by the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Threatened Species Commissioner to enhance collaborations and improve awareness of the opportunities for investment in threatened species research and management in WA.</p>
<p>We continue to maintain excellent partnerships with universities, CSIRO, industry, not-for-profit-organisations and other government agencies with many new projects and a large number of students that we co-supervise.</p>
<p>As we consolidate after some major change over the past two years, I am confident we will continue to deliver excellent science to underpin effective biodiversity conservation in Western Australia. I encourage you all to make the most of all opportunities and continue to seek innovative ways of delivering science to support conservation. Our engagement with the conservation function continues to deliver excellent outcomes as we integrate our science expertise with our conservation policy capacity, enabling our science to more directly inform conservation policy and management, and for management requirements and knowledge gaps to set our research priorities. Our engagement with regional staff and with staff from Forest and Ecosystem Management and Parks and Visitor Services Divisions is critical to implementation of effective science to support the department&rsquo;s core functions.</p>
<p>I look forward to continued engagement with all our partners, both within the Department and externally, in delivery of innovative science to inform conservation and management of our plants, animals and ecosystems, and to support effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program, managed use of our natural resources and science stories that inspire and engage people to explore and appreciate our natural heritage.</p>","<p>Abbott I, Peacock D, Short J (2014) The new guard: the arrival and impacts of cats and foxes.

<p>The science function (shaded in structure diagram) of the Science and Conservation Division is integrated with policy and management functions reflecting the vital role of science and information in effectively managing Western Australia&rsquo;s plants, animals and ecosystems, and in the sustainable development of the State.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge forms a framework for engagement with the community in appreciating our natural places and with Aboriginal people on Country.</p>
<p>Western Australia is a large state with unique biological diversity and the explicit knowledge required to manage Western Australia&rsquo;s unique environments requires local expertise. Parks and Wildlife&rsquo;s internal research capacity is extended and leveraged through attracting external investment to address Departmental priorities, and through strategic collaborations and partnerships.</p>",,,,,,,,,,
6,1,6,2017-05-29 15:39:18.584457+10:00,2017-10-10 15:46:17.149157+11:00,2017,"<p>Through 2016-17 we continued to provide an effective science service to support the Department of Parks and Wildlife's corporate goals of wildlife management, parks management, forest management and managed use of natural assets. In supporting these core functions, we delivered best practice science to inform conservation and management of our plants, animals and ecosystems, and to support effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and managed use of our natural resources, as well as generating science stories that inspire and engage people with our natural heritage.</p>
<p>Our activities are aligned with management priorities and we deliver science expertise in our core areas of conserving threatened plants, animals and communities, landscape scale conservation, wildlife assets and inventory, WA Herbarium, bushfire research, marine monitoring and research, forest monitoring and research, wetland monitoring, hydrological monitoring, and biodiversity data management and distribution<em>. </em>Some highlights of activities this year have been lack of detection of cats on Dirk Hartog Island, translocation of rock wallabies to Kalbarri National Park and dibblers to Gunton Island, establishment of a flatback turtle monitoring program on Thevenard Island and aerial surveys of turtle nesting on beaches in the Pilbara, surveys for bilbies and rare plants in the La Grange development area of the Kimberley, vertebrate survey in the northern part of the Matuwa Kurrara Kurrara Indigenous Protected Area with traditional owners, determining meteorological drivers of extreme fire behaviour during the Waroona bushfire, and monitoring on FORESTCHECK sites burnt in the Lower Hotham bushfire. In addition, the excellence of our science and its application in management was recognised by <em>Western Shield</em> winning the Premier&rsquo;s Award for Excellence in Public Sector Management in the managing the environment category.</p>
<p>I am very pleased that we continue to be key partners in the Western Australian Marine Science Institution and the Western Australian Biodiversity Science Institute. Although these joint ventures are at different stages in their funding cycles, we continue to make significant contributions to their programs, and gain substantial benefit from our engagement in these initiatives.</p>
<p>I am also very pleased to have continued engagement with the National Environmental Science Program (NESP) hubs, as our staff provide a key perspective on the application of excellent science to address conservation and management needs. In particular, programs of the Threatened Species Recovery hub and the Northern Australia Environmental Resources hub are strongly aligned with those of our department in delivering applied science and research outcomes to support on-ground management.</p>
<p>Engagement with all our partners, both within the Department and externally, is an important component of how we deliver best practice science, and we continue to maintain excellent partnerships with universities, CSIRO, industry, not-for-profit organisations and other government agencies with many new projects and a large number of students that we co-supervise. We continue to build our relationship and engagement with traditional owners through research activities in the Pilbara, Western Desert and Kimberley</p>
<p>This report will be our last report as the Department of Parks and Wildlife. From 1 July 2017 Parks and Wildlife was amalgamated with Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, Zoological Parks Authority and Rottnest Island Authority to become the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. A key function of the new department is to consolidate conservation science into one department to build and share knowledge of WA's biodiversity. I am confident we will continue to deliver excellence in applied science to support the core functions of the new department as we embrace the challenges and take advantage of the new opportunities provided by the amalgamation of these agencies.</p>","<p>Abbott I, Wills A (2016).

The science function (shaded in structure diagram) of Science and Conservation is integrated with policy and management functions reflecting the vital role of science and information in effectively managing Western Australia&rsquo;s plants, animals and ecosystems, and in the sustainable development of the State. Scientific knowledge forms a framework for engagement with the community in appreciating our natural places and with Aboriginal people on Country. Western Australia is a large state with unique biological diversity and the explicit knowledge required to manage Western Australia&rsquo;s unique environments requires local expertise. Parks and Wildlife&rsquo;s internal research capacity is extended and leveraged through attracting external investment to address Departmental priorities, and through strategic collaborations and partnerships.</span></span></p>",ararreports/6/SDSBanner2_3.jpg,ararreports/6/ScienceandConservationDivisionstructure2017.jpg,ararreports/6/Summaryofresearch.jpg,ararreports/6/ExternalCollaboration.jpg,ararreports/6/StudentProjects.jpg,ararreports/6/Bibliography.jpg,ararreports/6/AcademiaV2.jpg,,,
7,1,100564,2018-07-03 14:23:44.501256+10:00,2019-01-31 11:44:00.724667+11:00,2018,"<p>I am pleased to present our first research report as the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. On 1 July 2017, the Department of Parks and Wildlife was amalgamated with the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, Zoological Parks Authority and Rottnest Island Authority. A key focus area for the new department, as identified by the State Government, is to combine biodiversity science into one department to build and share biodiversity knowledge. In that context, the science functions of the previous agencies have been combined in Biodiversity and Conservation Science and this report reflects the activities and outcomes of the science work of the new department for the past financial year.</p>
<p>In forming Biodiversity and Conservation Science to provide science services to the whole of the department, we have established a new structure. Along with continuing the existing programs of Animal Science, Plant Science and Herbarium, Marine Science, Ecoinformatics, and Species and Communities, we have formed new programs in Fire Science, Kings Park Science, Perth Zoo Science, Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis, and Rivers and Estuaries Science. The work undertaken in the previous Wetlands Conservation Program and the Biogeography Program has joined forestry research in the Ecosystem Science Program. A Biodiversity and Conservation Science Forum held in May showcased the diversity and high quality of science delivered by Biodiversity and Conservation Science, and provided an opportunity for staff and affiliated students to learn about the science projects undertaken.</p>
<p>A key activity this year has been to prepare a Science Strategic Plan for the department. Development of the plan drew on the knowledge and expertise of a range of departmental staff from science, operations, management and policy, to determine the key direction for science to support the policy and operational conservation management functions of the department. The plan was endorsed by Corporate Executive in June and was launched by the Chief Scientist, Professor Peter Klinken, in August. The plan articulates the key objectives of science against five of the six strategic intent statements for the department: Biodiversity and Conservation, Fire Management, Natural and Cultural Values, Our Community and Partners, and Our People. The science plan also links with state science priorities, as Biodiversity and Marine Science is identified in <em>A Science Statement for Western Australia</em> as a priority area for science in Western Australia where scientific knowledge is essential to ensure we conserve, appreciate and value add to the unique biodiversity found around us.</p>
<p>Throughout the changes and development of the strategic plan we have maintained our scientific research activity and outputs. Highlights for this year include a pilot translocation of hare wallabies to Dirk Hartog Island given the success in goat and cat eradication programs, the launch of the Banksia Woodlands Restoration book that is a culmination of many years research into restoration of Banksia Woodlands by scientists from Kings Park, flora translocation for species identified as a priority in the national Threatened Species Strategy, the completion of targeted surveys for rare flora and bilbies in the La Grange Irrigated Agriculture project area in the west Kimberley, and the discovery in Roebuck Bay of the first consistently used foraging area for flatback turtles.&nbsp; Species and Communities Branch staff have also provided considerable input to the drafting of Regulations to support the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>. Most of our projects have been undertaken in partnership with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and from Perth Zoo and Kings Park, and with fantastic assistance from our volunteers.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to consolidate our new structure and furthering the delivery of excellence in applied science to support the conservation management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems for the benefit of all Western Australians. We will have an ongoing focus on partnerships and will strive to build additional relationships with universities, the resources sector, aboriginal land managers and NGOs.&nbsp; We also have a renewed focus on science communication and looking for new ways to share inspiring stories and connect people with our fascinating plants and animals and our unique natural places is a key objective.</p>","<p>Ahrens C, Byrne M, Rymer P (2017).

<p>Science in the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions is undertaken in accordance with the departmental Science Policy, where science refers to scientific research, scientific monitoring and science communication undertaken in relation to the biological, physical and social environments.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science coordinates and delivers science in the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, providing science and biodiversity knowledge to support the functions of the Parks and Wildlife Service, Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, Zoological Parks Authority and Rottnest Island Authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science is structured into programs focused on key themes for the delivery of targeted science to support evidence-based decision making and the conservation and land management functions of the department. Science and research is undertaken using both Western Australian Government and external funding sources.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science operates from a range of locations including Kensington, Kings Park, Perth Zoo, Woodvale, Manjimup, Bunbury, Busselton, Kununurra, and Albany, and includes the Western Australian Herbarium.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science staff have expertise in animal biology, animal breeding, aquatic ecology, biological survey, collections management, conservation biotechnology, conservation genetics, conservation medicine, conservation policy, ecology, ecological restoration, ecoinformatics, ecophysiology, fire behaviour, hydrology, marine biology, plant biology, remote sensing and spatial analysis, seed biology, systematics and taxonomy.</p>",ararreports/7/Servicedeliverystructure.jpg,,ararreports/7/Summaryofresearchprojects.JPG,ararreports/7/partnershipscropped.jpeg,ararreports/7/Studentprojectreports.jpg,ararreports/7/Publicationsandreports_1.jpg,ararreports/7/Studentprojects.jpg,,,
11,1,101073,2022-07-01 15:28:49.270593+10:00,2023-10-03 19:06:15.634586+11:00,2022,"<p>I am pleased to present our Biodiversity and Conservation Science report for 2021-22 as we continue deliver on the government&rsquo;s commitment to build and share biodiversity knowledge for Western Australia. This is achieved through world-class applied science that informs conservation and management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>
<p>We came together as Biodiversity and Conservation Science in 2018 and the science we have undertaken over the past four years has delivered excellent outcomes against the priorities identified in the Science Strategic Plan 2018-2021. These outcomes have been collated in a Report available on the department&rsquo;s website. A new Science Strategic Plan 2022-2025 has been produced and this articulates the outcomes science will deliver to achieve the Department&rsquo;s Strategic Directions 2022-2025. The Plan guides the work we do in Biodiversity and Conservation Science to continue to deliver scientific excellence to support biodiversity conservation.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science provides innovative science through the technical expertise and capability of our science staff and the excellent support of our administration staff. Once again, our staff have shown their professionalism in the face of ongoing challenges, and I am enormously proud of the Biodiversity and Conservation Science team and what we achieve together and with our partners.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, we continue to be highly productive. A major achievement this year has been the launch of the biodiversity data platform, Dandjoo, through the work of the Biodiversity Information Office. This initiative is a State Commonwealth partnership to collate, curate and make available biodiversity data to support environmental management and conservation in Western Australia. Science staff have provided a large amount of scientific information and expertise to support development of the new Forest Management Plan 2024-2033. Other highlights of our scientific endeavours include survey of plastics in the Swan Canning Estuary to contribute to plastic free programs; extensive survey and monitoring of key values in marine parks; development of a fire severity mapping tool that is implemented into analysis and reporting of prescribed burn outcomes; development of historical fire impact and severity mapping layers; development of eDNA approaches to monitoring and species assessment; research and seed banking to support recovery of threatened plants and ecological communities in the Stirling Range following the bushfires of 2018 and 2019; translocation of animals to Dirk Hartog and other sites within Western Australia and captive breeding of species to support recovery programs of threatened fauna, including assisted migration to address climate change impacts.</p>
<p>We continue to pursue new opportunities and seek innovative ways to deliver science to underpin effective biodiversity conservation in Western Australia. Our current focus is on strategic planning, developing our people, engaging with our colleagues, communicating our scientific outcomes, and operating according to our shared values.</p>
<p>Our work is strengthened by our collaborations and partnerships both internally and externally. We continue to work collectively with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and Rottnest Island. We engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the newly established National Environmental Science Program hubs. We value the large number of active science partnerships and our engagement in co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage with all our partners to provide scientific excellence to support the Department&rsquo;s functions and contribute to delivery of the biodiversity science priorities for Western Australia. The scientific information we generate and the biodiversity knowledge we provide is fundamental to ensuring the unique biodiversity we have around us is conserved and valued.</p>

<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science coordinates and delivers science in the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, providing science and biodiversity knowledge to support the functions of the Parks and Wildlife Service, Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, Zoological Parks Authority and Rottnest Island Authority.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science is structured into programs focused on key themes for the delivery of targeted science to support evidence-based decision making and the conservation and land management functions of the department. Science and research is undertaken using both Western Australian Government and external funding sources.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science operates from a range of locations including Kensington, Kings Park, Perth Zoo, Woodvale, Manjimup, Bunbury, Busselton, Kununurra, and Albany, and includes the Western Australian Herbarium.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science staff have expertise in animal biology, animal breeding, aquatic ecology, biological survey, collections management, conservation biotechnology, conservation genetics, conservation medicine, conservation policy, data science, ecology, ecological restoration, ecoinformatics, ecophysiology, fire behaviour, hydrology, marine biology, plant biology, remote sensing and spatial analysis, seed biology, systematics and taxonomy.</p>",,,,,,,,ararreports/11/AnnualReport20212022_144.pdf,,

Our Science Strategic Plan and Program Plans articulate how our work contributes to delivery of the biodiversity science priorities for the State as the knowledge generated by our science is essential to ensure we conserve and value add to the unique biodiversity we have around us.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the start of 2020 presented unforeseen challenges due to the coronavirus global pandemic. While some field work was disrupted by the travel restrictions, we maintained delivery of a high level of quality science to inform conservation management. I thank all our Biodiversity and Conservation Science staff for their perseverance during this disrupted time.</p>
<p>We have continued the renewal of our capability to provide innovative science that informs current and future conservation initiatives. The strength of Biodiversity and Conservation Science resides in our people, and in the past year we have welcomed new staff with expertise in ecosystem genomics, wetland ecology, community ecology, plant genetics, water monitoring, conservation policy and species management.</p>
<p>2020 is the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of our Herbarium journal <em>Nuytsia</em> and we are celebrating with the publication of names and descriptions for 50 new plant species throughout the year. Other highlights of our scientific research includes emergency actions and monitoring to manage the impacts of bush fire on western ground parrot in Cape Arid National Park and on threatened plants and ecological communities in the Stirling Range National Park, implementation of water quality monitoring in the Swan-Canning river system, a survey of Lake Carnegie to inform identification of conservation values, temporal analysis of seagrass extent and response to a marine heatwave for the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, analysis of long term thinning experiments to inform forest management, and the first bandicoot born on Dirk Hartog Island following translocation. The great science work we undertake is facilitated by the excellent support of our administration staff.</p>
<p>As we continue to deliver excellent science to underpin effective biodiversity conservation in Western Australia we look to new opportunities. The Premier announced $7.7 million funding for the Biodiversity Information Office (BIO) to be established in DBCA and support the broader Environment Online initiative in partnership with the Commonwealth Digital Environmental Assessment Project. BIO will collate, curate, and make available biodiversity data to provide key information to support environmental management and conservation in Western Australia. I look forward to delivering on this exciting initiative in the coming years. We remain active in pursuing opportunities and seeking innovative ways for delivering science to support conservation, and we continue to communicate our scientific outputs and outcomes to a diverse range of audiences through a variety of avenues, including scientific papers, technical and popular articles, social media, conference talks, seminars and other presentations.</p>
<p>I am pleased that we continue our effective partnerships with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and the Rottnest Island Authority. We continue to engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the NESP Threatened Species Recovery and Northern Australia Environmental Resources hubs. We continue to have a large number of active science partnerships and our scientists are involved in co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to work effectively with all our partners to deliver excellent science that informs conservation and management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>

<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science coordinates and delivers science in the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, providing science and biodiversity knowledge to support the functions of the Parks and Wildlife Service, Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, Zoological Parks Authority and Rottnest Island Authority.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science is structured into programs focused on key themes for the delivery of targeted science to support evidence-based decision making and the conservation and land management functions of the department. Science and research is undertaken using both Western Australian Government and external funding sources.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science operates from a range of locations including Kensington, Kings Park, Perth Zoo, Woodvale, Manjimup, Bunbury, Busselton, Kununurra, and Albany, and includes the Western Australian Herbarium.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science staff have expertise in animal biology, animal breeding, aquatic ecology, biological survey, collections management, conservation biotechnology, conservation genetics, conservation medicine, conservation policy, ecology, ecological restoration, ecoinformatics, ecophysiology, fire behaviour, hydrology, marine biology, plant biology, remote sensing and spatial analysis, seed biology, systematics and taxonomy.</p>",ararreports/9/WaychinicupInletbeachfrontTSCvisitPmay2018SvL.jpeg,,ararreports/9/DJI0232Monty.jpeg,ararreports/9/partnershipscropped.jpeg,ararreports/9/Studentprojectreports.jpeg,ararreports/9/Publicationsandreports.jpeg,ararreports/9/Studentprojects.jpeg,ararreports/9/AnnualReport20192020_13.pdf,,

In accordance with our Science Strategic Plan and Program Plans, we deliver excellent science that informs conservation and management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges due to the coronavirus global pandemic, we have maintained delivery of a high level of quality science to inform conservation management. I thank all our Biodiversity and Conservation Science staff for their commitment and perseverance during a time of significant change. The strength of Biodiversity and Conservation Science resides in our people and our capability to provide innovative science that informs current and future conservation initiatives. Our great science work is facilitated by the excellent support of our administration staff. I am immensely proud of the Biodiversity and Conservation Science team and what we achieve together and with our partners.</p>
<p>We have had another very productive year. A major achievement has been the establishment of the Biodiversity Information Office. This initiative is a State Commonwealth partnership to collate, curate and make available biodiversity data to support environmental management and conservation in Western Australia. To ensure our biodiversity knowledge is applied most effectively, we have developed a strategic risk-based approach to provision of scientific advice and assessment of impacts. The year 2020 was the 50th anniversary of our Herbarium journal&nbsp;<em>Nuytsia</em>&nbsp;and we celebrated with the publication of names and descriptions for 50 new plant species throughout the year. Other highlights of our scientific research include: the development of innovative monitoring tools using remote sensing; audio recording and camera units in terrestrial and aquatic environments; trialing eDNA techniques for monitoring and assessing plants, animals and ecological condition; development of non-invasive faecal DNA approaches for monitoring selected animals; implementation of a fire severity mapping tool; a biological survey of Lake Carnegie to inform assessment of biodiversity values; integrated quantification of impacts, banking of germplasm and establishment of seed production areas for threatened flora affected by the 2018-19 Stirling Ranges bushfires; completion of a review of wetland values across the Swan Coastal Plain; producing plants of a threatened orchid for translocation; and breeding of dibblers for release on Dirk Hartog Island.</p>
<p>As we continue to deliver excellent science to underpin effective biodiversity conservation in Western Australia, we remain active in pursuing new opportunities and seeking innovative ways for delivering science to support conservation. We are looking to strengthen communication of our scientific outcomes to a diverse range of audiences through a variety of avenues, including scientific papers, technical and popular articles, social media, conference talks, seminars and other presentations.</p>
<p>We value our collaborations and partnerships both internally and externally. We strive to work effectively with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and Rottnest Island. We continue to engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the newly established National Environmental Science Program hubs. We value the large number of active science partnerships and our engagement in the co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to work effectively with all our partners to provide scientific excellence to support the Departments operations and contribute to the delivery of the biodiversity science priorities for Western Australia. The scientific information we generate and the biodiversity knowledge we apply is fundamental to ensuring the unique biodiversity we have around us is conserved and valued.</p>

<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science coordinates and delivers science in the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, providing science and biodiversity knowledge to support the functions of the Parks and Wildlife Service, Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority, Zoological Parks Authority and Rottnest Island Authority.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science is structured into programs focused on key themes for the delivery of targeted science to support evidence-based decision making and the conservation and land management functions of the department. Science and research is undertaken using both Western Australian Government and external funding sources.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science operates from a range of locations including Kensington, Kings Park, Perth Zoo, Woodvale, Manjimup, Bunbury, Busselton, Kununurra, and Albany, and includes the Western Australian Herbarium.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science staff have expertise in animal biology, animal breeding, aquatic ecology, biological survey, collections management, conservation biotechnology, conservation genetics, conservation medicine, conservation policy, ecology, ecological restoration, ecoinformatics, ecophysiology, fire behaviour, hydrology, marine biology, plant biology, remote sensing and spatial analysis, seed biology, systematics and taxonomy.</p>",,,,,,,,ararreports/10/AnnualReport20202021_41.pdf,,

This is achieved through world-class applied science that informs conservation and management of our diverse plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>
<p>Our consolidated &nbsp;Biodiversity and Conservation Science function continues to support business areas across the agency to achieve the department&rsquo;s Strategic Directions 2022-2025 by providing scientific excellence to support biodiversity conservation and nature-based tourism.</p>
<p>Biodiversity and Conservation Science provides innovative science through the technical expertise and capability of our science staff and the excellent support of our administration staff. The challenges we are facing as a society are impacting all of us and &nbsp;our staff continue to show their professionalism in the face of ongoing challenges. Our Conservation Science Forum in June focused on recognising and developing our people and knowledge leadership capabilities, fostering inclusion and diversity, supporting each other particularly when things seem overwhelming, and bringing open mindsets to maximise our collaborative and innovative approaches while celebrating how science supports delivery of key priorities of the department. I continue to be enormously proud of the Biodiversity and Conservation Science team and what we achieve together and with our partners.</p>
<p>Our collaborative and innovative science supports the current priorities of the department in providing knowledge and advice for delivering Plan for Our Parks, the Aboriginal Ranger program, joint management arrangements, response to climate change and renewed forest management. Other highlights of our scientific achievements this year include developing new remote area mangrove monitoring methods for use in the Kimberley Marine Parks; understanding the relationship between soil depth and tolerance to drought in jarrah; the first translocations of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo back to Two Peoples Bay National Park; the first listing of threatened ecological communities under the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>; resolving the hybrid status of two threatened eucalypt species; the first successful captive breeding of the Critically Endangered hairy marron; establishing a &lsquo;living seawalls&rsquo; trial in the Swan River; ingesting more than 2.8 million biodiversity recordsinto Dandjoo; conducting the first in-water coral and fish surveys at Bardi Jawi Garri Marine Park; and undertaking the largest threatened orchid translocation project in WA.</p>
<p>The Conferences of the Parties for Climate and Biological Diversity continue to identify the combined challenges of climate change and biodiversity decline, and the innovative science required to assist society in addressing these issues. We have new resources to work on these areas through a Climate Adaptation initiative, a changed focus on forest management in a drying climate, science to implement the Feral Cat Strategy, and biodiversity and spatial data to contribute to effective regional planning under the Native Vegetation Policy.</p>
<p>Our work is strengthened by our collaborations and partnerships both internally and externally. We continue to work collectively with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and Rottnest Island. We engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the National Environmental Science Program hubs. Co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students is evidence of our wide ranging science partnerships and we value these opportunities to work with and inspire the next generation of scientists.</p>
<p>We will continue to engage with all our partners to provide scientific excellence to support the department&rsquo;s functions and contribute to delivery of the biodiversity science priorities for Western Australia. The scientific information we generate and the biodiversity knowledge we provide is fundamental to ensuring the unique biodiversity we have around us is conserved, valued and appreciated through our natural attractions.</p>

The Chief Scientist, Professor Peter Klinken, launched our <em>Science Strategic Plan 2018-21</em> for the department in August 2018 and since then we have developed science plans for each of our 10 programs. These plans articulate how the work of each program contributes to delivery of the themes identified in the strategic plan. The science undertaken through the programs delivers against the biodiversity science priorities for the State and is essential to ensure we conserve and appreciate the unique biodiversity we have around us.</p>
<p>In conjunction with our strategic planning we are continuing the renewal of our capability to provide innovative science that informs current and future conservation initiatives. The strength of Biodiversity and Conservation Science resides in our people, and in the past year we welcomed new staff with expertise in forest science, structured decision-making, plant ecology and ecoinformatics.</p>
<p>We have continued to deliver effective science to support the department&rsquo;s functions. Highlights of our scientific research for this year include confirmation of eradication of feral cats from Dirk Hartog Island, development of a conceptual model of the hydrology of freshwater springs at Walyarta (80 Mile Beach Ramsar site), production of 900 seedlings of the spider orchid <em>Caladenia busselliana</em> for a translocation of this rare species, monitored the outbreak of the harmful algae <em>Alexandrium</em> spp. and determined toxin uptake in fish, crabs and mussels, development of spinifex cover measures from satellite imagery to inform prescribed burning activities, and analysis of data from a 30 year experimental study to understand how understorey plants in the jarrah forest respond to different combinations of fire interval and season. We have published the final report of the WAMSI Kimberley Marine Research Program, and published a book describing the red algae of Western Australia&rsquo;s tropical coast. We also celebrated 50 years of forest research at the Manjimup Research Centre. Our staff in Species and Communities Program made important contributions to the Biodiversity Conservation Regulations gazetted in January 2019 to give effect to the <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016</em>. We are working with regional staff and members of the community to implement new provisions supporting conservation of our plants, animals and ecosystems.</p>
<p>As we consolidate after the major change of the past year, I am confident we will continue to deliver excellent science and remain active in pursuing opportunities and seeking innovative ways to underpin effective biodiversity conservation in Western Australia. We have continued to communicate our scientific outputs and outcomes to a diverse range of audiences through a variety of avenues, including scientific papers, technical and popular articles, social media, conference talks, seminars and other presentations.</p>
<p>Much of our work is undertaken in partnership with conservation staff in the Parks and Wildlife Service, and at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Perth Zoo and the Rottnest Island Authority. We also engage with a wide range of external partners at universities, CSIRO, NGOs, WABSI, WAMSI and the NESP Threatened Species Recovery and Northern Australia Environmental Resources hubs. We have a large number of active science partnerships and our scientists are involved in co-supervision of many Honours, Masters and PhD students.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing to work effectively with all our partners to deliver excellent science that informs conservation and management of our diverse and inspiring plants, animals and ecosystems, and supports effective management of our parks and reserves, delivery of our fire program and engagement of visitors with our natural attractions.</p>","<p>Abbott I (2019). <em>Contributions</em> <em>to</em> <em>the</em> <em>History</em> <em>of</em> <em>Australasian</em> <em>Ornithology</em>.
