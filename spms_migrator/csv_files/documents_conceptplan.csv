390,"<p>This Science Project Plan will provide information to underpin the management of karri stands in the immature stage of development (25-120 years old). Immature stands regenerated following timber harvesting and bushfire comprise more than 50 000 ha and represent around one third of the area of karri forest managed by DEC. Significant areas of regenerated karri forest have been included in conservation reserves following changes in land tenure from State forest. Regenerated karri stands have important values for future timber production, biodiversity conservation and as a store of terrestrial carbon.</p>
<p>There are a number of well designed experiments established under previous SPPs 1993-106 and 1993_107 that investigate the dynamics of naturally regenerated and planted stands managed at a range of stand densities. These experiments span a range of site productivity and climatic gradients in the karri forest, and have been measured repeatedly over a period of several decades (McCaw and Rayner 1995), providing important information to support and improve management practices (CALM 1997, DEC in prep.). This project will draw on existing comprehensive data sets and re-focus the work on emerging issues likely to be of growing importance in the next decade. These issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>climate change and declining groundwater levels<br />
interactions with current and emerging pests and pathogens (Robinson 2003, 2005; Robinson et al. 2004)</li>
<li>increased recognition of the role of forests in maintaining global carbon cycles</li>
<li>long-term ecological dynamics in silviculturally regenerated stands (McCaw 2006).</li>
</ul>","<p>Knowledge of stand dynamics and growth, water relations and forest health to underpin the development of management strategies for regenerated forests.<br />
Opportunity for adaptive management in response to climate variability and potential threats to forest health, particularly Armillaria root disease.  </p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

1520,"<p>This project aims to build and develop a new database, <strong>BioSys</strong>, that&nbsp;provides a central repository for data generated through&nbsp;biological survey within the department.&nbsp;While there are many kinds of biological data, survey data comprises a large proportion of biological data collected by the department.</p>
<p><strong>BioSys</strong>&nbsp;will be implemented in a three-phased approach:</p>
<p>Year 1: Build database to support Kimberley Land Conservation Initiative (LCI) monitoring data<br />Year 2: Extend database to&nbsp;Kimberley Island survey data, commence development of offline data entry tool<br />Year 3: Complete&nbsp;offline data entry tool</p>","<p>BioSys will address many&nbsp;of the issues and risks outlined above. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased consistency in, and availability of, biological data</li>
<li>Data protected in perpetuity</li>
<li>Improved security and backup for legacy and operational databases</li>
<li>Improved integration with other departmental systems</li>
<li>Improved capacity for reporting, research and analysis of observation data.</li>
<li>Improved compliance with government&nbsp;requirements for knowledge management</li>
<li>Improved credibility of the department in protecting and making data available</li>
</ul>
<p>In the longer term BioSys is expected to take over all or&nbsp;part of the role of NatureMap, built on modern, supported architecture.</p>","<p>The IT sections of organisations typically hold&nbsp;systems such as BioSys at arms length, restricting themselves to the core functions of file, mail, print. In recognition of Parks and Wildlife as&nbsp;a data-rich department, and in response to government public service requirements, the Office of Information Management (OIM) established the Knowledge Management Initiative (KMI) in 2015, with the aim of&nbsp;improving knowledge management across the agency. Because of its strategic importance and benefit to the organisation, OIM has been collaborating with&nbsp;SCD to develop BioSys, and providing in-kind support and assistance. This is expected to continue through the life of the project.</p>
<p>There has been interest from at least one other State conservation agency to co-fund the development of an offline data entry tool.</p>","<p>The requirement for managing and retaining biodiversity data and information, and the current capability gaps within WA, have been highlighted in a number of strategic documents, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A&nbsp;survey database was identified as a high priority item within the Science Division Strategic Plan, 2008-17 (Science Division, 2008).</li>
<li>The need for a corporate survey database had been highlighted in&nbsp;a number of high-profile reviews, including a&nbsp;vegetation mapping workshop held in 2008 (Salt <em>et al.</em>, 2008).</li>
<li>The Barnett report&nbsp;into a Western Australian Biodiversity Knowledge System identified ""...efficient and effective access to historical information"" as the most important industry need (Australian Venture Consultants, 2012).</li>
<li>That same report included information managment as one of four essential pillars in a pathway to enhance knowledge management, which has since been reflected in the establishment of the WA Biodiversity Science Institute and the Informatics node.</li>

A key strategy for achieving this is acquiring scientific knowledge to underpin decision-making. The department therefore invests heavily in ecological survey (from small area- inventory through to major regional surveys) and on-going monitoring projects from which data are&nbsp;collected through field observation and analysed to produce new information. Because of the size of Western Australia, and the inaccessibility of many locations, data collection is typically the most expensive component of producing new information and understanding, and the datasets are often irreplaceable.</p>
<p>However, the majority of datasets collected through survey are not lodged in a corporately accessible and managed environment. While the department maintains some&nbsp;corporate scientific and management databases, these capture only a small proportion of data generated through survey, probably less than 25%. The remainder of datasets are managed on a per-project basis, satisfying individual project requirements, but invariably without due attention to on-going data maintenance and availability. To compound the issue, an increasing number of scientists and project officers responsible for historical datasets are close to retirement age. The department therefore faces an increasing and significant risk of loss of data.</p>
<p>Compounding the situation,&nbsp;data are stored in various ways ranging from spreadsheets to Microsoft Access, on desktops, laptops, or local file servers. As such, security and data protection&nbsp;are dependent on the data custodian, resulting in inconsistent practices and increased likelihood of data loss or corruption. In addition, data access is typically limited to local users, or restricted by vendor-specific applications. Departmental requirements for linking to related systems&nbsp;are&nbsp;generally not considered. And, finally, while survey methodologies are well understood, inadequate attention is paid&nbsp;to data collection and management standards (particularly ecological data, which still has developing standards), and therefore inconsistency and lack of documentation in how data attributes are defined.</p>"

1530,"<p>Hydrology is a primary driver of wetland and riverine ecosystems and aquatic species distributions, acting directly on spatial and temporal variation in water volumes or through influences on water chemistry or habitat (e.g. acidification, salinisation, fire regimes, aquatic plants for fauna, temperature or woody debris from riparian zones). Most wetland conservation issues have a hydrological basis, requiring technical expertise to investigate the problem and advise on management. This project has been developed to bring short-term hydrological assessment studies under one umbrella project. Examples of current hydrological assessment projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigations identifying the major aquifers discharging groundwater and sustaining the Walyarta (Mandora Marsh) springs. This work will provide a basis on which to interpret the potential impacts of water resource development in the associated aquifers. (2015-2017). Funded by BHP via the Kimberley Region and undertaken in collaboration with researchers at The University of Western Australia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Assessment of key hydrological management actions within the Brixton Street wetland complex. Funded by Perth Region NRM via&nbsp;a grant application prepared by the Swan Region.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals are also in development with&nbsp;the Rivers and Estuaries Division to map and understand nutrient fluxes into the Swan Estuary Marine Park and the Kimberley Region to identify and characterise different hydrological settings of the monsoon vine thicket TEC and develop effective monitoring programs.</p>
<p>Project objectives will vary but will generally involve identifying the critical hydrological parameter to manage that will improve conservation outcomes. To accomplish this a multi-disciplinary approach is employed to understand how these ecosystems vary in space and time, frequently involving collaborations with other researchers.&nbsp; Project outputs and outcomes are designed to provide more informed decision making with respect to prioritising conservation actions and assessing environmental impacts of land and water use proposals.</p>
<p>Combined. these projects fill an important role in reducing hydrological knowledge gaps, building an improved statewide understanding of the ecohydrology of threatened ecosystems and their critical hydrological parameters.</p>","<p>Improved ecosystem health and resilience through ability of conservation managers to understand local hydrological function and the critical parameters requiring management. This information will be used to 1) assess environmental impacts, 2) prioritise conservation actions, 3) set limits of acceptable change (LoAC) (e.g. in Ramsar wetlands) and 4) establish or re-evaluate baseline monitoring programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Research will be designed and conducted in collaboration with Parks and Wildlife regional staff and scientists, in particular&nbsp;ecologists from the Species and Communities Branch. External links with&nbsp;research scientists&nbsp;from other state and commonwealth agencies, universities and CSIRO will be maintained and developed further. For example, the Mandora Marsh work is being undertaken in collaboration with Greg Skyzpek and Pauline Grierson at The University of Western Australia.</p>","<p>The overarching aims of this project align with Parks and Wildlife's Strategic Directions 2014-2017, focusing on management priorities, conducting best practice science to protect threatened and priority plant and animal species and delivering on-ground conservation outcomes. Projects will be designed to assist in the development of management plans and where plans exist will focus on addressing priorities and targets relevant to the hydrology.&nbsp; For Ramsar sites hydrology project planning will be undertaken to ensure project outcomes reduce existing knowledge gaps outlined in Ecological Character Descriptions (ECD) and deliver improved limits of acceptable change (LoAC) to guide management actions.</p>","[[""Role"",""Year 1 (2015-16"",""Year 2 (2016-17"",""Year 3 (2017-18)""],[""Scientist"",""0.2"",""0.6 to 1.0"",""0.6 to 1.0""],[""Technical"",""0.2"",""0.6 to 1.0"",""0.6 to 1.0""],[""Volunteer"","""","""",""""],[""Collaborator"","""","""",""""]]","[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"","""","""",""""],[""External Funding"",""60000"",""100000"",""""]]",,,

310,"<p>Managing Australia's fragmented landscapes to ensure long-term persistence of native vegetation is a key national conservation objective that also underpins sustainable agricultural production in many regions.  Effective management of fragmented landscapes for integrated conservation/production involves four mains steps: 1) Identification of existing remnant vegetation elements; 2) determination of remnant condition/viability; 3) assessment of what vegetation elements need to be added to achieve regional persistence and how this can be done - restoration/revegetation and; 4) on going monitoring/management.</p>
<p>Information already exists for several ecosystems regarding the amount and extent of remnant vegetation (step 1) (see Dongolocking Pilot Planning Project for Remnant Vegetation) and more information of this kind is becoming available through vegetation mapping projects.  Similarly, development of restoration methods (step 3) for some vegetation communities is underway, e.g. experimental development of salmon gum woodland regeneration techniques carried out as part of LWRRDC Remnant Veg 1.  In contrast, relatively little is known about what determines the viability and long-term conservation value of existing remnant vegetation or how this relates to landscape context.  Assessment of remnant vegetation status, viability and thresholds for maintenance of condition have been explicitly identified as research priorities necessary to develop successful landscape design and management principles in the Land and Water Australia, Native Vegetation Research and Development Program, Project Brief 1.</p>
<p>Most attempts to assess remnant vegetation viability or conservation value have been based on the use of presence/absence data to determine which remnants contain either large numbers of species, or have particular focal species that are thought to be particularly sensitive to fragmentation.  This approach, though easy to implement and useful in assessing current status, often fails to explicitly identify the biological factors limiting occurrence.  This makes it less able to predict species persistence - a key element to remnant viability, and to identify remedial actions - a primary consideration for remnant restoration.  Recent research results also suggest that remnant plant populations may undergo significant periods of decline before becoming extinct and that during this their presence will inflate viability assessments based solely on species presence or absence.  This decline often appears to be as a result of the combined effects of several processes such as inbreeding and pollination failure or mate limitation and demographic stochasticity, rather than one factor alone.</p>
<p>Given this, key research issues for remnant vegetation management are: i) identification of the biological processes limiting the viability of plant populations in vegetation remnants, ii) quantification of relationships between these and more easily measured landscape characteristics such as remnant size and landscape position and iii) determination of threshold values for remnant characteristics that will maximise population viability for a range of species with varied life histories.</p>","<p>Outputs</p>

294,"<p>All Australian mistletoes are indigenous plants.  Many species are poorly known and represented by fewer than 10 collections in PERTH.  In part, this is because they are frequently overlooked on botanical surveys.  Some apparently rare species are, in fact, common.  Others seem genuinely rare.  In any event, their distribution is poorly known and I am aware of several undescribed Western Australian species.  </p>
<p>Mistletoes are unusual in that most species have no means of surviving fire (eg. as seed, bulbs, lignotubers etc) despite being very fire sensitive, living in fire prone communities and often on hosts that are killed by fire.  Where their hosts survive (eg. many eucalypts) but mistletoes are killed by fire, regeneration has to be by seed import from outside the burn area.  Birds are the vectors.  Where the hosts are also killed by fire (eg. many Acacia sp.) the process of re-colonisation can not commence until the host population has matured. </p>
<p>Mistletoes are thus threatened by extensive and/or frequent fires.  Moreover, where mistletoe diversity and/or abundance is high, they may indicate a mild fire regime over many years.  As fire histories are absent for many parts of the State, such indicators are important to fire impact research.  </p>
<p>All mistletoe species are host specific to some extent, some more than others.  Whilst mistletoes are overlooked by many botanical surveyors, recording of the host is even rarer.  Nevertheless, the fire response of hosts is critical to the process of recovery after fire by mistletoes.  Thus, knowledge of host preferences is fundamental to understanding the implications of mistletoe populations as indicators of fire regimes and in preparing fire management programs that take account of these fire-sensitive plants. </p>

300,"<p>A new fox bait, 'Probait', has been developed that will decrease the cost of CALM's operational baiting campaigns significantly. Previous experiments (see SPP 99/18) have shown that when Probaits were fed to captive phascogales (Phascogale tapoatafa), sufficient bait material was ingested to raise concerns about the potential risk of individuals of this species being poisoned during baiting campaigns using Probaits. An experiment is therefore planned to determine the actual uptake of Probaits in the field by phascogales.</p>
<p>The uptake of Probaits by foxes was also tested (see SPP 99/18) and found to be less than that of the currently used dried meat baits. This difference in uptake may be the result of a difference in field longevity between the two bait types. An experiment is planned to examine the field longevity of Probaits (in comparison with dried meat baits) and to determine the factors that may have influenced their longevity.  In particular the incidence of ant attack and the susceptibility of both bait types to the effects of rainfall will be examined. If the Probait is 10% less resistant to ant attack and/or weathering this will indicate that the difference in uptake between the two bait types may have been due to differences in their longevity. However, it will not be possible to categorically state that any differences in longevity were responsible for the observed difference in bait uptake.  Ideally the uptake experiment undertaken under SPP 99/18 should be repeated with the appropriately modified bait type.</p>
<p>To determine whether ant attack on the baits (if any) can be reduced, a sample of baits that have had ant repellent added to them during manufacture will be tested for their longevity.  If ant attack on baits is a significant factor in their longevity, then ant repellent will be added to all baits used in baiting campaigns.  </p>
<p>A harder Probait that has been dried as completely as possible will also be tested to determine if the longevity of Probaits can be increased by increasing their initial hardness. If a difference in longevity was responsible for the difference in bait uptake, and if the harder Probait is 10% more robust than the standard Probait, then this bait type may be used in future baiting campaigns. </p>
<p>If the longevity of Probaits is found to be the same as that of dried meat baits it can then be concluded that Probaits are less palatable to foxes than dried meat baits. If this is the case the use of Probaits in operational baiting campaigns will need to be re-evaluated. An experiment would need to be undertaken to determine if the level of Probait uptake is sufficient to result in faunal responses similar to those obtained by baiting with dried meat baits. This experiment would probably involve reintroducing keystone species into replicated areas of suitable habitat and monitoring survival and reproduction for 12 months. If Probaits are not as effective as dried meat baits in producing a faunal response then their use in operational baiting campaigns would not be recommended.  Fox control should then be undertaken with dried meat baits even though this would be more expensive.</p>
<p>Finally the amount of 1080 that remains in a sample of each bait type under field conditions will be examined to determine if Probaits (either standard or extra hard) retain their 1080 content so that they are as effective as dried meat baits in their ability to control foxes. </p>
<p>This work is of high priority to the Department because it will because it will reveal the limitations to the use of the more economical Probait in fox control campaigns.</p>","<p>i) A determination of whether 'Probaits' pose a serious risk to populations of phascogales in the field.</p>
<p>ii) A determination that the longevity of Probaits may be increased by either increasing their hardness or by reducing their susceptibility to ant attack.</p>
<p>iii) A determination that 'Probaits' remain as toxic to foxes for the same duration as the currently used dried meat baits under field conditions.</p>
<p>If these outcomes are achieved, and if no other factor is responsible for the comparatively lower uptake of Probaits, then the new baits should be as efficacious as the dried meat bait in controlling foxes.  </p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

<li>Although there is some material available for these species within peppermint/tuart coastal woodlands (Jones, How et al. 1994; Jones, How et al. 1994; Jones and Hillcox 1995; How and Hillcox 2000), the published literature on the ecology of the ngwayir and koomal within the jarrah forest is extremely limited.</li>
</ul>","<p>Given the limitations and variability of survey methods to detect ngwayir and koomal, the purpose of the survey method trials will be to identify what are the most appropriate means of surveying possum populations within the jarrah forest, refine the technique where possible and obtain a measure of the most appropriate survey method’s reliability, precision and accuracy. These results will be directly useful to the remainder of this study as well as have wider application for other research on these species and relevance to similar research in other forests and on other arboreal mammals.</p>
<p>The results from the ecological components of this study stand to make a substantial contribution to improving the understanding of the ecology of these possums within the jarrah forest – something which is so far almost completely absent in the published literature. The life history research will provide a fundamental biological basis of understanding of these animals within the jarrah forest. The habitat selection study and the examination into the factors explaining the distribution and abundance of these possums will provide detail of the ecology of these species with respect to their interactions within and between possum species, with predators (principally foxes), logging activities, fire and elements of the habitat such as climate, vegetation structure and floristics and topography.</p>
<p>This research will also make a substantial contribution to the understanding of the conservation status of the ngwayir in particular. As such the results from this study will serve to provide information directly relevant to improving the conservation and management of the ngwayir and koomal and will have broader ecological relevance.</p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

314,"<p>Until 1987, the Heath Mouse Pseudomys shortridgei was thought to be extinct in WA where it had been described from specimens collected in 1931. It is now known from only 5 locations in the southern wheatbelt and south coast areas of the state. It is also known from only two conservation areas in southwest Victoria. The Heath Mouse is listed as Endangered under Commonwealth legislation. In WA it is listed as “fauna that is rare, or likely to become extinct” and is the only threatened rodent in this State lacking a conservation program (Morris, 1995). The development of a recovery plan has been delayed by a lack of knowledge of the species.</p>
<p>Little is known of the biology and ecological requirements of the heath mouse. The limited studies undertaken here and in Victoria suggest that habitat requirements may be quite different between the states. (Cockburn 1978, Chapman 1995), and that fire history is an important factor in the distribution of this species. The taxonomic relationship between the WA and Victorian populations is also unknown and needs to be resolved.  If the WA populations are a different taxa, it is likely the conservation status of this species would increase.</p>
<p>Fire is used as a management tool on several of the conservation reserves where the heath mouse persists and mining interests are becoming an increasing presence in adjoining areas. Information on these potentially limiting factors and also the possible effects of predation by introduced species, is required.</p>
<p>Negotiation is underway for support from BHP/Billiton (RNO) and a PhD application </p>",<p>From this project we will be able to place the Heath Mouse into a regional and Australian context. It will provide current and the only data on the status and ecology of the species in WA. From this we will be able to identify and document potential threats and assist in the formulation of management plans. Post-graduate studies will investigate disturbance impacts more closely. This species is known to occur on mining leases near Ravensthorpe and the findings from this study may assist to minimize any potential impacts.

315,"<p>Dryandra Woodland is a significant wheatbelt reserve with thirteen of its 27 species of mammals (excluding bats) still extant.  Since the early 1980’s there has been an ongoing fox control program that has resulted in the recovery of a number of Critical Weight Range endemic species in the Woodland.  This has allowed the translocation of these species to other reserves within this state and the eastern states eg numbats have been translocated to seven WA reserves and to a private sanctuary, in each of WA, South Australia and New South Wales.  Dryandra Woodland has been selected for its significant conservation value and as a site for Western Shield fauna reconstruction.</p>
<p>Many of the mammal species that have become extinct in the wheatbelt persist elsewhere in WA and the Northern Territory.  Due to the isolation and difficulty of obtaining some of these locally extinct species it would be more efficient and cost effective to establish a captive-breeding program for these species within the wheatbelt.  Dryandra Woodland with its infrastructure and availability of DCLM District staff is the ideal site to establish a captive-breeding colony for some of these species for the purpose of fauna reconstruction within the Woodland and other DCLM reserves.</p>
<p>The establishment of a large breeding enclosure in Dryandra Woodland would allow the investigation into a range of reintroduction techniques, and would enable animals brought in from islands, the arid zone and intensive captive breeding facilities to be acclimatised.  It will enable research to be conducted into breeding and husbandry techniques, and will allow comparison of the effectiveness of large and intensive breeding facilities.</p>
<p>Five species will be considered for the project.  They are the Western Barred Bandicoot or marl (Perameles b. bougainville), the Burrowing Bettong or boodie (Bettongia lesueur), the Rufous Hare-wallaby or mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus - unnamed subspecies), the Banded Hare-wallaby or merrnine (Lagostrophus f. fasciatus) and the Bilby or dalgyte (Macrotis lagotis).</p>
<p>The boodie, merrnine, marl are extinct on the mainland and only persist on offshore islands in WA.  The mala type specimen, from SW of WA, is extinct; the mainland subspecies only persist in captivity, but has been successfully introduced to Trimouille Is, WA.  The WA southwest subspecies of the dalgyte is extinct, but the species persist in fragmented populations in northern WA, the NT and southwest corner of Queensland.</p>

316,"<p>The Walpole-Nornalup National Park contains large areas of old growth Karri, Jarrah and Tingle forest. The forests of the Walpole-Nornalup area are estimated to have a high proportion (approx. 75%, Van Heurck, Burbidge and Wheeler 2000) of arthropod species with Gondwanan affinities. These forests also contain a number of threatened and short-range endemic species. In these forests short-range endemics make up the majority of species in the following invertebrate groups: Gastropoda (snails), Oligochaeta (earthworms), Onychophora (velvet worms), Araneae (trapdoor and other spiders), Diplopoda (millipedes), Phreatoicidea (slaters) and Decapods (freshwater crayfish) (Harvey 2002). Little is known of the ability of these short-range endemic species and their litter communities to survive both wild and managed fires. Also no long term systematic survey of the fire impact on the species composition of the litter invertebrate communities of these forests has been carried out to date.</p>
<p>Recent worldwide estimates of the number of species of living organisms (Stork, 1999) are of the order of 12.5 million species (invertebrates, vertebrates and plants), of which 11 million are arthropod species. The inventory of arthropod species is therefore critical to the state’s requirement to conserve the biodiversity of regions such as the old growth forests. Recent bio-survey methods allow the simultaneous study of fire impacts on the majority of species of an entire ecosystem component such as the forest floor litter community. The advantage of this, is that a rapid inventory of species of a wide range of arthropod groups in the litter community of each site is achieved, in addition to determining fire impacts on any short-range endemics at each site, while also comparing the post-fire species composition between sites with a range of fire regimes. This allows extrapolation to other similar old-growth forest ecosystems containing short range endemic species, as well as predicting the impact of similar fire regimes and post-fire ages on the richness and species composition of entire litter arthropod communities in these nearby forests.</p>
<p>Following the March 2001 wildfire in the Nuyts Wilderness, a large group of local volunteers have been trapping and inventorying the litter arthropod species of these forest sites, as well as long unburnt sites nearby. This is establishing a comprehensive collection of local arthropod species and allowing the fire tolerances of these species to be determined. The outcome should be adaptive fire management of these old growth areas to conserve the full range of arthropod biodiversity. The extension of this study over a three year period will allow documentation of the early post-wildfire species succession.</p>","<ul>

318,"<p>Control of feral cats is recognised as one of the most important conservation issues in Australia today. The impact of feral cats on native fauna is acknowledged by Commonwealth legislation, as outlined in Schedule 3 of the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. The national ‘Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats’ (Anon. 1999) lists 38 species on Schedule 1 of the above Act for which there is a known or inferred threat from feral cat populations. That is, 38 endangered species have been identified as potentially benefiting from effective feral cat control, as part of their management/recovery programs.</p>
<p>Predation by feral cats (Felis catus) has been identified as one of the major obstacles to the reconstruction of the fauna, particularly small to medium-sized mammals, in the arid and semi-arid zones of Australia (Dickman 1996; Anon. 1999). Anecdotal evidence has indicated that predation by feral cats, either acting singly or in concert with other factors, has resulted in the local extinction of a number of species on islands and mainland Australia.  Many of these species are now restricted to several offshore islands, others have undergone dramatic contractions in their former mainland range.  Due to small population sizes and restricted geographic ranges these species are vulnerable to total extinction. </p>
<p>Predation by feral cats also affects the continued survival of many native species persisting at low population levels (Dickman 1996; Smith and Quin 1996) and has prevented the successful re-introduction of species to parts of their former range (Gibson et al. 1994; Christensen and Burrows 1994). </p>
<p>Broad-scale baiting offers the best option to control feral cats in strategic areas and is seen as the method most likely to produce an effective operational method for cat control (Anon. 1999). Development of an effective baiting technique for the control of the feral cat is cited as a high priority by the national Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats (Anon. 1999). The Department of Conservation and Land Management has designed and developed a bait medium that is attractive to feral cats and effective in controlling them on a localised scale. The baits are manufactured at the Department’s Bait Factory at Harvey. This bait medium has been employed as an integral part of successful island cat eradication programs off the Western Australian coast (Algar and Burbidge 2000; Algar et al. in press) and was used as the sole tool of eradication on Faure Island (Algar et al. in prep.). The program, in progress, described in this SPP is aimed at developing optimal broad-scale control programs for feral cats. </p>",<p>The step-wise approach to developing an optimal broad-scale cat predation control strategy for wildlife recovery outlined above is being pursued to provide for effective and cost-efficient wildlife recovery.  The focus is on optimising cat predation control through aerial baiting and providing a comprehensive evaluation of any impact on non-target species populations.  The program is structured to enable analysis of the cost-benefit of various baiting regimes on both feral cats and non-target species and provide information essential to gaining registration of the cat bait.  Once registration is achieved the baiting protocols developed will be able to be implemented across the arid and semi-arid interior of Australia and perhaps elsewhere in the world.</p>,,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

368,"<p>This project will provide important information on the recovery of the New Zealand fur seal (NZFS), and to a lesser extent, Australian sea lion (ASL) populations which were reduced to near extinction in WA due to commercial harvesting in the 19 &amp; 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. These data are essential for wildlife managers to effectively conserve these protected species under the NRM priority of Recovering Biodiversity and also will give essential information to manage interactions with commercial fishing activities under the NRM priority Enhanced Protection of Marine and coastal environment, and to a lesser extent provide important information relevcant to the Commonwealth draft recovery plan for the Australian sea lion, and for the South-west regional Marine Park management plan.</p>
<p>Changes in abundance and distribution of the NZFS have been observed over the past ten years and extensions to the range appear to be occurring along the south-west coast. The timing of this survey is consistent with the planned management of this species as outlined in the Pinniped Management Plan (PMP, Campbell &amp; Gales in prep.) and methodology will follow that of the previous two surveys (Gales et al. 2000). This will be the third survey of this species over the past 20 years and is urgently required. This will allow us to better understand the patterns of population expansion over the last 10 years and to predict likely patterns of future population expansion and areas of interaction. Information on the breeding schedule of the ASL will also be collected and is a priority area of research for this listed Threatened species in both the draft State PMP and the Commonwealth draft recovery plan (DEWHA 2010). The expansion of the NZFS population into warmer waters and outside of the historical distribution provides some important indications of how different species will respond to climate change. </p>
<p>The results from this project and further biological information will be publicly presented at a number of forums to develop a greater awareness and understanding of the biology of the two resident seal species in WA. Possible approaches to mitigate interactions with fishing gear and reduce incidental mortality as well as reducing product loss for the commercial fishers will be discussed. There are concerns among many commercial fishers about the rise in interactions with NZFS in particular, including the depredation of target prey and the ecological consequences of such an increase in abundance of this marine predator. In addition, there are some concerns over the proximity of new haulout and breeding areas of NZFS to popular aquatic recreation areas (Cape Naturaliste &amp; Rottnest Is), and the potential increase in NZFS predators (great white sharks) in these areas. </p>","<p>To survey the pup production of NZFS by direct counting at all known breeding sites across WA. </p>

324,"<p>Recent genetic work has suggested that the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale nov sp) in Western Australia (the wambenger) is a distinct species when compared with eastern Australian and northern populations of Phascogale tapoatafa.  There is also some evidence that wambenger populations have declined recently, although the cause of these declines remains unknown. Whilst hypothetical ‘natural’ cyclical fluctuations may account for at least some of these declines it is also possible that management activities such as fox baiting, logging and/ or fire may also be causal factors. In this study the locality records of brush-tailed phascogales will be collated from museum and other sources and will be examined to determine if reporting frequency has declined recently and if so when. </p>
<p>The brush-tailed phascogale was the subject of a PhD study by Susan Rhind.  Rhind (1994) studied the abundance of wambengers at 12 sites across the state and did a concentrated ecological study at Kingston and Perup forest areas in the Warren Region.  Since Rhind completed her studies trapping for wambengers in some of her sites has been continued by staff in the Warren Region.  In this study all the sites in which wambengers were previously captured will be reinvestigated to determine their current abundance. The abundance of wambengers in other sites will also be investigated.  These sites will either be unlogged and unbaited, unlogged and baited, or baited and logged.  No sites that are logged and unbaited could be found.</p>
<p>The potential impact that fox baiting programmes may have on populations of wambengers will be investigated.  In a captive study wambengers were fed both the currently used dried meat bait (DMB) and the new fox bait being developed by DCLM: ‘Probait’ (Martin et al. 2002).  Some wambengers consumed sufficient amounts of both bait types for them to be potentially at risk from baiting programs.  The risk from Probaits was higher than for dried meat baits.  Before Probaits can be used operationally the risk to wambengers in the field from this bait type needs to be quantified.  When an appropriately sized population of wambengers (a minimum of 32 individuals will be required to ensure that some statistical validity can be attributed to the results but as many individuals as possible will be used) has been identified the area will be baited with non-toxic, biomarker-labelled baits.  The wambengers in that area will then be captured and their whiskers examined for the presence of the biomarker.  The biomarker rhodamine will be used and this leaves a characteristic pink band in any animal that ingests it.  The proportion of wambengers that reveal the biomarker will indicate the number that would have been affected by a lethal baiting campaign and thus whether the population is at risk can be determined.  </p>
<p>The distributional and abundance data collected in this study will be used to determine the appropriate IUCN status for this species.  If applicable Phascogale nov sp. might be listed on the state and Commonwealth’s endangered fauna lists.</p>","<ol>

334,"<p>Findings from CALM’s <em>Operation Foxglove</em> resulted in recommendations to increase the standard operational 1080 baiting regime from a frequency of four baitings per year to six baitings per year for large areas of the multiple use northern jarrah forest.  The findings were based on a long term study of survivorship of translocated populations of the brush-tailed bettong, or woylie, <em>Bettongia penicillata</em>.  The preferred model to describe the survivorship data was constrained by the covariate “released in winter” and suggested survivorship was lower for woylies released in winter.  This model found the probability of woylie survivorship in areas baited six times per year was significantly higher over the duration of the study than in areas baited at the standard operational baiting frequency of four times per year (de Tores_ et al.<em>, 1998; de Tores</em> et al.<em>, in prep-a).  Population modeling also showed translocated populations were unlikely to persist in the presence of the standard baiting regime (de Tores</em> et al._, in prep-a).</p>
<p>The survivorship study, based on a sample size of 366 radio collared woylies monitored continuously over a 33 month period, also indicated the number of radio-collared woylie mortality events attributed to predation by cats was greater in two of the three fox baited treatments than in the unbaited control (de Tores_ et al._, in prep-a).  The data suggest a reduction in the number of predation events attributed to foxes was compensated for by an increase in the number of predation events attributed to cats.  This pattern is consistent with the principle of mesopredator release.  Similar conclusions were drawn from survivorship data for woylies translocated from Western Australia and South Australia to Yathong Nature Reserve, western NSW.  The Yathong Nature Reserve translocation was deemed to have failed as a result of predation by cats.  Foxes were considered to no longer be a threat to wildlife at Yathong, however, in the presence of fox control, 74% of the known predation events were attributed to predation by cats (Priddel and Wheeler, 2004).  Results from woylie translocations elsewhere have rarely been able to demonstrate translocation success.  Of approximately 34 translocations in Western Australia, only four (to Yendicup forest (Perup), Batalling forest, Boyagin Nature Reserve and Karakamia Sanctuary) have unequivocally demonstrated translocation success.  Of these, Batalling is a known anomaly as it supports a suite of rare fauna with populations of at least two species established as a result of translocation.  Boyagin Nature Reserve is within 50km of Dryandra (the source of the translocated woylies) and it is hypothesised that translocation success is a function of the presence of critical habitat attributes and effective fox control.  Similarly, the habitat at Yendicup is comparable to that in neighbouring forest areas where woylies have persisted.  Karakamia Sanctuary is enclosed by a predator proof (fox and cat proof) fence and provides no opportunity for re-invasion by cats.  The combined results suggest that in some sites, fox control alone is insufficient to result in translocation success for the woylie and successful translocations are dependent on cat exclusion and/or the presence of specific habitat attributes.  In the absence of a target specific cat bait, CALM’s ability to control cats will be limited (i.e. cat baiting may not be possible in the south-west forests where non-target species occur).  </p>
<p>Foxglove data also demonstrated re-invasion of foxes occurred within two weeks of an aerial baiting event and fox density was higher in forest areas closer to the interface with agricultural land than in core areas of the forest.  The number/proportion of foxes surviving a 1080 baiting event in the northern jarrah forest was unknown, as was the extent to which foxes may be bait shy or bait wary.</p>
<p>The interactions between the two introduced predator species (fox and cat) and the resident native predator species from the northern jarrah forest, the chuditch, <em>Dasyurus geoffroii</em>, are also poorly understood.  Predation by chuditch was thought to be limiting translocation success of the western ringtail possum, <em>Pseudocheirus occidentalis</em>, in baited areas of the northern jarrah forest (de Tores, unpublished data).  Data from other western ringtail possum translocation sites has also clearly implicated predation by cats and  pythons to be limiting translocation success (de Tores, 2005; de Tores_ et al.<em>, 2005a; de Tores</em> et al.<em>, 2005b) and mesopredator release has been strongly implicated as a potential reason for this lack of success (de Tores, 2005).  There has been no assessment of the effect of fox control on the two large predatory varanids, _Varanus gouldii</em> and <em>V. rosenbergi</em>.  </p>","<p>The project will determine whether fox control results in detrimental indirect effects.  Specifically, it will determine if cat abundance increases in the presence of fox control and if so, does this result in negative conservation outcomes.  In achieving this, the project will test the mesopredator release hypothesis.  The project will also assess fauna response in relation to fox and cat abundance and a suite of environmental factors.</p>
<p>Managers will be better placed by knowing if fox control does result in detrimental indirect effects and can make more informed decisions on the benefits of fox control in the absence of cat control.</p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,
333,"<p>The advance of Cane Toads towards Western Australia has caused tremendous concern about their impacts on the native fauna of the Kimberley region. Despite, the presence of this introduced species in Australia since the 1930s, surprisingly little is known about its ecological effects. While Northern Quolls (_Dasyurus hallucatus, _Oakwood 2003), some goannas (Burnett 1997) and a couple of snakes (Phillips, Brown and Shine 2003) are known to be killed by toads; data on impacts on other fauna is either anecdotal or non-existent ( for a review, see <a href=""http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened"">www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened</a>). Impacts of cane toads are potentially threefold: competition with native species, predation of native invertebrates/vertebrates and destruction of wildlife due to lethal toxic ingestion.</p>
<p>CALM has supported the nomination of Cane Toads as a &ldquo;key threatening process&rdquo; under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999, noting that &ldquo;it was a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function.&rdquo; Most of the limited research conducted in the Northern Territory and Queensland has focused on the impacts of Cane Toads on frogs and those species that might consume toads (e.g. quolls). Vertebrates most at risk would appear to be frogs, frog-eating snakes, goannas and dasyruids. This proposal deals with major reptile, frog and marsupial groups most at risk. Other research is required on turtles, birds and invertebrate groups, especially endemic land snails.</p>
<p>Research underway in the Northern Territory is examining the impacts of toads on goannas and a range of terrestrial vertebrates in Kakadu National Park (Watson and Woinarski 2003). Unfortunately, sites were only sampled for 1-2 years prior to the arrival of toads, limiting the interpretation of results. However, it was concluded that quolls, goannas (considered as a group), gilbert&rsquo;s dragons and perhaps elapid snakes had declined. Other research on impacts on goannas and crocodiles (Griffiths, pers. comm.; Doody, pers. comm.) is ongoing. Cane Toads reached Fogg Dam (NT) this wet season allowing observation on the effects on floodplain snakes and some frogs (Shine, University of Sydney, pers. comm.). Toad competition and predation on native invertebrates has received little attention, but is constrained by sampling/ taxonomic problems and seasonal and temporal variation in invertebrate populations. Much of the information available on Cane Toad impacts is anecdotal or based on studies that have lacked sufficient pre-toad data to determine the impact of cane toads relative to other environmental variables such as rainfall or disturbances such as fire. Further, many species have not been studied at all; at present we can only guess the probable impact of cane toads.</p>
<p>CALM has an opportunity to carry out complimentary and novel research on the impact of cane toads which can be used to plan for the conservation of species including localized control of toads, small scale fencing, translocation of threatened fauna, establishment of captive populations; among other options. The Kimberley region contains many endemic vertebrates as well as species with broader tropical distributions that may be severely affected by Cane Toads. Given the proximity of Cane Toads to the East Kimberley, it is important to establish research projects now, in advance of the potential arrival of cane toads to ensure that adequate data on existing assemblages of terrestrial vertebrates are collected so impacts can be detected.</p>
<p>Is this approach fatalistic? Should we be putting all our efforts into stopping cane toads and not worrying about research on impacts? Current trapping efforts will not stop toads. If some research work is not undertaken, we will have lost an opportunity to understand their impacts on East Kimberley and other northern fauna. This would severely limit our capacity to understand the susceptible elements of the fauna and so restrict management efforts to prevent populations declines and extinctions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After discussions with a range of colleagues within and beyond CALM, it appears that where we can target our research most usefully is to examine some of those faunal groups either endemic to the Kimberley, largely restricted to Western Australia or not studied in any detail in the N.T. or Queensland. Those vertebrates most likely to be impacted by cane toads (i.e. frogs, large predatory reptiles and dasyurids) are not well sampled by standard survey techniques such as pitfall trapping (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2004). This project advocates the use of &ldquo;cafeteria trials&rdquo; to quickly assess the susceptibility of a range of fauna to cane toad ingestion with radio-telemetry of large individuals where captive trials are unsuitable.</p>","<p>a. Accurate model of the spread of cane toads to allow planning and action by managers in advance of their arrival at various sites in the Kimberley.</p>

338,"<p>The European red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) arrived in the south-west of WA in the late 1920s (King and Smith 1985) and has been implicated in the decline of several species of medium-sized marsupials (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989).  Like all canids, foxes are highly susceptible to the toxin sodium monofluoroacetate, or 1080 (McIlroy 1981, McIlroy and King 1990) while most native WA mammals are tolerant to this poison (King <em>et al.</em> 1978, 1981; Mead <em>et al.</em> 1979).  In areas of Western Australia where foxes were controlled with regular 1080 poisoning, populations of rock-wallabies (<em>Petrogale lateralis</em>), numbat (<em>Myrmecobius fasciatus</em>), tammar wallaby (<em>Macropus eugenii</em>), woylie (<em>Bettongia penicillata</em>), brushtail possum (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>), and chuditch increased significantly (Kinnear <em>et al.</em> 1988, 1998, Kinnear 1990, Friend 1990, Start <em>et</em> <em>al. _1998, Morris _et al</em>. 2003).  In 1996, the Western Shield fauna recovery program commenced (Bailey 1996), with fox baiting occurring over approximately 3.5 million hectares of conservation estate.  In a short space of time, this led to a significant increase in woylie, quenda (southern brown bandicoot <em>Isoodon obesulus</em>) and tammar wallaby populations, and in 1998 these species were removed from the State and Commonwealth threatened fauna lists (Morris <em>et al.</em> 1998).</p>
<p>However, by 2000/2001 Western Shield monitoring started to detect declines in populations of some medium-sized mammals, most notably woylies, which had attained extremely high abundances (up to 60% trap success).  In a review of Western Shield in 2003, Orell (2005) identified several sites in the south-west of WA where fauna had not recovered, or had declines, despite ongoing fox control.  Lake Magenta nature reserve was one of these sites.  Chuditch were reintroduced to Lake Magenta in 1996 and woylies were translocated there in 1997. Following 12 months of fox control, populations of the quenda and brushtail possum were also discovered. Presumably they had persisted at Lake Magenta prior to fox control commencing, but at undetectable levels.  Trap success rates for all species increased in the period 1996-2001.  However, after this time, trap success rates for quenda and woylies declined to a point where they are no longer trapped, and chuditch and brushtail possums have persisted, but at reduced abundances.</p>
<p>This project is part of a larger program examining introduced predator control and sustained fauna recovery in the rangelands and south-west of WA.  In particular this project will be examining whether there has been a mesopredator release effect after several years of fox control ie have other introduced / native predators increased in abundance and become a threatening process for fauna survival.</p>","<p>Knowledge of the causal factors responsible for declines of medium-sized mammals at Lake Magenta nature reserve, leading to more effective management and species conservation.  This will be achieved through:</p>
<p>·         An assessment of the effectiveness of the current fox control program.</p>
<p>·         Determining whether mesopredator release (i.e. increased cat abundance) occurs following fox control.</p>
<p>·         Identifying periods of peak abundance of potential fox/cat prey items to assist in improving fox/cat baiting efficacy. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>·         If necessary, the development of a baiting regime to effectively control both foxes and feral cats, and the testing of the effectiveness of this through translocations of vulnerable species.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the biodiversity significance of these environments is far from complete, but what is known indicates that these isolated peaks are behaving as important refugia for flora and fauna, they are a focus for rare and priority species, and restricted vegetation communities including some recognized as Threatened Ecological Communities, and are likely to support short range endemic fauna (Bennett (1987), Gibson et al.

349,"<p>Accurate and effective identification of specimens of plant and animal taxa is essential for biodiversity survey, ecology, conservation assessment, and almost all other branches of biological research that require a taxonomic assignment of specimens. In particular, surveys conducted as part of the environmental assessment process, such as by environmental consultants working on development approvals, require that identifications of plants be accurate and can be done in an efficient and timely manner. Without accuracy in identifications, the presence and occurrence of rare or other conservation-listed taxa in development areas may be missed, resulting in negative conservation outcomes; conversely, the presence and occurrence of such taxa outside development zones may also be missed without effective means of identification, with negative consequences for resource development and planning.</p>
<p>In addition to these formal uses of identification tools, broad community engagement with plant biodiversity is enhanced by the availability of simple, effective and accessible means of identifying wildflowers and other plants. Many botanical resources such as floras and their identification keys are relatively inaccessible and intractable for community users. The development of user-friendly and accessible identification keys helps encourage active community participation in this area.</p>

369,"<p>The Montebello/Barrow islands are situated in the Pilbara Offshore marine bioregions (IMCRA, 1997) approximately 1,600km north of Perth.  The waters and reefs surrounding these remote islands are characterised by geomorphological and oceanographic conditions which provide a diverse range of marine habitats for a variety of both widely distributed and endemic tropical marine species.  The marine environment is generally considered to be in a relatively undisturbed condition as a result of low human usage and strict management controls on industry activities in the area. The Montebello/Barrow Islands Marine Protected Areas (MBIMPAs), incorporating the Montebello Marine Park, Barrow Island Marine Park and the Barrow Island Marine Management Area, were gazetted in 2004 and the conservation and management objectives for these reserves are expressed in the management plan for the MBIMPA.</p>
<p>The Gorgon Project (GP) which is based on Barrow Island is one of the world's largest natural gas projects and the largest single resource natural gas project in Australia's history. The plant will include three, 5 million-tonne-per-annum LNG trains, with domestic gas piped to the mainland, and a four kilometre long loading jetty for international shipping. The Gorgon Gas Development Revised and Expanded Proposal: Barrow Island Nature Reserve was approved by the Western Australian Government in September 2009 subject to a number of conditions and a commitment by the Gorgon Joint Venture participants to fund a series of conservation initiatives titled “Additional Gorgon Joint Venture Undertakings”.  A final investment decision (FID) was made by Chevron and industry partners to begin the project.</p>
<p>The GP includes a dredging program that will involved the removal and dumping of ~ 7.6M tonnes of marine sediment over a period of approximately 18 months and started in May 2010. The conditional approval for the GP included conditions for environmental compliance monitoring programs (including a marine baseline project and a ‘near-field’ marine monitoring program by Chevron) and a number of environmental offsets, one of which was a total of $2.5 M over three years to DEC to assess the potential impacts of the dredging on marine biodiversity over the broader scale of the MBIMPAs.  </p>

353,"<p>The Western Australian Department of Water (DoW) is investigating options for developing additional groundwater resources in the Pilbara, including a number of aquifers associated with major rivers on the Roebourne Plains (State Water Plan, Government of Western Australia 2007). A number of aquifers have been selected for detailed investigation and assessment to be completed as part of DoW’s Pilbara Water Smart Australia project. These include alluvial aquifers associated with the Fortescue, Yule and De Grey rivers. Investigations will include hydrogeological assessment, estimation of ecological water requirements and determination of allocation limits for these resources. Ultimately this information will be summarised as statutory water resource management plans due for completion in 2011. As a contribution to this process, the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) was contracted to undertake an investigation into the relationships between river pool aquatic invertebrates and habitat variables that may be affected by groundwater drawdown associated with water extraction.</p>
<p>Many river pools in lowland reaches of Pilbara Rivers are maintained by groundwater inflows from alluvial aquifers during the dry season, so are groundwater dependant ecosystems. Lowering groundwater tables could reduce the longevity of such pools during the dry season and affect water quality, the latter especially where declining water availability concentrates the impacts of cattle.</p>
<p>There is a growing body of knowledge on the ecology and ecological water requirements of aquatic invertebrates in dryland rivers, with much of this work having been done in Australia, especially in the Lake Eyre and Murray Darling basins (e.g. Boulton and Jenkins, 1998; Boulton and Hancock, 2006; Boulton et al., 2006; Costelloe et al., 2004 and Sheldon et al., 2002). From this work it is evident that aquatic invertebrate communities are strongly affected by various aspects of riverine hydrological regimes, including the extent, timing, frequency, reliability and duration of both floods and droughts. Not all of this work will be directly applicable to determining ecological water requirements in the Pilbara, for two reasons. Firstly, the work undertaken to date has focused on the effects of reduced flows, primarily in relation to floodplain ecology. In the Pilbara, proposed groundwater resource developments will not affect river flows and off channel flooding, which arise as a result of rains further inland, but they could affect water levels in pools once flows cease. Effects of drought on pool communities in dryland regions are poorly understood, especially in terms of ecological water requirements (Lake 2003, Boulton 2003). Secondly, eastern Australian river systems are very different in nature to those in the Pilbara in that they have comparatively subdued topography, more braided channels, extensive floodplains with large numbers of off-channel wetlands, less predictable hydrological regimes and are mostly not maintained by fresh groundwater once flows cease (see above references). These differences mean that studies particular to the Pilbara will be needed to determine ecological water requirements of wetlands potentially affected by groundwater drawdown.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive study of Pilbara wetlands to date has been the Pilbara Biological Survey. Aquatic invertebrates were included in that survey (Pinder et al., in review.) but too few lowland pools were sampled in that project to provide the sort of information needed by DoW. There has been some work undertaken to determine river pool ecological water requirements on the lower De Grey River (van Dam et al. 2005), but this was just one river, invertebrate identifications were to family level only and sampling intensity did not match the large Pilbara Biological Survey dataset, making it difficult to assess relative conservation values.</p>
<p>The project described here is not intended to develop specific ecological water requirement models for potential groundwater development projects. Such an objective would require a much larger and longer project. Instead, given fixed funding and time constraints, the project will investigate the relative conservation values of lowland river pools for aquatic invertebrates in the three rivers of interest and describe patterns in their distribution in relation to river pool habitat variables that may be affected by reduced groundwater levels.</p>","<p>The project will determine whether lowland river pools in the Pilbara have conservation values that are not replicated elsewhere (either in lowland areas of other catchments or in other areas of the Pilbara) and that therefore require particular attention when planning for development of new groundwater resources.</p>

365,"<p>The contribution of canker fungi to stem and branch death in South Western Australia has largely been ignored (Davison &amp; Tay 1983, Shearer 1992). Past records have shown that two days with temperatures over 40ºC and high winds was associated with rapid extension of Botryosphaeria sp. lesions in Banksia speciosa leading to the death of affected trees near Hopetoun (Shearer 1994). Since 1994 there has been a steady increase in canker reports and samples received for identification particularly in the declared rare flora Banksia verticillata, B.brownii as well as non threatened taxa such as B. baxteri, B. coccinea, and B. sessilis. South Coast Regional staff have expressed concern that many of the natural populations of B. anatona, B. verticillata and Lambertia orbifolia spp. orbifolia (including a translocated population) DRF appear to be succumbing to canker by degrees. Families outside the Proteaceae are also impacted, eg. Acacia accuminatus and Calothamnus quadrifidus are also recorded as having high rates of branch and stem cankers (Pathogen of the month 2007, DEC records).</p>
<p>Observation and increase in sample numbers suggests that the incidence and severity of these events is increasing which indicates a shift in the host/pathogen/environment disease triangle has occurred. As the hosts are endemic and the pathogens also appear endemic this leaves environmental change as the likely reason for the change in impact. Quantification of canker incidence and severity requires semi permanent transects to be established and monitored across the region and compared simultaneously with climatic data.</p>
<p>Direct therapy for the affected hosts is one management option available within a holistic disease management strategy. As Denman (2004) has been able to show reduced canker activity with application of several fungicides in Protea magnifica in the field it is quite likely that these fungicides will be capable of reducing impact of cankers in affected species particularly B. verticillata and L. orbifolia in the South Coast of Western Australia.</p>","<p>Predictive capacity of canker impact in Proteaceae with temperature increases.

366,"<p>Wet pitfall trapping has been a method used for at least the last 30 years (Martin 1977) to sample assemblages of ground dwelling invertebrate across time frames ranging from weeks to several months and, occasionally years.  This sampling method utilises open containers (often one or two litre plastic jars) containing preservative solutions and buried flush with the ground. Where these traps are set over long time frames preservative solutions that are stable and do not evaporate have been employed and these have incorporated various ratios of glycol (ethylene or propylene) with other preservatives and fixatives such as formalin or ethyl alcohol (Upton and Norris 1980). A comparison of the preservation attributes for invertebrate samples  of  these chemicals, along with a number of other additives, was conducted by Schmidt et al. (2006) where they concluded  that ethylene glycol had better sampling efficiencies and conservation attributes than brine, water or ethanol.</p>
<p>The long time frames over which traps can be left open, particularly in remote areas, allows a cost efficient sampling method that can span the often brief and unpredictable  activity patterns of terrestrial invertebrates. Consequently our understanding of patterns of invertebrate species incidence and species richness has been dramatically improved as a result of this technique. In Western Australia wet pitfall trapping has been critical for evaluating invertebrate assemblages in DEC’s bioregional biodiversity surveys (Burbidge et al. 2000; Keighery et al. 2004; George et al. 2010) and as part of the forest biodiversity monitoring program (Department of Environment and Conservation 2006) as well as frequently being used by environmental consultants undertaking sampling for short range endemic invertebrates.</p>
<p>One of the undesirable consequences of wet pitfall trapping is the amount vertebrate by-catch and this has become a major ethical concern in recent years (New 1999; Thompson et al. 2008). Of particular concern to Animal Ethics Committees are the number of individual animals caught, the way they succumb within the solutions and the fact that beyond morphological identification most vertebrate samples have no other scientific value. Ethylene glycol and additives generally denatures DNA, leave vertebrates discoloured, desiccated, distorted and sometimes partially decomposed (Western Australian Museum 2007). Death is likely to take place over a prolonged time frame while the animal swims in a chemical that  is a considerable irritant and is toxic when ingested (Hall 1991).</p>
<p>While it is highly desirable to continue the use of wet pitfall trapping in biogeographic survey, biodiversity monitoring and environmental impact assessments due to the utility and efficiency of the technique, Animal Ethics Committees will require key ethical issues in relation to vertebrate by-catch to be addressed (Department of Environment and Conservation 2008). Specifically this work needs to address reducing the amount of vertebrate by-catch, lessen the level of distress associated with vertebrate captures and, improve the scientific value of vertebrate by-catch. Although there has been some work examining design techniques of wet pit-fall traps to reduce by-catch(e.g. Pearce et al. 2005) and some preliminary examination of physical effects of low specific gravity non irritant fluids to reduce the time taken for by-catch to reach death(Burbidge 2004), there has been no work to improve the scientific value of vertebrate by-catch.</p>",<p>The desired outcome is to develop a chemical alternative to the glycol solutions used in invertebrate wet pitfall trapping that reduces the ethical dilemma that currently exist in relation to vertebrate by-catch and to ensure improved scientific value of vertebrate by-catch. The specific benefits to DEC will be through the ability to continue to use invertebrate wet pitfall trapping for biogeographic survey and biodiversity monitoring.</p>,,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,
371,"<p>The Great Western Woodlands (GWW) is an internationally significant area with great biological and cultural richness (Judd et al. 2008, Watson et al. 2008). This 16M ha region of south-western Australia arguably comprises the largest and most intact area of contiguous temperate woodland remaining on Earth. The Western Australian Government’s policy is to “better manage and protect the Great Western Woodlands and to ensure the long-term conservation of the unique natural and cultural values of this important wilderness area”. This led to the development of a conservation strategy (DEC 2010), co-ordinated by the Department of Environment and Conservation. The GWW Conservation Strategy and a review conducted by a wide range of scientists with expertise in the region (Prober et al. in press) each identified inappropriate fire regimes as a threat to the woodlands and emphasised the need for a science-based fire management regime for the area. Critical gaps in the knowledge of fire ecology for GWW woodland ecosystems are a major hindrance for ecological fire management in the region. </p>
<p>The GWW supports eucalypt woodlands at very low mean annual rainfall (250-350 mm), which require fire to establish but are very slow growing. In recent decades a large part of the GWW has been burnt (Parsons and Gosper 2011) and concern has been expressed over the ecological impacts of this (DEC 2010; Prober et al. in press). Fire ecology research already undertaken in Eastern Wheatbelt Nature Reserves by a joint DEC (BCI)-CSIRO project will help resolve ecological fire management issues for mallee and mallee-heath communities in the GWW (Parsons and Gosper 2011; Gosper et al. in press), but similar information for the dominant eucalypt woodlands is urgently needed. Recent work has described historical fire intervals experienced by major plant communities in the GWW and the role of landscape features and fuels in influencing fire spread (O’Donnell et al. 2011).</p>","<p>Fire is an important process in GWW ecosystems, but inappropriate fire regimes could have a large negative impact on the region’s biodiversity. Application of ecologically appropriate fire management in the region is a significant operational and scientific challenge. Progress is being made in this area, but it is acknowledged that a lack of information on the fire ecology of the dominant woodland ecosystems is a limiting factor. The project will deliver results that can be used by DEC Regional Services staff in fire management planning which will benefit the outstanding natural values of the GWW.</p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

374,"<p>Mangrove forests are composed of specialized plants that have range of morphological and physiological adaptations which allow them to inhabit the saline, waterlogged sediments of intertidal areas of marine and estuarine environments. Mangroves are subjected to extreme fluctuations in physical conditions (e.g. heat stress, desiccation, salinity) as a result of tidal movement. Mangroves form highly productive forests along sheltered, sedimentary coasts and estuaries where the structural complexity provided by mangrove trees and roots assist in sediment accumulation and trapping detritus (Nagelkerken et al. 2008). The concentration of plant debris within mangrove systems may support a high abundance of detritus-feeding and herbivorous fauna. Burrowing invertebrates, such as crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs, inhabit these sediments, while sessile organisms, such as algae and sponges, settle on the substrate provided by roots. Larger fauna, such as fish and reptiles, commonly enter mangrove habitats on flooding tides to utilise the food and shelter they provide. </p>
<p>Mangrove forests have an important ecological function in coastal systems through stabilizing sediments and buffering coastlines from wave energy. In addition, mangroves play a role in primary production and nutrient cycling in coastal systems and may provide critical habitat for fisheries resources although the significance of this function may vary depending on the proximity of other habitats (Dorenbosch et al. 2004; Ewel et al. 1998; Zann 1996).</p>
<p>The global loss of mangrove habitat is occurring at an alarming rate, and despite recent reductions in the rate of loss, estimates suggest that as much as 25% of original mangrove cover has been lost as a direct result of human activity (Spalding et al. 2010). Much of this loss is a direct result of coastal development, pollution and land-clearing and reclamation for aquaculture. In addition, dredging and the construction of coastal defense structures can indirectly alter local hydrodynamics and lead to mangrove losses. Given the pressures placed on mangroves at a global scale, the local management and conservation of mangrove forests is imperative. </p>
<p>Worldwide, there are 73 species of mangrove that cover approximately 152 000 square kilometers (Spalding et al. 2010). Mangroves are most diverse in tropical areas, but a relatively smaller number of species extend into cool temperate latitudes. Mangroves in Australia are distributed from Bunbury in Western Australia across the northern part of the continent and along the entire east coast to South Australia. In total, Australia has 39 species of mangrove, with the diversity dramatically decreasing with increasing latitude (Zann 1996). For example, In Western Australia extensive mangrove stands extend south to Shark Bay, but the diversity decreases from 13 species in the Kimberley to only one (Avicennia marina) in Shark Bay. </p>
<p>The Shark Bay marine protected areas, which comprise the Shark Bay Marine Park (SBMP) (748 725 ha) and the Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve (132 000 ha), are located on the midwest coast of Western Australia (WA) and within the Shark Bay World Heritage Area (Figure 1) (CALM 1996). The World Heritage listing of Shark Bay derived in part from a range of outstanding marine conservation values, including the Hamelin Pool stromatolites, extensive seagrass meadows and the high biodiversity of the region due to its location in a zone of temperate and tropical transition (Thomson-Dans 2008). Shark Bay’s two semi-enclosed gulfs also provide a range of shallow and sheltered marine habitats that are markedly different to the adjacent typically exposed and high-energy coast.</p>
<p>The SBMP supports numerous stands of the white mangrove Avicennia marina, which are recognized as high value conservation assets (CALM 1996) These mangroves represent the southern-most substantial concentration of this species on the WA coast (Semeniuk 1993), although smaller isolated stands of A. marina occur further south in WA, at the Abrolhos Islands (ca 28º S) and in the Leschenault Estuary (ca 33º S). The Shark Bay mangroves are patchily distributed, with substantial and dense stands occurring only at some locations on the Wooramel coast, Faure Island, the Peron Peninsula and in the vicinity of South Passage. These dense mangroves occur as fringing beach vegetation, along lagoon channels and within tidal flats created by accreting sand banks (Fig. 1), and display a wide variety of morphologies. These range from stands comprising tall (&gt;5m) trees in well established old forests, to stands comprising densely packed trees that appear to be stunted forms (Fig. 2), a condition which is not unusual in arid-zone mangroves (Alongi et al. 2005; Bhat et al. 2004; Naidoo 2010). </p>
<p>Current knowledge about the morphological structure of mangroves in this area is low. This project will map and quantify the variation in mangrove stand morphology across a range of spatial scales. This description will include an examination of both sediment and water characteristics of a number of stands across Shark Bay, and a description of the trees in stands (e.g. density, mean height, tree diameter etc.). </p>

<p>Fig. 2 Morphological variation in mangrove stands in Shark Bay. The image on the left shows large mature trees from Blind Inlet, the image on the right shows small, possibly stunted trees on the Wooramel coast. </p>","<p>Currently, management-related knowledge of mangroves in the SBWHA is low, and given the potential local threats to mangroves in the area, there is an urgent need to increase our understanding of this habitat. This study will provide the first quantitative knowledge concerning the structural diversity of mangrove stands in the SBWHA. The results of this project will then be used as a basis for future research projects examining a range of issues such as: the importance of mangroves in determining spatial and temporal patterns in associated assemblages such as fish, sharks, turtles and birds; the contribution of mangroves to primary productivity in the SBWHA; and, the broader ecological role of mangroves in nutrient cycling. This will aid in the management of the SBWHA through identifying areas of high diversity and conservation significance.   </p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,
415,"<p>The focus of work for Pluto LNG Project Offset “d” is on implementing research and monitoring that is consistent with the State Government’s indicative management plan (IMP) for the Proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area (See Figure 1). As outlined in Section 7 of the IMP, while some aspects of the marine biodiversity in the proposed reserves is relatively well understood, knowledge about environmental processes and existing pressures on values of these reserves is limited. Management strategies for scientific activity within the proposed reserves include the implementation of programs to provide for monitoring and assessment of ecological processes and the levels of human impacts. Section 8.4 of the IMP outlines generic research objectives, strategies and targets, with the overarching objective of obtaining an appropriate understanding of the biodiversity and key ecological and social processes within the proposed reserves. This section also aims to promote research that improves knowledge of the reserve and the technical basis for management decisions. Similarly, section 8.5 addresses monitoring of the key ecological values at risk in, and the human usage of, the proposed reserves. It also aims to promote ecological and social monitoring that will detect changes to ecological values to inform management.</p>
<p>Pluto LNG Project Offset “d” involves a suite of four inter-related projects which are:</p>
<p>(i)      Review, assess and summarise historical data relevant to the management of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;</p>
<p>(ii)     Determine distribution, patterns and key processes of major marine communities and large marine fauna of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;</p>
<p>(iii)    Describe patterns and trends in human use in the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area; and</p>
<p>(iv)    Establish long-term monitoring reference sites in the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area.</p>
<p>Large amounts of marine environmental and social data have been collected by a range of agencies and industry in this area since the late 1970s. This data was collected as part of industry development approvals processes, post-approval compliance monitoring programs, State and Commonwealth Government marine research and monitoring programs, university research programs and community projects. This project concentrates on project (i) of the four projects listed above and will identify, assess and collate existing datasets in relation to the marine biodiversity and human use of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area. This information will be used to establish long-term monitoring sites, enabling assessment of trends in biodiversity asset condition, pressures acting on these assets, and the efficiency and effectiveness of management responses to these pressures. Data will be incorporated into a marine information management system to secure future access to all information (i.e. ‘one-stop shop’ approach).</p>","<p>This project will provide an improved understanding for government, industry and the local community of historical trends in marine biodiversity asset condition and human use of this region, and the effectiveness of past management programs. It will also identify existing and potential issues and risks where future management action may be needed.</p>
<p>Consistent with the IMP, this project will provide the information, and a scientific platform, to drive future research and monitoring programs in the Dampier Archipelago area, and facilitate planning and implementation of the remaining Pluto LNG Project Offset “d” projects. Outputs and information generated through this project will further benefit regional managers through the provision of both contextual and technical information to aid in the development of coastal and marine management programs. This project will also seek to formalise and refine the methodology to construct historical time-series datasets developed by the Marine Science Program, and link in with procedures established through the Department of Environment and Conservation Science Division, Marine Science Program Information Management Strategic Plan 2011-2014 (Mayer et al. in prep).</p>
<p>Given the nature of this project it is likely that some aspects will continue through the life of the Pluto LNG Project Offset ‘D’ program. Although historical time-series data will be prepared within the allotted time period of project (i), acquisition and/or further processing of some data may be required. The final project report will include details of the work that has been completed, as well as recommendations on any further data acquisition or processing that may be of benefit.</p>

376,"<p>The northern quoll, Dasyurus hallucatus, is the smallest of all Australian quolls (300 – 1000g) and is restricted to five regional populations across Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, both on the mainland and offshore islands. The species distribution has declined gradually over the last 50 years with a number of threats, either directly or in combination with each other, thought to be contributing to the species decline. Threats include mortality caused by poisoning from cane toads, inappropriate fire regimes (and predation by introduced animals after fire) and the removal, degradation and fragmentation of habitat as a result of development actions, mining activities and pastoralism. The northern quoll is listed as a threatened (‘Endangered’) species under the Commonwealth’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. A recovery plan has been prepared (Hill and Ward 2010), and the research proposed is consistent with the actions of this plan.</p>
<p>Northern quolls occupy a variety of habitats across their current range including rocky areas, eucalypt forest and woodlands, rainforests, sandy lowlands and beaches, shrublands, grasslands and desert. Habitat usually requires some form of rocky area or structurally diverse woodland/forest for denning and shelter purposes with surrounding vegetated habitats used for foraging and dispersal. Northern quolls are a highly mobile species with home ranges in the northern parts of their range known to cover 100 ha or more. They reproduce once per year and have on average seven young. Many of the males and females have only a short lifespan, surviving for one breeding season. However where resources are more abundant some males and females will survive into their second or even third breeding season.</p>
<p>Little is known about northern quolls in the Pilbara region of WA. Most information on the demographics, biology and ecology of this species comes from studies conducted in the Kimberley, Northern Territory or Queensland (Begg, 1981; Schmitt et al., 1989; Braithwaite &amp; Griffith, 1994; Oakwood, 1997 &amp; 2000). These studies have highlighted differences in the northern quoll’s ecology between regions and populations and a need to address the gaps in our knowledge of the species in the Pilbara.  Genetic studies indicate a primary genetic division between Western Australian populations (Kimberley and Pilbara) and Northern Territory / Queensland populations of the northern quoll (How et al. 2009).  These authors further show that there is also marked genetic divergence between the Kimberley and Pilbara populations, and identify the Great Sandy Desert as a substantial and long standing barrier to gene flow.</p>","<ul>

379,"<p>Ocean-warming events have recently received much attention and are responsible for a significant global decline in both coral cover and diversity over the past two decades (Wilkinson et al. 1999; Wilkinson 2008). Interaction between high incident light and increased temperature induces a breakdown in the complex host-symbiont relationship, and subsequent loss of the pigment-containing symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) and resultant bleaching of the coral tissue (Glynn 1996, Fitt et al. 2001). In many instances corals are able to withstand these heat and light stresses and either recolonise or recruit zooxanthellae to the colony to effect recovery (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999). In acute instances where the heat/light stress exceeds physiological thresholds by a large margin, corals die. The spatial consequences of the heat/light stressor complex vary according to the magnitude of climatological forcing with impacts scaling from highly localised species-specific events (Fitt &amp; Warner 1995) to ocean-basin region bleaching in anomalous extreme years (e.g. Goreau et al. 2000; Obura 2005).</p>
<p>In the past two decades, the documentation of coral bleaching on large (100s kms) to very large (1000s kms) scales has been increasing (Goreau &amp; Hayes 1994, Berkelmans et al. 2004). It is uncertain as to whether this represents an accelerated rate in the extent and intensity of these events or whether the documentation is reaching critical mass. What is however becoming increasingly certain is that continued increases in discharge of atmospheric pollutants is causing inexorable rates of change to coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation cycles (Caldeira &amp; Wickett 2005, Solomon et al 2009). This will likely drive up rates of incidence of temperature and related climate-driven stressors on coral reefs (Hoeke et al. 2011). The predicted impact to reef-building corals will be that deleterious physiological impacts, most notably coral bleaching, will become more widespread and severe leading to a loss of critical ecosystem resources through decreased coral community diversity (Bruno &amp; Selig 2007, Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007, Carpenter et al. 2008).</p>
<p>Western Australian reefs have been considered relatively resilient to coral bleaching events. Following strong El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) anomalies in 1998 there has previously been significant bleaching and recovery at Scott Reef (Smith et al. 2008, Halford and Caley 2009) and there are anecdotal reports of coral bleaching at other locations (Goreau et al. 2000). However there is no documentation of widespread coral bleaching along the WA coastline. In the summer of 2010-2011 abnormally warm water is reported to have caused extensive bleaching along the western coast of Australia. Information on coral communities gathered by DEC, DoF CSIRO and AIMS provides an opportunity to comprehensively assess the impact of this warm water anomaly on coral communities through assessments of how much coral was bleached across 11<sup>o</sup> of latitude. The implications for coral reefs are explored by quantifying the spatial patterns in bleaching and subsequent post-bleaching mortality rates of corals with reference to local and regional estimates of water temperature.</p>",,,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,
381,"<p>This project was initiated in 2003 as a collaboration between Stephen Hopper, then CEO Kings Park, and Paul Gioia, then Senior Research Scientist at WA Herbarium, DEC. The intention was to investigate the use of Herbarium specimen data in exploring patterns of plant biodiversity within Western Australia. While some studies had investigated various aspects of plant biodiversity (Lesueur, Perth, Stirling Range, Fitzgerald River, and western wheatbelt - see Brown, 1832; Diels, 1906; Speck, 1958; Hopper, 1979; Gibson et al., 1997; Hopper &amp; Burbidge, 1990), none had used the Herbarium collection or employed the latest technology to analyse all available data across a broad scale.</p>

382,"<p>The Earth’s biota is facing profound risks of damaging climate change during this century. This is due to steeply rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and positive feedbacks which reinforce and amplify human-caused global warming. Some degree of global warming is inevitable due to the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> already in the atmosphere. Thus, to protect biota, effective climate change adaptation strategies are now required.</p>
<p>Many taxa have survived past regional climate changes by contracting to dispersed refuges characterised by features that ameliorate climate impacts. Such refuges will likely contribute to the persistence of species and ecological communities under anthropogenic global warming. The identification and management of climate refugia is therefore a vital component of climate change adaptation strategies.</p>
<p>In Australia, the south-western Australian (SWWA) global biodiversity hotspot is already experiencing climate change attributed in part to global warming, and there are predictions for further warming and drying in the area. This old, highly weathered and flat landscape offers little scope for the biota to migrate to altitudinal refuges. However, the landscape is characterised by numerous granite outcrops and inselbergs scattered across the mesic to semi-arid rainfall gradient. These minor variations in topographic complexity may serve to ameliorate the impacts of climate change for the flora of this hotspot.</p>
<p>Identifying the characteristics and occurrence in landscapes of potential climate refuges is a key international climate change research agenda that requires transdisciplinary approaches in the ecological, evolutionary and spatial sciences. In this project we use a transdisciplinary approach to understand past dispersal and contraction of species and scalar relationships with regional landscape components to contribute to developing effective Climate Change Integrated Conservation Strategies.</p>","<p>By identifying areas that can act as refugia under projected climate conditions, adaptation and conservation activities can be focused where they will provide greatest benefit. The many granite outcrops scattered across the mesic to semi-arid rainfall gradient of the region include over 17 % of the State’s vascular flora in less than 1 % of its area. We contribute to developing conservation strategies for outcrop flora by examining the evidence of granite outcrops as refugia and as reservoirs of genetic diversity. </p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,
384,"<p>The flora of Western Australia is inadequately known and insufficiently studied. Putative new taxa are discovered through survey, herbarium studies and by observant members of the public. Many of the new taxa so discovered are appropriately dealt with and formally described in the context of revisionary studies by specialist botanists in the Western Australian Herbarium and elsewhere in Australia and the world. Others, however, particularly putative new taxa in smaller genera or in genera for which there are no active revisionary studies, are in danger of being set aside – phrase-named – for a substantial period of time.</p>
<p>This Plan relates to occasional taxonomic studies in such poorly-served groups, arising on an as-needs basis. A typical scenario occurred with the discovery of two putative new taxa, one in <em>Banksia</em> and one in <em>Darwinia,</em> by DEC volunteers Fred &amp; Jean Hort. Morphological assessments confirmed that the species were clearly distinct, and they were formally described in single-species papers in <em>Nuytsia (Thiele,</em> 2009, 2010). Similar work has been done in a series of papers on the genus <em>Hibbertia</em> (Thiele 2009a,b; Thiele &amp; Wege 2009).</p>
<p>While the work under this plan often results in single-species papers rather than revisionary studies, it nevertheless contributes significantly to our knowledge of the Western Australian flora and reduces the likelihood of a taxon remaining phrase-named, with little supporting information or identification tools, for extended periods.</p>
<p>A second common scenario involves dealing with taxa that have been listed as phrase-named or manuscript names on the Census of Western Australian Plants for a considerable period with little ongoing activity, and to either remove them from the Census, with a Short Communication in Nuytsia, or to describe them as new. An example is <em>Epiblema grandiflorum var. cyaneum ms</em>, a putative new DRF taxon that has remained on the Census for many years despite evidence that it represents a mere colour variant of the colour-variable <em>E. grandiflorum</em>, and has been the subject of Recovery Planning expenditures and management efforts. Following assessment, this taxon was removed from the Census (Thiele &amp; Brown, 2011) and hence removed from Department funding priorities.</p>","<ul>

385,"<p>With over 350 taxa in Western Australia's Southwest Botanical Province, the family Ericaceae (formerly segregated as Epacridaceae) is the fifth largest within a region that is globally recognised as a hotspot of botanical diversity (e.g. Myers et al. 2000). In common with Fabaceae, Myrtaceae and Proteaceae, the three dicot families with still greater numbers in the SWBP, Ericaceae includes many narrow-range endemics (Hopper &amp; Gioia 2004).</p>
<p>Ongoing taxonomic research into the three largest Western Australian genera within the family, <em>Leucopogon</em> R.Br., <em>Andersonia R.Br.</em> and <em>Astroloma</em> R.Br., indicates that all include significant numbers of undescribed taxa (c. 80, 20 &amp; 10 respectively), many of which are regional or local endemics. The figure for <em>Leucopogon</em> includes members of both <em>Leucopogon</em> s. str. and of the several taxonomic elements that currently comprise <em>Leucopogon s. lat.</em> Of the more than 200 Leucopogon taxa (formal and informal names) now listed on FloraBase (Western Australian Herbarium 1998-), the balance between sens. str. and sens. lat. is close to 50/50.</p>
<p>Work on a phylogenetically-based generic framework in the <em>Styphelia-Astroloma _clade (described above) of tribe Styphelieae will result in the recognition of several new genera and/or a much expanded circumscription of the genus _Styphelia.</em> This will then allow the process to begin of formally describing the numerous phrase-named taxa currently in <em>Leucopogon s. lat.</em> Many of these are of high conservation significance. In another part of the tribe <em>Styphelieae</em> the well-supported clade <em>Leucopogon s. str</em>. also includes numerous unnamed taxa.</p>
<p>An informal infrageneric classification within the genus was installed by Hislop &amp; Chapman (2007) which provided a framework within which new species could be added in a systematic way. A total of 13 new taxa have been described since that publication, 9 of which are conservation-coded (refer Hislop 2008, Hislop 2009a &amp; Hislop 2009b). Keys have also been provided for two of the five informal groups. Elsewhere in <em>Styphelieae</em> two new species and a new combination have been published in the genus <em>Acrotriche</em> (Hislop 2007 &amp; Hislop 2010), one of these species has recently been nominated for DRF status.                      </p>","<ul>

<p>Apart from the Salinity Action Plan Wheatbelt Biological Survey and Monitoring Program (Pinder et al. 2004) little information was available on the vast numbers of wetlands in the Avon NRM region. This project partially filled this gap by providing an inventory of the wetlands in the region, with up to date mapping and classification of wetlands into groups based on hydrology, landform and other physical characteristics. It also provided a broad-scale evaluation of the conservation significance of basin and granite outcrop wetlands to enable strategic catchment planning in the region.</p>","<ol>
<li>Knowledge of the number, type, location and significance of wetlands in the Avon NRM region. The wetland mapping GIS shapefile, with wetland boundaries attributed for landscape setting, typology and stage 1 (remote sensed) conservation status assessment, will assist DEC staff with a variety of wetland and catchment management tasks and prioritization of conservation actions. These layers have already contributed to a regional conservation planning program run by Avon NRM and DEC.</li>
<li>A method for conducting detailed on-ground (stage 3) assessments of the conservation significance of wetlands in the Avon NRM region. This will provide regional DEC officers with standardised conservation significance assessments and provide an endorsed method for drainage proponents to follow.</li>
<li>The literature review of potential effects (and knowledge gaps) of agricultural drainage water discharge on the biota of Avon NRM wetlands will aid assessment of drainage proposals by DEC staff.</li>
<li>Data on aquatic invertebrates, water chemistry and waterbirds for 92 wetlands in the region, with floristic data for some of these. This adds to knowledge of aquatic biodiversity patterning in the region.</li>

388,"<p>There have been several regional scale surveys of aquatic invertebrates in Western Australia, including the Warren region (Horwitz 1994), the Southern Carnarvon Basin (Halse et al. 2000), the Wheatbelt (Pinder et al. 2004) and the Pilbara (Pinder et al. 2010a). While these larger scale surveys provide analyses of biodiversity patterning for regional-scale conservation planning, sites are usually too sparse for more local scale planning. However, the larger surveys can be used to identify subregions of high biodiversity (such as Biodiversity Recovery Catchments in the Wheatbelt), which then require more detailed survey for local conservation planning. In the Wheatbelt smaller scale aquatic invertebrate surveys have been carried out in the Drummond (Pinder et al. 2011), Buntine-Marchagee (Aquatic Research Laboratory 2009), Bryde (Cale et al. 2008) and Muir-Unicup (A. Storey [UWA] and DEC unpublished) Recovery Catchments. Another of the Walshe et al. (2004) potential recovery catchments, the Hutt Lagoon/Hutt River Catchments, was similarly surveyed for aquatic invertebrates by Quinlan et al. (2009). Each of these smaller scale surveys have informed conservation planning, such as setting biodiversity targets (e.g. Drummond Nature Reserve and Lake Toolibin), prioritization of conservation actions (Buntine-Marchagee) and planning and monitoring engineering works (e.g. by providing baseline data, e.g. Bryde and Warden wetlands). There is a strong overlap with some of the smaller aquatic invertebrate monitoring work that has been undertaken where the monitoring is for wetlands with few other data – so the monitoring data also provides information on biodiversity patterning. This is the case for mound springs east of Eneabba (Pinder and Leung 2010) and the Lake Warden wetlands (Pinder et al. 2010b) and I suggest that these small scale (and intermittent) monitoring projects be run under this SPP).</p>","<p>Knowledge of the distribution of species and composition of communities has a myriad of benefits to DEC’s core conservation work. Data collected to date has been used as baselines for monitoring management actions, prioritization of wetland conservation actions based on invertebrate community composition, identification of threatened ecological communities and assessment of species conservation status and setting biodiversity targets (see ‘background’ above). Some of this data has also been used for environmental impact assessment. Much of this data has also been provided to external researchers and students for separate projects that also have direct benefit for DEC.</p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

391,"<p>The Department of Environment and Conservation (with the assistance of the WA Museum) has a long-standing commitment to undertaking regional biogeographic surveys of the State.

These surveys have underpinned the selection of areas for the conservation reserve system, provided information to determine conservation status of species and filled significant gaps in biodiversity knowledge. While these large scale surveys provide analyses of biodiversity patterning for regional-scale conservation planning, sites are usually too sparse and often lack detail at finer scales.

<p>Current forest regeneration practice is governed by the Forest Management Plan 2014-2023 that provides for seed sourcing from land management units adjacent to the site based on a broad interpretation of local provenance in widespread semi-continuous species.

<p>Marri (<em>Corymbia calophylla</em>) is an important component of the forest ecosystem providing nesting hollows and a food source for endangered cockatoo species. In addition to being an important timber tree, the fruit, seeds, flowers, leaves and wood of marri are all important sources of food for native fauna. The seeds are a major food source for nationally listed threatened birds (Baudin&rsquo;s black cockatoo and Carnaby&rsquo;s black cockatoo) and the maintenance of habitat and food resources is a key factor in forest management practice.

<p>31 Dec 2012</p>","<p>Landscape-scale restoration of over-cleared, multi-use landscapes can only be achieved through revegetation. This typically includes planting of indigenous native plant species, sometimes in combination with native or exotic perennials for production or carbon sequestration.  In each of these cases investments will be wasted and goals will not be achieved if plantings are not resilient to climate change. One of the few significant avenues for increasing the success of landscape-scale restoration is to increase climate resilience through use of appropriate genetic stock. By investigating patterns of adaptive variation in widespread eucalypts of eastern and western Australian agricultural landscapes, this project will pioneer the development of new approaches to sourcing genetic stock for climate-resilient revegetation, applicable at the national scale. Initial guidelines will be available on completion of the project. Ongoing studies and entrenchment of a new genetic paradigm for restoration may be achieved over a five to ten year timeframe, assuming further funding becomes available. Direct benefits will arise through improved long-term success of investments in revegetation and other plantings across Australia.</p>","<p>Multi-million dollar investments in maintenance of ecosystem function through restoration of Australia’s degraded and fragmented multi-use landscapes currently take little account of climate change. Until recently there has been a strong focus on maintaining local genetic patterns for optimal restoration. In a changing climate this paradigm will no longer be relevant.</p>
<p>This project offers a novel and exciting approach to the challenging task of identifying adaptation strategies to maximise resilience to climate change. In particular it will pioneer research at the interface between molecular genetics, plant physiology and ecological adaptation in the emerging field of ecological genomics, where there is significant untapped potential for major developments in climate change adaptation research. It will apply new genomic tools to identify adaptive capacity in eucalypts that will drive development of adaptation strategies for eucalypt dominated ecosystems across Australia. Investigation of assisted migration for maintenance of ecological function is a challenging topic that was identified as a critical component of climate adaptation strategies at a recent NCCARF workshop. It extends the concept of assisted migration for preservation of single species to the ecosystem scale. It will be important to investigate the potential for this level of intervention in landscape scale adaptation strategies.</p>
<p>The project will test the following alternative hypotheses: 1. Widespread species, having evolved under highly variable environments, retain high potential for adaptability to environmental change within the gene pool of local populations or individuals (implying that genetic material sourced from local populations will have tolerance to changing climatic conditions). 2. Widespread species, having evolved across wide ecological gradients, comprise a suite of locally adapted sub-populations each (implying that genetic material should be sourced not from local populations but from distant and potentially resilient populations which are pre-adapted to the future climate).</p>","[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

411,"<p>The south-west Australian floristic region is recognized as one of only 34 global biodiversity hotspots: those regions on earth richest in endemic species under threat. Approximately 2000 of a total of 8000 plant species in southwest Australia occur on granite outcrops or other shallow-soil environments (Hopper et al., 1997; Hopper and Gioia, 2004). Many of these species are shallow-soil endemics that have a highly fragmented and often restricted distribution. Also worldwide a large number of rare species occur in open, shallow, rocky and drought-prone environments. This suggests that shallow-soil endemics may have special adaptations to their own habitats that prevent them from establishing and being competitive in others.</p>","<p>The below mentioned outcomes summarize the conclusions on the research that I have done in this area so far, including material from as yet unpublished data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revegetation/replanting of perennial vegetation in shallow-soil communities can only be expected to be successful when there are cracks ‘available’ to the plants’ roots in the underlying rock. This may only be the case after fire or after the death of mature individuals. Also, relatively bare areas with low native vegetation cover are unlikely to be useful for revegetation purposes (i.e. they are bare for a reason: low water supply). </li>
<li>Using glasshouse grown seedlings with relatively few and often stunted and air pruned roots may be especially problematic for revegetation purposes on shallow soils. A high investment in roots appears essential for first summer survival and glasshouse grown seedlings often have much higher shoot to root ratios.</li>
<li>Watering over summer may greatly increase survival of transplanted shallow-soil endemics as individuals that did not reach cracks with sufficient water supply before summer get another chance. However, long term establishment will be dependent on obtaining a more permanent access to a water supply</li>

412,"<p>Many full or interim recovery plans of DRF in WA have involved translocation of nursery-grown plants. Although some of these translocations have been successful others have been more problematic. The reasons for either failure or success have sometimes been unclear. In many cases more detailed information is needed to be able to accurately determine the likelihood of both short term success, by understanding factors critical for initial establishment and reaching reproductive maturity, and long term success in terms of recruitment and establishing a viable population. The proposed translocations involve a collaboration with UWA (through the PhD student Christine Allen and a shared position with UWA Plant Biology) to further improve our understanding of seedling establishment, growth and survival by examining several factors in an experimental setup.

419,"<p>The contribution of canker fungi to stem and branch death in South Western Australia has largely been ignored (Davison &amp; Tay 1983, Shearer 1992). Past records have shown that two days with temperatures over 40ºC and high winds was associated with rapid extension of <em>Botryosphaeria _sp. lesions in _Banksia speciosa _leading to the death of affected trees near Hopetoun (Shearer 1994). Since 1994 there has been a steady increase in canker reports and samples received for identification particularly in the declared rare flora _Banksia verticillata</em>, <em>B.brownii _as well as non threatened taxa such as _B. baxteri, B. coccinea</em>, and <em>B. sessilis</em>. South Coast Regional staff have expressed concern that many of the natural populations of <em>B. anatona, B. verticillata</em> and <em>Lambertia orbifolia</em> spp. <em>orbifolia</em> (including a translocated population) DRF appear to be succumbing to canker by degrees. Families outside the Proteaceae are also impacted, eg. _Acacia accuminatus _and _Calothamnus quadrifidus _are also recorded as having high rates of branch and stem cankers (Pathogen of the month 2007, DEC records).</p>
<p>Observation and increase in sample numbers suggests that the incidence and severity of these events is increasing which indicates a shift in the host/pathogen/environment disease triangle has occurred. As the hosts are endemic and the pathogens also appear endemic this leaves environmental change as the likely reason for the change in impact. Quantification of canker incidence and severity requires semi permanent transects to be established and monitored across the region and compared simultaneously with climatic data.</p>
<p>Direct therapy for the affected hosts is one management option available within a holistic disease management strategy. As Denman (2004) has been able to show reduced canker activity with application of several fungicides in <em>Protea magnifica _in the field it is quite likely that these fungicides will be capable of reducing impact of cankers in affected species particularly _B. verticillata</em> and_ L. orbifolia _in the South Coast of Western Australia.</p>","<p>Predictive capacity of canker impact in Proteaceae with temperature increases.

<p>Does burning for vegetation carbon storage increase resilience of the vulnerable tree rat Conilurus penicillatus? </p>
<p>Supervisor: Professor Michael Lawes, Charles Darwin University</p>
<p>PhD study to test whether threatened mammals benefit from low intensity prescribed fires. Conilurus penicillatus is a tree rat species that is declining over much of its range. This species has recently been reclassified as vulnerable. A major threat is current fire regimes. This project will aim to re-establish fine-grain fire mosaics approximating traditional fire regimes, protecting and enhancing native vegetation in the North Kimberley, in the last refuges for this species. Areas with prescribed burning will be compared with unmanaged areas, to show the benefits of mosaic-burning, both for biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Conilurus provides an indicator of savanna health and adds value to existing biodiversity monitoring programs.</p>
<p>Can increases in dingo numbers increase vegetation biomass and threatened mammal populations? Role of keystone predators</p>
<p>Supervisor: Professor Chris Dickman, University of Sydney</p>
<p>Dingoes are thought to have positive benefits to Australian ecosystems. To date, no use has been made of dingoes for conservation purposes.</p>
<p>This study will investigate two putative benefits of dingoes highlighted by recent research. The first is that dingoes can increase vegetation biomass (and carbon storage) by reducing the intensity of grazing by herbivores including macropods. The second is that dingoes can reduce impacts of predation by cats and foxes on threatened mammals in north Kimberley savanna ecosystems. In this study, dingo numbers will be manipulated by changing their resource base (irrigation) and by fencing. Dingo ecosystem effects will be tested by measuring plant biomass/structure and through a mammal trapping program.</p>
<p>Fine-grained mosaic burning for enhancing threatened gouldian finch food resources and grass carbon storage</p>
<p>Supervisors: Professor Michael Lawes, Charles Darwin University</p>
<p>Dr Sarah Pryke, Macquarie University/Australian National University</p>
<p>The endangered Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) is threatened by frequent, extensive, high intensity fire regimes in northern Australia. Perennial grass seed limitation is thought to result in wet season seed famine and to limit survival of finches in frequently burnt savannas. This project seeks to identify best on-ground burning actions for protection of grass seed resources in known Gouldian finch feeding areas in the East Kimberley region. This will have added benefits for carbon storage within vegetation. The student project would quantify on-ground seed availability and gouldian finch feeding patterns under different fire management to determine if on-ground fire management can benefit this threatened species.</p>

1489,"<p>This project forms part of the Strategic Planning for Sustainable Mosaic Agriculture project (SPSMA) which is itself a component of the Department&nbsp;of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (DAFWA)&nbsp; Beef Futures Program. The SPSMA project will explore&nbsp;opportunities to expand the potential of beef&nbsp;production systems in the Kimberley, Western Australia with the expansion of mosaic&nbsp;agriculture around irrigation&nbsp;precincts and improved rainfed forage systems. One of the areas requiring clarity for the development of mosaic agriculture is a perception of uncertainty about the potential for and risk of using&nbsp;alien (introduced) pastoral species, particularly on land held under pastoral lease.</p>
<p>A novel&nbsp;environmental risk strategy and weed risk assessment (WRA) protocol was developed for the Future Farm Industries Cooperative&nbsp;Research Centre (FFI CRC) by the managing Weed and Genetic Risk Project in the Department of Parks and Wildlife. The WRA was designed to assess the potential level of risk that agriculturally-useful pasture (and woody) species might pose to intact natural vegetation in southern Australia. This protocol and framework will be developed assess the potential weed risk of growing non-indigenous&nbsp;plants in the rangelands of WA and revised to reflect current&nbsp;best practice. Some agriculturally useful species have the potential to become weeds of natural environments and, if established may be expensive or impossible to&nbsp;eradicate or control. Preventing the introduction of very hight risk species is most economical and provides better environmental protection that attempts to control or eradicate environmental weeds, once established.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Kimberley region of Western Australia is undergoing economic, social and agricultural development. It also includes large areas under the care and responsibility of the Department of Parks and Wildlife, has been identified as a biodiversity&nbsp;hot spot and contains many&nbsp;endemic species and unique, rare and&nbsp;often&nbsp;fragmented ecosystems. The&nbsp;outcomes from this project will provide information which can be used in the&nbsp;consideration of these, sometimes competing, land use requirements.</p>
<p>Within the SPSAM project the WRAs will inform the selection of&nbsp;species for research and&nbsp;recommendation with, where appropriate,&nbsp;management guidelines to help minimise any risk to&nbsp;natural environments. One of the areas requiring clarity for the development of mosaic agriculture is a perception of&nbsp;uncertainty about the potential for and risk of using introduced (alien) pastoral species, particularly on land held under pastoral lease. Individual WRAs and&nbsp;management guides will be published on the DAFWA website and provide information for all stakeholders, decision&nbsp;making agencies and the wider public.</p>

This guide will provide information to help land managers minimise the risk to natural environments and information on control and eradication.</p>

<p>An important part of the project is to provide information&nbsp;about the ERS and the WRA process as widely as possible.

441,"<p>Human-mediated landscape disturbance can affect the amount of genetic diversity present in populations of threatened species and its distribution across the landscape. One challenge facing conservation managers is understanding how management tools can be used to protect and facilitate genetic patterns and processes, as much as demographic ones. For example, reserve design principles (comprehensiveness, adequacy, representativeness (CAR); single large or several small (SLOSS)) can be just as well applied to conserve genetic diversity as species diversity. Genetic approaches can be used to investigate patterns of contemporary and historical diversity and to understand how best to conserve the processes that generate these patterns.</p>","<p>It is increasingly recognized that conserving species genetic diversity is integral to facilitating species persistence under multiple threats, including predicted climate change. Genetic information when combined with landscape and environmental data provides a powerful tool for conservation planning, including reserve design and prioritisation. These projects will provide insight into the distribution of genetic diversity across a range of species and how the reserve system acts to protect the patterns and processes that generate this diversity. </p>","<p>Quenda</p>

444,"<p>The terrestrial vertebrate component of the Kingston Project (SPP 1993/115) employs a replicated BACI (Before, After, Control, Impact) design. Intensive field work was conducted 1994-2000. Timber-harvesting occurred in 1995-1996. Pit and Elliott trapping for small vertebrates ceased in 2000. Cage trapping to monitor medium-sized mammals has continued on about 4-yearly intervals (i.e. 2004/05 and 2009). In so doing, responses to timber harvesting has been quantified 1-2 years pre-harvesting, 1-2 years during harvesting disturbance and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 13 years post disturbance. Spotlight surveys to monitor less readily captured mammals, particularly ngwayir and koomal, have been conducted along three transects since 1996 and were particularly intensive in 1997-2000. Since 2004 6 surveys per annum have been sustained on each of the three transects.</p>
<p>This concept plan has been prepared to replace SPP 1993/115 and provide for completion of data analysis and publication of results for the period 1996 to 2011. This will be the immediate priority for work in 2012/13. Subject to confirmation that the experimental design is robust and can be extended, the study may be expanded to examine the response of vertebrates to harvesting of mature forest retained as exclusion strips during the 1996 operation. These strips are considered important in mediating the impact of timber harvesting on arboreal mammals and birds. Understanding how fauna will respond to a further harvest cycle in important in informing the current sustainable forest management objectives.</p>","<ul>

1752,"<p>The recognition of poorly defined success criteria and a lack of long term monitoring have highlighted the need for the development of post implementation empirical evaluations of the quality of restoration activities.&nbsp;This recognition has led to the hypothesis that the most ecologically and genetically viable restored populations will be those where reproductive outputs, plant pollinator interactions, levels of genetic diversity, mating systems and patterns of pollen dispersal most closely mimic those found in natural or undisturbed remnant vegetation. These populations are more likely to persist in the long term and contribute to effective ecosystem function through integration into the broader landscape. This project aims to assess the success of restoration in terms of ecological and genetic viability for plant species in the Fitzgerald River-Stirling Range region of Western Australia, where significant investment is being made in restoring connectivity at a landscape scale. The project intends to compare mating systems, genetic diversity and pollen dispersal in restored sites with those of undisturbed natural vegetation. Significantly, the project moves measures of restoration success beyond that of population establishment and survival to incorporate the evolutionary processes that provide long term resilience, persistence and functional integration of restored populations into broader landscapes.</p>","<p>A number of ecological and genetic assessments will be made for each of six target species (<em>Banksia media</em>, <em>Hakea nitida</em>, <em>Hakea laurina</em>, <em>Melaleuca acuminata</em>, <em>Eucalyptus occidentalis</em> and <em>Acacia cyclops</em>) at up to three Gondwana Link restoration sites established with differing seed and seedling establishment regimes and for differing lengths of time and in nearby natural remnant populations. Assessments will include,</p>
<ul>
<li>measures of reproductive output including seed viability and vigour,</li>
<li>levels of genetic diversity as measured by nuclear microsatellite markers,</li>

1498,"<p>The Dampier Archipelago is situated adjacent to Karratha, 1,650 km north of Perth in the Pilbara Nearshore marine bioregion. The marine and coastal environment of the Dampier Archipelago/Cape Preston Region has a complex structure of islands and supports diverse intertidal and subtidal habitats that include rocky reefs, corals, mangroves, macro-algae and soft sediments. The area is subject to increasing human pressures, including the development and expansion of several heavy industries that have required port infrastructure and dredging. The archipelago waters also support pearling and aquaculture and commercial and recreational fishing. High levels of private boat ownership in adjacent communities suggest that visitor use of this area is high.

Environmental Modelling and Software. doi: 10.1016/j.envsoft.2012.07.003.</p>","<p>Shrubland ecosystems are widespread in south-west Western Australia, and are the predominant vegetation type in coastal areas between Geraldton and Esperance. Coastal shrublands are renowned for their flammability, and fires can be fast moving and intense when dead fine fuels are dry and wind speeds exceed 15 km/h. A characteristic feature of fire behavior in shrublands is the abrupt and drastic escalation in fire behavior that takes place as fire transitions from the litter layer to the shrub canopy layer. The transition from surface to crown fire behavior is determined by fuel dryness, wind speed, and the structure and continuity of the vegetation itself (Cruz et al. 2012). This characteristic fire behavior makes shrublands a problematic fuel type in which to apply prescribed fire: if conditions are too mild then fire does not sustain and burn enough of the vegetation to create an effective fuel-reduced zone; at the other extreme, small changes in weather conditions can lead to fires burning with uncontrollable intensity.</p>
<p>Currently, DEC does not have a fire behavior guide specific to coastal shrublands. Practitioners must therefore rely on experience alone, or on predictions and indices adapted from fire behavior guides developed for other vegetation types such as forest, grassland or semi-arid mallee-heath.

326,"<p>At the request of the Executive Director, the Science Division has prepared a scoping document for a comprehensive biological survey of the Pilbara IBRA bioregion.&nbsp; The biota of the region is still poorly documented, despite a considerable amount of localised survey by government institutions and mining companies.&nbsp; This hampers assessment of the likely environmental impacts of many economically important development projects, as well as development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.&nbsp; New species of terrestrial plants and vertebrates, as well as very large numbers of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, are still being discovered in the Pilbara.&nbsp; In addition, the region has recently been shown to contain a very rich groundwater fauna, which has considerable conservation importance and a high degree of local endemism.</p>
<p>A regional biological survey will provide an overview of biodiversity in the region and a context for assessing the significance of localised occurrences of surface and groundwater species (see Burbidge et al. 2000).</p>
<p>Stygofauna has not previously been included in the broadscale biological survey program in Western Australia (eg Burbidge et al. 2000) but lack of information about stygofauna and its distribution in the Pilbara is hampering economically important resource development projects and making it difficult to assess their likely environmental impacts because of the large number of new species being discovered in impact statement surveys. The urgent need for a regional survey to provide a framework for decisions about the conservation and management of stygofauna was identified in Recommendation 1 of Dr Phillip Playford's recent review of stygofauna for the Environmental Protection Authority, as well as at recent workshops involving government and industry. Hatton and Evans (1998, p 2) concluded in their review of the groundwater systems in Australia for LWRRDC that ""virtually nothing is known &hellip; of biodiversity"", although worldwide there is a recognition that groundwater probably contains a greater array of freshwater species than surface waters (Gibert et al. 1994).</p>","<ul>

1510,"<p>Aquatic habitats in the south-west of WA are under increasing threat from changes in hydrology, water quality and fire as a result of the drying climate and historical and current land use. At present, there is an inadequate understanding of the responses of aquatic communities to these threats to inform the management of many aquatic systems in the Forest Management Plan area, including the Muir-Byenup Ramsar wetlands.</p>
<p>This project has two components:</p>
<p><em>Re-surveys of aquatic invertebrates in Muir-Byenup Ramsar wetlands sampled in 1994 and 2004 and suites of wetlands further south sampled in 1993. This addresses KPI3 of the 2014-23 FMP.</em></p>
<p>The FMP area has many high value wetlands, particularly in the Warren region. Some of these are listed as nationally or internationally significant and some are priorities in regional nature conservation plans. These support numerous priority flora species, priority ecological communities, significant waterbirds, 6 of the 8 species of south-west endemic fish and a very high diversity and endemicity of invertebrates. Threats to many of these wetlands have intensified over the last decade. The available biodiversity data is 10 to 20 year old and up to date information is required to assess responses to threats and inform the allocation of resources to management actions.</p>
<p><em>Continued monitoring of high condition streams, with a focus on effects of the drying climate and forest management. This addresses KPI1 of the 2014-23 FMP.</em></p>
<p>KPI20 of the previous FMP scored 24 of 51 monitored stream sites as impaired. This was not clearly related to forestry activities but could, in part, be related to reduced rainfall. This project would see continued monitoring at &lsquo;reference condition&rsquo; streams and those that already affected by reduced rainfall. A focus on these streams aligns with KPI1 of the current FMP which focuses on change in &lsquo;currently healthy ecosystems&rsquo; and will allow us to track condition in relation to the ongoing decline in rainfall combined with forest management. In a region with high climatic variability long-term studies are essential to understand ecosystem responses.</p>
<p><em>Aims:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To address KPI1 of the 2014-2023 FMP by monitoring the condition of currently healthy streams in relation to reduced rainfall and forest management practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To address KPI3 of the 2014-2023 FMP by determining responses of faunas of high value Warren region wetlands to changes in hydrology, water chemistry and fire over the last 10 to 20 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide baseline data for some internationally significant wetlands, e.g. Lake Muir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the above information to report on the current conservation significance of key DPaW managed wetlands and their response and vulnerability to threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>","<ol>
<li>
<p>FMP commitments met with regard to measuring and assessing change in condition of 1) currently healthy (reference condition) stream ecosystems (KPI1) and 2) Ramsar and nationally listed wetlands (KPI3).</p>

<p>Warren Region conservation managers will have the information needed to address a priority identified in the 2009-14 Warren Region Nature Conservation Plan: Target 5, candidate action 1, including the milestones:</p>

<p>Delivering fire scar mapping and information allows practitioners to make better decisions which leads to more efficient fuel reduction activities.</p>
<p>Some activities that contribute to these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding fire behaviour in spinifex grasslands informs prescribed burning and wildfire suppression activities.&nbsp; Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are aiding in improving fire behaviour prediction by providing comprehensive and accurate measurements of vegetation cover, volume and height, the fuel characteristics of vegetation that influence fire behaviour. Developments in UAS application together with satellite imagery will enable fire managers to more efficiently and accurately map fuel characteristics at a range of scales, greatly enhancing their ability to forecast fire danger and to predict fire behaviour without having to carry out costly ground-based field measurements.</li>
<li>The Remote Sensing &amp; Spatial Analysis (RSSA) Section has been providing annual fire scar data to the Pilbara Region since 2013.&nbsp; Through the availability and use of this data the application and requirement for fire scar information has grown.&nbsp;Consistent production and attribution of monthly fire scar mapping will result in the compilation of an annual fire scar mapping product with improved date, area and cause attribution.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Develop&nbsp;the implementation of new technology and tools for fire management e.g. use of Himawari-8 for near-real-time monitoring of fires, Sentinel satellites for more up to date fire scar mapping and assistance with the testing and implementation of the updated spatial support system.</li>
<li>Development of NBR index with Landgate which will create a whole of state derived product to assist in burn planning for the coming season, especially in the larger regions</li>
<li>Development of methods for fire scar mapping and QA. This has included the change over from using a more manual method to now mapping with ecognition which has in turn improved the accuracy and greatly improved the time it takes to map a fire scars in the big regions.</li>
<li>Statistics for specific Kimberley Region Fire Management Areas (FMAs) are provided to KSCS to monitor fire history and patterns over the FMAs and at LCI monitoring sites. This includes annual and seasonal statistics (e.g. burnt area, fire frequency, veg age class, distance to unburnt) are provided each year using NAFI fire scar mapping (determined with MODIS) and ArcGIS models.

<p>It is anticipated that the project will provide an assessment of the effectiveness of detector dogs in a Wheatbelt woodland environment to detect and locate feral cats. It is intended that any feral cats located will be humanely euthanised reducing the number of feral cats present. Numbats will be monitored in Tutanning and Boyagin using camera arrays to confirm their presence in these reserves. Involvement of community members will support the department's relationship with Numbat Taskforce and Project Numbat, engaging the public in supporting conservation.</p>",<p>The project is being funded by the Australian Government's Threatened Species Recovery Fund (via the Department of the Environment and Energy) and the Foundation for Australia's Most Endangered Species (FAME). Collaborators include DBCA's Wheatbelt Region and community groups Numbat Taskforce and Project Numbat.</p>,"<p>The endangered numbat is one of the 20 mammal species identified as priorities for action in the National Threatened Species Strategy. This project will contribute to the strategy's target of: Improving the trajectory of 20 mammals by 2020.&nbsp;The project also contributes to achieving the objectives of the Numbat Recovery Plan, including ensuring the security of existing self-sustaining subpopulations, and increasing community awareness and participation in the conservation of the numbat, by implementing the recovery actions: identify and implement appropriate methods of feral cat control at existing numbat subpopulation sites, support the Project Numbat community action group and seek grants/sponsorships to support numbat recovery.</p>","[[""Role"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Scientist"",""0.2"",""0.2"",""""],[""Technical"",""0.1"",""0.1"",""""],[""Volunteer"","""","""",""""],[""Collaborator"",""0.15"",""0.15"",""""]]","[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"",""in kind"",""in kind"",""-""],[""External Funding"",""$150,000"",""$160,000"",""-""]]",,,"<p>The numbat is an iconic WA threatened species whose decline and recovery is linked to feral cat and fox predation. Dryandra Woodland, Tutanning and Boyagin Nature Reserves&nbsp; and the Upper Warren are the last remaining sites with wild populations of numbats. These are important areas for fauna conservation in the State; not only do they support numbats but also a range of other threatened species, such as woylies and chuditch, and a variety of more common fauna species.</p>
<p>In the Dryandra Woodland, the resident numbat population is genetically valuable and is the main source of animals for the captive breeding program. Localised extinction would result in an irreparable loss of genetic diversity of the species, reduce the number of populations and area of occupancy, and opportunities for the public to see these animals in the wild. There is strong evidence that feral cats are now the primary predator of numbats in the Woodland with feral cats emerging as the key predator as fox numbers have been reduced by management.</p>
<p>This project will contribute to a broader project which acknowledges that baiting alone may not always be effective in mitigating feral cat numbers and subsequent predation of threatened species, and therefore combines multiple efforts to control introduced predators to recover numbats in the Woodland. Specifically, it will test the effectiveness of cat detector dogs to improve feral cat control efforts.</p>

580,"<p>Within the Department, the use of remote cameras is becoming more popular as a new and improved tool for fauna survey and monitoring with the assumption that they provide high quality, cost effective data.  However, their use to date has generally been restricted to simple species inventories or behavioural studies and beyond this there has been little assessment of deployment methodology or appropriate analytical techniques. This has sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions derived from captured images.  Camera traps do have the potential to offer a comparatively reliable and relatively unbiased method for monitoring medium to large native and introduced mammal species throughout the state, including a number of significant cryptic species that are currently not incorporated under the Western Shield fauna monitoring program.  However, research is required to validate and test different survey designs (temporal and spatial components) and methods of deploying camera traps and interpreting the results in a meaningful way. In particular, work is needed to determine how best to use remote cameras to provide rigorous data on species detectability, and species richness and occupancy / density. </p>","<p>Improved and standardized protocols for the deployment and use of remote cameras, and image analysis and storage, leading to more effective and efficient biological surveys and monitoring of native and introduced fauna.   </p>",<p>Great Southern District</p>,"<p>This research is aligned with DEC’s corporate plan to undertake systematic surveys of the State’s biodiversity and enhance the Western Shield monitoring program.  The trial will aid in addressing current issues with the Western Shield wildlife monitoring program by giving managers an additional tool to augment current and establish new standard monitoring programs.   </p>

1259,"<p>Penguin Island (PI) and the surrounding shallow waters of Shoalwater Islands Marine Park (SIMP) are a popular destination for Perth locals, national and international tourists. In managing the marine bio-physical assets of SIMP the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) also has a responsibility for providing, managing and maintaining appropriate access opportunities and protection for visitors who are involved in visitation and appreciation of the natural environment.</p>
<p>PI is also an important habitat for coastal birds, including the EPBC listed little penguin, Eudyptula minor whose largest WA colony is found nesting on the island. In 1996, this colony of genetically distinct penguins was given the highest conservation status of all colonies in Australia, and these penguins remain a key performance indicator for management in the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park.</p>
<p>As part of the visitor management process, DPaW measures change in visitor participation. In the case of PI, visitation (visitor participation) is predominantly measured through counts of people arriving on commercial tourist operator vessels. Although the majority of visitors reach PI on these vessels, other visitors intermittently arrive by crossing a sand bar that joins the Island to the mainland. To monitor these arrivals, the use of remote cameras offers DPaW the opportunity of making more informed choices of how to manage visitor risk. This is needed, as at low tide the sandbar may be partially exposed from the water for much of its length which can make the journey seem secure, when in fact rising tides and wind driven currents can make the trip hazardous. Although warning signs are present both on the mainland and Penguin Island advising visitors of the risks inherent in the sandbar crossing, these are regularly ignored and staff often spend many hours assisting and rescuing visitors who have run into difficulties.</p>
<p>The same remote camera set-up can also be used to inform marine park managers on the condition of the little penguin colony. The number of little penguins counted from nightly imagery (infrared) provides an early indication of behavioural changes that may occur as a result of increased pressures on little penguins during the breeding season. This is particularly important as the period of highest visitor participation on PI coincides with breeding and moulting of little penguins, both periods when little penguins are at their most vulnerable.</p>
<p>In order to effectively and efficiently limit visitor risk and manage little penguin colony, this project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visitor Risk Management</li>
<li>Establish a remote camera system which records visitor movements across the sand bar;</li>
<li>Assess the abundance (number), characteristics (age, gender) and timing of visitor movements across the sand bar;</li>
<li>Assess the reliability of current estimates of visitor sand bar use by DPaW and Surf Lifesaving; and</li>
<li>Determine factors (people and environmental conditions) that predict periods of high use of the sand bar crossing.</li>
<li>Penguin Condition Monitoring</li>
<li>Refine the process for recording beach arrivals to PI of little penguins; and</li>
<li>Assess the numbers of returning penguins to PI at strategically placed locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific outputs of this program will be:</p>
<p>A briefing paper to the Shoalwater Island Marine Park Coordinator reporting key findings from the project including recommendations on changes that may be considered to enhance the current risk management program;</p>
<p>Project recommendations for the long term monitoring of little penguins as part of the WA Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP); and</p>
<p>Recommendations for future research.</p>","<p>This research will deliver methods that effectively and efficiently inform managers on visitor participation. With a better understanding of participation at Penguin Island, and more importantly of people crossing the sand bar, visitor risk management strategies will be better targeted to ensure greater visitor safety. This information will feed directly into the management programs and governance structures and will support the existing public awareness program. The overall implications from this project are that DPaW will be able to provide improved visitor safety and greater conservation and management of Little Penguins.</p>","<p>This project will be a collaborative effort between Shoalwater Island Marine Park staff (and related PI Parks and Visitor Services Staff) and Marine Science Program staff. MSP staff will provide project leadership for the collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of the findings, while DPaW Regional staff will contribute to guiding the project intent and providing advice and input into project outputs. An external expert may be consulted to advise on data analysis.

1289,"<p>Control of feral cats is recognised as one of the most important fauna conservation issues in Australia today and as a result, a national 'Threat Abatement Plan (TAP) for Predation by Feral Cats' has been developed. The TAP seeks to protect affected native species and ecological communities, and to prevent further species and ecological communities from becoming threatened. In particular, the first objective of the TAP is to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent feral cats from occupying new areas in Australia and eradicate feral cats from high-conservation-value 'islands'</li>
</ul>
<p>The eradication of feral cats proposed for Dirk Hartog Island follows a prescribed course of action (phases) used elsewhere in successful eradication campaigns. Their first phase involves a succession of removal events that reduce the pest population to such low levels that further efforts often do not find and remove any more animals. Their second phase attempts to validate or assess whether in fact this lack of detection means eradication may have been achieved. Assuming no more pests are found, their third phase is one of surveillance to confirm the assessment and it may continue until a decision is made to stop and declare the eradication a success. Detecting survivors and interpreting the lack of such detections to set stop rules are critical elements of this strategy. Their process collects spatially explicit data on the numbers of animals removed and on the effort to do this as it proceeds.</p>
<p>The size of Dirk Hartog Island, in particular its length, pose logistical constraints on conducting an eradication campaign across the entire island simultaneously. It is not practical or feasible to monitor for cat activity over such a large area and as such, the eradication campaign will be conducted in stages. Each of these stages is outlined briefly below.</p>
<p>Stage 1 (January-April 2014) will be dedicated to establishment of infrastructure in the southern section (Herald Bay) including accommodation and equipment storage, installation of the southern monitoring track network and construction of the barrier fence. Infrastructure construction will be transportable to provide flexibility in its use and options for utilization elsewhere at the completion of the project. Time restrictions due to delays in delivery of the barge have meant that only infrastructure south of the barrier fence can be established within this time period. Infrastructure north of the fence (Sandy Bay accommodation site) and installation of the northern monitoring track network will need to be established when time permits later in 2014.</p>
<p>Stage 2 (May/June 2014-May/June 2015) [Phase 1] a baiting campaign will be conducted May/June 2014 south of the cat barrier fence, an area of approximately 220km<sup>2</sup>. An intensive monitoring program will be adopted following the baiting campaign to locate any cat activity. Where warranted, ground-baiting and trapping will be implemented to remove any cats that remain. [Phase 2] At the completion of the monitoring/trapping program, a team of detector dogs and their handlers will be contracted to independently verify eradication.</p>
<p>Stage 3(May/June 2015-May/June 2016) [Phase 1] a baiting campaign will be conducted May/June 2015 north of the cat barrier fence, an area of approximately 420km<sup>2</sup>. As above, an intensive monitoring program will be adopted following the baiting campaign to locate any cat activity. Where warranted, ground-baiting and trapping will be implemented to remove any cats that remain. [Phase 2] At the completion of the monitoring/trapping program, a team of detector dogs and their handlers will be contracted to independently verify eradication.</p>
<p>Stage 4 June 2016-June 2018) [Phase 3] a two year surveillance monitoring program will be instigated for a further two years prior to any native species reintroductions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is extensive evidence that domestic cats (Felis catus) introduced to offshore and oceanic islands around the world have had deleterious impacts on endemic land vertebrates and breeding bird populations (eg. van Aarde 1980; Moors and Atkinson 1984; King 1985; Veitch 1985; Bloomer and Bester 1992; Bester et al. 2002; Keitt et al. 2002; Pontier et al. 2002; Blackburn et al. 2004; Martinez-Gomez and Jacobsen 2004; Nogales et al. 2004; Ratcliffe et al. 2009; Bonnaud et al. 2010). Feral cats have been known to drive numerous extinctions of endemic species on islands and have contributed to at least 14% of all 238 vertebrate extinctions recorded globally by the IUCN (Nogales et al., 2013). In addition, predation by feral cats currently threatens 8% of the 464 species listed as critically endangered (Medina et al. 2011; Nogales et al. 2013). Island faunas that have evolved for long periods in the absence of predators are particularly susceptible to cat predation (Dickman, 1992). Dirk Hartog Island--once a high biodiversity island--is no exception.</p>
<p>On Dirk Hartog Island (620km2), which is the largest island off the Western Australian coast (Abbott and Burbidge 1995), 10 of the 13 species of native terrestrial mammals once present are now locally extinct (Baynes 1990; McKenzie et al. 2000) probably due to predation by cats (Burbidge 2001; Burbidge and Manly 2002). The extirpated species of mainly medium-sized mammals include: boodie (Bettongia lesueur),woylie (Bettongia penicillata), western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville), chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis), greater stick-nest rat (Leporillus conditor), desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor), Shark Bay mouse (Pseudomys fieldi), and heath mouse (Pseudomys shortridgei). Only smaller species still inhabit the island: ash-grey mouse (Pseudomys albocinereus), sandy inland mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis), and the little long-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis dolichura). It is possible that the banded hare-wallaby (Lagostrophus fasciatus) and rufous hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus) were also on the island as they are both on nearby Bernier and Dorre Islands, and were once on the adjacent mainland. The island also contains threatened bird species including: Dirk Hartog Island white-winged fairy wren (Malurus leucopterus leucopterus), Dirk Hartog Island southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus hartogi), and the Dirk Hartog Island rufous fieldwren (Calamanthus campestris hartogi). A population of the western spiny-tailed skink (Egernia stokesii badia) found on the island is also listed as threatened.</p>
<p>Since the 1860s, Dirk Hartog Island has been managed as a pastoral lease grazed by sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus). More recently, tourism has been the main commercial activity on the island. Cats were probably introduced by early pastoralists and became feral during the late 19th century (Burbidge 2001). The island was established as a National Park in November 2009, which now provides the opportunity to reconstruct the native mammal fauna (Algar et al. 2011). Dirk Hartog Island could potentially support one of the most diverse mammal assemblages in Australia and contribute significantly to the long-term conservation of several threatened species. Successful eradication of feral cats would be a necessary precursor to any mammal reintroductions.</p>","<p>The biodiversity outcome from this project will be a measurable decline in the cat population, eventually to zero when eradication is confirmed.</p>
<p>There will be global interest in the outcome of this project and the techniques used. Knowledge and technology transfer to other agencies contemplating cat eradications on islands will be through publication of manuscripts in scientific journals and presentations at various conferences.</p>","<p>This project has been discussed at length with District/Regional staff and various Dirk Hartog committees since the project was proposed almost a decade ago. The umbrella program 'Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological Restoration Project' is a collaboration with other Science and Conservation Division Programs. Collaboration with departmental staff, other government agencies, industry, traditional land owners and the broader community has commenced and will continue as the project progresses.</p>

Knowledge gained will be of direct relevance to creating and implementing catchment and wetland recovery plans and other adaptive management programs. Work planned, or underway, in the Drummond, Toolibin and Bryde Natural Diversity Recovery Catchments is outlined below. Similar additional work will be run under this project as needs and opportunities allow.</p>
<p><strong>Drummond</strong></p>
<p>Recent work has identified two knowledge gaps relating to the management of <em>Melaleuca lateritia</em>, a dominant floristic feature of a TEC in the Drummond NDRC. In this project we aim to address these by 1) identifying the salinity and waterlogging thresholds for <em>M. lateritia</em> and 2) testing the possibility that predation on <em>M. lateritia</em> seeds and seedlings is a significant impediment to successful recruitment.</p>
<p><strong>Toolibin</strong></p>
<p>As part of ongoing operational activities, the Toolibin Lake NDRC officers and other regional staff are planning to revegetate areas of Toolibin Lake. In this project we will 'value-add' to the region's revegetation efforts by providing scientific direction, a rigorous experimental design and monitoring of plant physiology to answer important questions relating to the optimization of revegetation to increase survival, condition and growth in a disturbed heterogeneous environment. Although short-term outcomes will be achieved, revegetation is a long-term activity (i.e. 20 to 40 years) so there is considerable scope for ongoing research should resources become available.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Bryde</strong></p>
<p>Ongoing work within the Lakelands Nature Reserve is exploring the traits that control performance during stress of two main functional groups (<em>Melaleuca</em> shrubs and Mallee eucalypts). The work proposed here will build on the encouraging results already obtained by determining the operational gas exchange capacity of the species after irrigation. The goal of this work is to provide biologically meaningful criteria for future hydrological interventions.</p>","<p><strong>Drummond</strong></p>
<p>1) Knowledge of salinity and waterlogging thresholds for <em>M. lateritia</em> which will enhance ability to predict responses to increased salinity and to plan management responses.</p>

1306,"<p>The peat wetlands of the Muir-Byenup System Ramsar site are undergoing accelerated hydrological and hydrochemical changes due to changes in climate and land use (particularly agroforestry). For example, a recent major acidification event may have changed the ecological character of one of the larger Ramsar wetlands (Tordit-Gurrup) and require a formal assessment. Another wetland (Noobijup Swamp) has acidified following groundwater drawdown associated with blue-gum plantations.

1307,"<p>The wetlands conservation program has a strong focus on aquatic invertebrate biodiversity, including spatial patterning and trends over time in relation to threats. Over half of the species we deal with are not formally described, but they are consistently named across projects through maintenance of a voucher specimen collection.</p>
<p>As opportunities and skills allow program staff undertake systematics studies (primarily species descriptions), sometimes with specialist co-authors. This allows formal naming and description of Western Australian endemics that would not otherwise occur and allows species to be consistently identified by external research groups. Examples include descriptions of 'giant ostracods by Halse and McRae (Hydrobiologia 524) and first records of phallodriline oligochaetes from Australian non-marine waters by Pinder et al. (Zootaxa 1304). Kirsty Quinlan is currently describing a species of Boeckella copepod from Lorna Glen.</p>
<p>For many groups of invertebrates there are inadequate tools for their identification and program staff frequently devise in-house keys to help with identification consistency. On occasion we have been able to produce tools of sufficient quality to release to the public.

301,"<p>The South-West Botanical Province of Western Australia is species rich and is recognised as one of 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world. A considerable proportion of south-western Australia's plant diversity is found in the semi-arid Transitional Rainfall Zone where the flora is characterised by high endemism, large numbers of relictual (ancient) and recently evolved plant taxa with naturally small populations and highly localised often disjunct distributions. This pattern of diversity has been attributed to several factors; firstly, the presence of an ancient highly weathered landscape with a mosaic of soils and landforms providing the scope for ecological differentiation, secondly, a long period of landscape stablility free of glaciation and major tectonic activity and therefore associated mass extinctions; and thirdly, in the last two million years alternating wet and dry periods with generally increasing aridity and frequency of fire resulting in periodic expansion, contraction, colonisation and isolation of plant populations creating conditions suitable for explosive speciation. The Transitional Rainfall Zone is now largely occupied by the Western Australian agricultural wheatbelt with approximately 80% of the native vegetation cleared.  Consequently, a large part of Western Australia's unique floral biodiversity now exists in remnants of native vegetation varying size, shape and connectivity in highly altered landscapes where disturbance and hydrological regimes have changed and exotic weeds and diseases have been introduced.  It is therefore perhaps not surprising in such a diverse flora where rarity was common that 95 plant taxa are currently listed as Critically Endangered, 128 Endangered, 104 Vulnerable, 23 presumed extinct and a further 1708 taxa considered as a priority for further survey to determine their conservation status. </p>
<p>The evolutionary history of the south-western Australian flora and large number of threatened taxa warrant flora conservation being given a high priority in the region.  However, although habitat destruction may have been the reason for many plant taxa becoming threatened in the first place, there are continuing threats associated with the contemporary landscape that may be contributing to the continued decline of remaining populations.  These include continued habitat destruction; the potential effects that being a small isolated population might have on attracting pollinators, producing sufficient quantities of seed and maintaining genetic diversity; changed fire regimes including reduced frequency of fire resulting in declines in taxa dependent on fire related cues for germination or alternatively increased frequency of fire resulting in declines of taxa which have long maturation times; and finally, declining rates of seedling establishment and increased rates of adult mortality through interactions with introduced exotic weeds, diseases, herbivores and rising saline water tables. Whilst all of these factors may be operating in the contemporary landscape they may have different relative importance for different plant taxa depending on each taxa's life history and the nature of polllinator interactions.  Currently for many threatened plant taxa the relative importance of the contemporary ecological factors which constrain population growth are poorly understood and little is known about the management actions required to maintain stable populations of plants. Consequently, there is often little scientific guidance for conservation managers to determine which threats/actions have the highest priority.  Scientific investigations into the limitations on population growth in critically endangered and endangered plants and the development of general models of plant population responses to changing population size and landscape context will provide guidance for determining priority actions for recovery, translocation and ongoing conservation management of threatened plant taxa.  These investigations form the basis for this Science Project Plan.  The taxa chosen for study will be driven by the recovery plan process and degree of threat.  However, there are 350 taxa currently gazetted as threatened and there are not enough resources to undertake comprehensive population ecology studies on all of them.  One response to this problem is to categorise the threatened list into groups of taxa based on functional attributes that affect population persistence and are affected by fragmentation and subsequently work on taxa within each of these groups.  Particular attributes that may be useful are floral architecture (and how this relates to pollination by generalist and specialist pollinators may be differentially affected by fragmentation) and fire life histories (and how this relates to response to disturbance in general). Consequently external funds will be sought to categorise the threatened flora list into functional groups based on floral architecture and choose taxa for detailed investigation on the basis of their ability quantitative data which can be extrapolated to other taxa. </p>","<p>The research will provide sound scientific basis for managing threatened flora and will </p>

289,"<p>There has been a large number of studies of catchment hydrology in the forests of south-west Western Australia and these studies have provided an adequate understanding of hydrologic processes and the impact of forest management on catchment hydrology.  A review of these studies was undertaken as a part of developing the current Forest Management Plan and changes in practice were adopted as a result.  The current practices represent a conservative, precautionary approach to the management of forests to ensure the protection of potable water supplies.  Nevertheless, there have been no catchment studies on the hydrologic impacts of the current silvicultural practices in jarrah forest.</p>
<p>Three research catchments in the Yarragil Brook catchment area in the IRZ in the northern jarrah forest are available in which monitoring of groundwater level, stream flow, stream salinity, and salt load is ongoing and for which records good exist for at least the previous ten years.  More limited records exist going back to the mid 1970's.  Unfortunately, the Water and Rivers Commission who were monitoring these catchment, have recently ceased this monitoring.  CALM now undertakes monitoring of hydrologic variables in these catchments.</p>
<p>Two of the catchments, 4X and 6C, occur in areas subject to logging in the near future.  This project aims to impose logging treatments in 4X and 6C, to use the third catchment, Wuraming, as a control, and to continue the hydrological monitoring.</p>
<p>The logging prescription proposed for 4X is the standard prescription for the IRZ.  This is a more conservative prescription than that applied to the high rainfall zone, and includes the retention of at least 30% of the catchment at a basal area of at least 15m2ha-1 for a period of at least 15 years after harvesting the remainder of the catchment.</p>
<p>The experimental prescription proposed for 6C is less conservative than the standard, i.e. omit the requirement for the retention of 30% of the catchment with a basal area of 15m2ha-1 but still retain the standard stream reserves.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the hydrologic response to the standard prescription (in 4X) will be minimal.  The purpose of testing the less conservative treatment proposed for 6C is to promote a greater hydrologic response and therefore to provide more information on which to model forest hydrology and develop improved future practices.</p>","<p>The study will provide records of stream flow, salinity, and salt load, and vegetation density, before- and after-treatment which will enable an estimation of changes to the hydrology in relation to changes in vegetation density.</p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

305,"<p>Naturally fragmented and disjunct population systems are a feature of the rich and diverse flora in south-west Australia. Apart from the high level of species diversity the south-west contains a relatively high proportion of rare and geographically restricted plants. Nearly 46% of Australia's rare and threatened flora are found in Western Australia (Atkins, 1998) with over 95% found in the south-west (Coates and Atkins 2000.  A range of processes have no doubt contributed to rarity in this flora with many rare species considered to be relictual and to have persisted as fragmented remnants following localised extinction and fragmentation in association with the increased aridity and climatic instability during the Pleistocene. Superimposed upon this system of historically fragmented and isolated populations are the broad-scale effects of recent widespread land clearing over the last 150 years and the associated extensive habitat fragmentation</p>
<p>The genetic consequences of recent habitat fragmentation generally relate to the effects of reduced population size and increased geographical isolation among populations (Young et al., 1997; Barrett and Kohn, 1991).  In species with a continuous metapopulation structure, fragmentation is predicted to lead to a loss of genetic variation and increased divergence among populations.  These effects can be due to increased drift, increased inbreeding, reduced gene flow between populations and local population extinction (Young et al., 1997).  Limited studies to date support the prediction that habitat fragmentation and associated reduction in remnant size results in loss of genetic variation (see Prober and Brown, 1994).  The population genetic consequences of recent habitat fragmentation on already fragmented population systems are likely to be similar, although in those species with historically small isolated populations, loss of genetic variation and increased inbreeding may be more severe.  </p>
<p>Population fragmentation, whether historical or due to recent habitat disturbance, might also be expected to affect the mating system, particularly in small isolated populations (Sampson et al., 1996; Young et al., 1997).  There is only limited evidence to date to indicate a relationship between increased inbreeding and fragmentation (Young et al., 1997).  However, we have shown that, in a number of species where fragmentation is also associated with habitat disturbance, lower levels of outcrossing are a feature of highly disturbed populations.  In these cases habitat disturbance was linked to loss of pollinators, change in pollinator behaviour and the introduction of new pollinators.</p>
<p>Most of the 120 currently ranked critically endangered plants and a significant proportion of the State's threatened flora (DRF) now exist as small fragmented populations.  Apart from abiotic factors such as land clearing, roadworks and associated activities the ability of these to populations to persist for any reasonable period of time will depend upon a combination of ecological and genetic factors.  The ecological constraints to population persistence will be addressed in the Science Project Plan on The population ecology of critically endangered flora.  In this project plan the significance of the level of genetic variation, its maintenance and the effects of changes outcrossing (inbreeding) will be assessed in relation to population size and information gathered from the ecological studies. These investigations will provide baseline information for ongoing in situ management particularly in relation to the importance and maintenance of populations size.  Outcomes will relate directly to the recovery, translocation, ex situ germ plasm collection and ongoing management of threatened flora and other high priority flora.  </p>
<p>Taxa to be targeted for this work will primarily be those listed as critically endangered and part of ongoing ecological studies but other taxa may be targeted where they provide general model system information for the management of small fragmented populations. </p>","<p>The research will provide sound scientific basis for managing threatened flora and will </p>

<p>The recent review of distribution and conservation status (de Tores, in prep) found the western ringtail possum met the IUCN (World Conservation Union) criteria (IUCN, 2001) for listing as a threatened species in the sub-category “Vulnerable”. </p>
<p>History of previous western ringtail possum translocations</p>
<p>Despite being listed as a “threatened” species, the western ringtail possum is locally common in the Busselton area of south-west Western Australia.  Orphaned, injured and “nuisance” western ringtail possums are regularly brought into care and nurtured and/or rehabilitated by wildlife carers.  Historically, when the wildlife carers decided these possums were suitable for release, the animals were “provided” to the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) and released as part of a translocation and monitoring program.  Many were not “provided” to CALM and were released, and continue to be released, in an <em>ad-hoc</em> un-monitored manner.  The latter has not been sanctioned by CALM.  The pre-release health and disease status and subsequent fate of these released animals are unknown.</p>
<p>In the Busselton area in particular, local and State Government approved developments have resulted in fragmentation and removal/destruction of western ringtail possum habitat.  Resident populations of western ringtail possums are regularly displaced as a result of this habitat fragmentation and habitat loss.  If unchecked, this habitat fragmentation will present a major threat to the western ringtail possum.</p>
<p>Existing known threats to the species include (de Tores, in prep; Wayne_ et al._, 2000):</p>
<p>·                population fragmentation through urbanisation and development in the Busselton, Bunbury and Albany areas;</p>
<p>·                predation from introduced predators;</p>
<p>·                increased predation in the presence of timber harvesting operations; and</p>
<p>·                climate change.</p>
<p>Translocation has been adopted as a management strategy to mitigate the effects from habitat clearing.  However, results from translocation have been equivocal.  Translocations of the western ringtail possum have been carried out by CALM since 1991.  A total of 381 western ringtail possums was translocated to four release sites in the period 1991 to 2001.</p>
<p>Of these, 106 rehabilitated possums, ex wildlife carers, were released at Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park in the period from 1991 to 1997; 142 were sourced directly from the wild (development sites, where habitat was destroyed), and released at Yalgorup National Park (two sites) in the period 1995 to 2001; and 133 were rehabilitated possums, ex wildlife carers, released at Lane Poole Reserve/Keats forest Block in the period 1996 to 1999 (various unpublished data).  The total number of translocated possums is thought to represent only a relatively small proportion of the number of western ringtail possums relocated, as many more rehabilitated ringtails have been released by wildlife carers as part of unsanctioned and un-monitored translocations.</p>
<p>All CALM sanctioned translocations were to release sites baited for fox control (dried meat baits impregnated with the toxin sodium monofluroacetate, or 1080).  All sites were monitored as funds permitted.</p>
<p>Each release site has shown some level of translocation success.  However, the full criteria for translocation success have not been met at any site.   Monitoring results from the primary release site, Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park, confirmed this population declined to a level where extensive survey effort was required to confirm western ringtail possum presence (de Tores_ et al._, 2004).</p>
<p>Changes to the 1080 baiting regime, specifically lapses in the baiting effort, a reduction in the number of baits delivered and a change to burying the baits, was proposed as the most parsimonious explanation for the decline at Leschenault (de Tores_ et al.<em>, 2004; de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  However, fauna declines are unlikely to be the result of a single dimensional causal factor, such as predation (de Tores, in prep) and this no doubt also applies to translocation failure.  Alternative hypotheses proposed as possible causes for the translocation failure at Leschenault include competition with the common brushtail possum, _Trichosurus vulpecula</em>, predation by cats and/or chuditch and/or pythons, drought, unsuitable habitat, wildlife health related issues, presence of disease (toxoplasmosis has been confirmed in the ringtail population at Yalgorup) and prey switching (rabbit control has been conducted concurrently with fox control at Leschenault and has resulted in an observed, but unquantified, decline in rabbit abundance.  With this decline there is the possibility of prey switching by the suite of introduced and native predators and the potential for increased levels of predation on the western ringtail possum) (de Tores and Rosier, in prep).</p>
<p><em>Post-hoc</em> analyses using DISTANCE sampling techniques (Buckland_ et al.<em>, 2001; Thomas</em> et al.<em>, 2002) of data from spotlight transects at Leschenault (1996 - 1998 and 2002) and Yalgorup (2002) identified increases in brushtail possum and western ringtail possum density at Leschenault in 1996-1998, and an additional, but small increase in density in brushtail possums in the period 1998-2002 (the period when the western ringtail possum declined at Leschenault) (de Tores</em> et al.<em>, 2004; de Tores and Rosier, in prep; de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  Further analyses also indicated partitioning of the nocturnal foraging habitat by the two species .  These results combined, suggested competition with the brushtail possum alone was unlikely to have been responsible for the western ringtail possum decline at Leschenault (de Tores</em> et al._, 2004).</p>
<p>Additional translocations of displaced western ringtail possums have taken place in 2004.  These translocations have been necessitated by the requirement to relocate western ringtail possums displaced by developments which have removed western ringtail possum habitat.  The releases were at Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park (where monthly baiting was re-instated) and an unbaited control site established within Yalgorup National Park.</p>
<p>A subset of 37 of the 100 western ringtail possums released at Leschenault since January 2004 has been radio-collared and monitored.  Interim results have demonstrated a higher rate of predation-caused mortality at the baited site.  At 1 June 2006, there had been 11 mortality events attributed to predation by pythons, 10 attributed to predation by cats, 3 attributed to predation by a fox/cat? and 1 attributed to predation by fox.  33 of the 55 released ringtail possums at the unbaited Yalgorup site since January 2004 have been radio-collared and there have been only 5 known predation events, 1 attributed to a raptor and 1 to a fox, 2 to a fox? and 1 to a cat.  The results suggest a pattern of increasing predation events by cats and pythons in the presence of fox control.  This is consistent with the concept of mesopredator release.</p>
<p>Disease/wildlife health</p>
<p>Disease is often overlooked as a potential agent of population decline (Caughley and Gunn, 1996) and infectious diseases can result in significant declines of wildlife at the local population level and at the species level (Caughley and Gunn, 1996; Daszak and Cunningham, 1999; Spielman, 2001).  Disease poses an additional threat to wildlife populations already at risk from threatening processes and in some situations may be the final factor responsible for driving a species to extinction.  </p>
<p>In particular, introduced diseases can have a detrimental effect on naïve wildlife populations when trans-species infections occur from infected reservoir hosts.  Wildlife species known to have suffered significant population declines associated with infectious diseases include African buffalos (<em>Syncerus caffer</em>), black-footed ferrets, <em>Mustela nigripes,</em> (canine distemper virus); the heath hen , <em>Tymphanuchus cupido cupido</em> (by blackhead), the Indian wild ass, <em>Equus hemionus khur</em> (by surra and African horse sickness), amphibian species (chytridiomycosis); lions, <em>Pantera Leo</em>, (canine distemper virus); and African wild dogs, <em>Lycaon pictus</em>, (rabies, canine distemper virus) (Caughley and Gunn, 1996; Daszak and Cunningham, 1999; Daszak_ et al._, 2000). </p>
<p>There are potentially significant disease risks associated with wildlife translocation programs. Woodford and Rossiter (1994) outlined the disease risks which should be considered by conservation managers when undertaking a translocation project.  The risks for each translocation project will vary depending on the type of animal and epidemiological situations at the founding source location and release destination (Woodford and Rossiter, 1994).  Capture, transport and quarantine are stressful events for wild animals and stress in such animals can result in immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to infection and recrudescence of latent disease (Woodford and Rossiter, 1994). </p>
<p>There are two aspects of disease transmission which must be considered for translocation projects.  Conservation managers must ensure the wildlife species being translocated, especially those originating from captivity, do not introduce novel pathogens to naïve populations of wildlife at the release site (Warren_ et al._, 2003; Woodford and Rossiter, 1994).  Conversely, they also need to be aware that resident native and introduced animals inhabiting the release site may carry pathogens to which the released animals have had no previous exposure.  Infection with such pathogens could adversely affect the survival of the released animals (Woodford and Rossiter, 1994).</p>
<p>Issues</p>
<p>The ongoing requirement to clear land for housing and industry in the greater Busselton area will continue to result in habitat loss and displacement of resident populations of the western ringtail possum.  There will be a continued need for land use planners and wildlife managers to address the conservation management issues associated with this habitat loss.  Although translocation has been identified as a possible management option for displaced and rehabilitated western ringtail possums, translocations are yet to be shown to result in sustainable populations at the release sites.</p>
<p>Monitoring of translocations to date has been opportunistic (i.e. as funds permitted) and has lacked a strategic approach whereby the suite of factors potentially limiting translocation success can be objectively assessed.  Although there are sufficient published data to suggest the western ringtail possum is highly susceptible to predation by foxes (see for example Augee_ et al._, 1996), the importance of other factors in terms of translocation success has not been determined.  Specifically:</p>
<p>(1)          There are no base-line data on the disease status of western ringtail possum populations in the wild.  During previous translocation procedures the pre-release health status was not assessed.  There was no identification or investigation of any disease conditions resulting from holding rehabilitated possums “in care” for short or extended periods.  There has been no comparison of survivorship and long-term health status of rehabilitated possums and possums translocated directly from the wild.</p>
<p>(2)          Toxoplasmosis was identified on post-mortem examination of a ringtail possum recruited to the translocated population at Yalgorup National Park (de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  The animal showed neurological signs following routine capture for radio collar replacement.  The possum was not released due to its clinical condition and was taken into captivity for care.  It failed to respond or show any evidence of recovery.  It was subsequently euthanased and the presence of Toxoplasmosis confirmed (de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  The prevalence of toxoplasmosis in ringtail possums in Yalgorup National Park and the other release sites remains unknown.  The prevalence of toxoplasmosis in feral cat populations (host) at each of the release sites is unknown.</p>
<p>(3)          The influence of the suite of site specific habitat factors has not been assessed.</p>
<p>(4)          The effect of competition, should it exist, between the western ringtail possum and the common brushtail has not been rigorously assessed.</p>
<p>(5)          Predation of western ringtail possums by pythons, <em>Morelia spilota imbricata</em>, has now been confirmed at the Leschenault Peninsula release site.  It is unclear if these predation events are a result of site specific factors, increased python abundance resulting from a reduced level of predation by foxes, increased python abundance and different use of the landscape resulting from a mesopredator release effect, learned behaviour, or seasonal predation patterns.  Similarly, it is not known if on-going predation by pythons, should it occur, will jeopardise translocation success, or if these effects can be ameliorated by the timing of translocation releases.</p>
<p>(6)          The potential for cat populations to increase in the presence of fox control (mesopredator release) has not been assessed.  Anecdotal accounts have reported such increases, however, no unequivocal data are available to support this assertion.  Even if such changes in cat abundance do occur, these changes cannot be assumed to equate with an increase in the net level of predation of the translocated species, or other <em>in-situ</em> species.</p>
<p>(7)          There are no data available from this study, or other translocation studies, to differentiate between individual animals responsible for predation events.  The frequency of predation events of western ringtail possums at the Leschenault Peninsula release site since January 2004, combined with the spatial pattern of the retrieved carcasses and the nature of the predation events (i.e. predation attributed to a cat) suggests many of the mortality events attributed to predation by cats, may be the result of predation by one cat.  If this is the case, it provides managers with a very different long-term problem from that posed by an increased rate of predation resulting from an increase in cat abundance.</p>
<p>(8)          Wildlife carer records for the ten year period 1994 to 2003 revealed an average of 123 western ringtail possums per year had been handled by one carer alone.  Only a small proportion of these animals has been passed on to CALM for release as part of the formal release programs at Leschenault, Yalgorup and Lane Poole Reserve.  This suggests there is a very large number of ringtails “passing through” the wildlife carer network and released in unsanctioned translocations.  The fate of these animals is unknown.  The conservation value of releasing animals, post rehabilitation and/or post being held in care for other reasons, can only be assessed if releases are monitored.</p>
<p>(9)          The genetic structure of wild populations of the western ringtail possum is unknown.  Specifically, there is no information on mating systems, population sizes, gene flow and the effect of population and habitat fragmentation.  Similarly, the genetic structure of the founding stock used for translocations and the genetic structure of the establishing populations at translocation release sites are not known.</p>
<p>The translocation  -  General</p>
<p>The release and monitoring program is proposed to build on the results from previous translocations to Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park and Yalgorup National Park (de Tores_ et al._, 2004; de Tores and Rosier, in prep; de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  Translocation releases and monitoring re-commenced in 2004.  These translocations were sanctioned under interim approval from the Department of Conservation and Land Management and were deemed necessary as a result of habitat destruction from developments in the Busselton area.</p>
<p>138 western ringtail possums were relocated from three development sites in the period 13 January to 17 July 2004, with an additional 17 rehabilitated ringtails, ex wildlife carers, released in August 2004.  Capture, relocation and monitoring of these displaced and rehabilitated ringtails has been undertaken on an <em>ad-hoc</em> basis as funds permitted.  The continuity and intensity of monitoring was again determined by the amount of funds available from developers.</p>
<p>Translocations and longer-term monitoring are now proposed through an integrated program structured in an active adaptive management framework, whereby monitoring (performance evaluation in a research context) is used to trigger changes to management (Possingham, 2001).  If sufficiently funded, monitoring will address the issues of mesopredator release and intraguild predation.  Mesopredator release is defined as an increase in the abundance of subordinate predators following the removal of a dominant predator which previously held the subordinate species in check (Soule_ et al.<em>, 1988). Such an occurrence may constitute one link in a larger trophic cascade.  Intraguild predation is a combination of competition and predation and is the killing of one species by another species where both species use similar, often limiting, resources (Polis</em> et al.<em>, 1989).  It is different from “classical predation” as the act of intraguild predation reduces potential exploitation competition (Polis</em> et al._, 1989).</p>
<p>The translocation program (de Tores, 2005) is innovative as it advocates development and use of novel “contact” telemetry for monitoring of predator and prey species.  The use of contact telemetry will also enable examination of the issues of mesopredator release and intraguild predation.  Contact telemetry utilises a technology whereby a data logger is incorporated into the radio-tag circuitry.  The data logger records when two tags (radio-collars) come in contact with, or are within close proximity of, each other and records the identity of the two tags (i.e. the two individual animals) in contact.  The data logger also records the time of the contact event.  For example, when a western ringtail possum (wrp1) is in contact with a radio-tagged cat (cat1), the contact event is recorded and the data is downloaded when the tag is subsequently recovered.  The data recorded by the data logger of “wrp1’s” tag include the specific ID of “cat1” and the exact timing of the contact event.  The corresponding information is recorded by the data logger in “cat1’s” tag.  Adoption of this technology will enable collection of detailed information on intraguild predation (i.e. it will enable detection of predation of cats by foxes, should it occur), on inter-specific competition (i.e. it will enable detection of cats and foxes coming into close proximity, similarly it will enable detection of ringtails and brushtails coming into close proximity) and will allow identification of the species and the individual responsible for each predation event.</p>
<p>The technology is currently advanced to a state where contact circuitry can be incorporated into collars of a weight suitable for fitting to foxes and cats.  However, pen/aviary enclosure trials are required to ensure the technology can be used on animals as small as western ringtail possums.  Ethics Committee approval has recently been given to trial these collars on western ringtail possums and common brushtail possums.  These trials will also enable assessment and adjustment of the “contact” distance, i.e. the distance between the collars required to activate “contact” mode.  The contact telemetry collars proposed for trial do not currently incorporate mortality circuitry.  Further development is required to re-instate mortality circuitry, without the collars becoming too heavy for use on the western ringtail possum.  Similarly, the option of incorporating the time of activating mortality mode into the data logger is being examined.</p>
<p>Development work is also being carried out by the collar manufacturers to determine whether contact telemetry can be downloaded remotely from satellite collars.  If this is able to be achieved, cats and foxes will be fitted with satellite collars incorporating contact circuitry.  The use of satellite telemetry will not only provide a more reliable data collection mechanism for contact events involving foxes and cats, but will provide a more cost effective mechanism for collection of fox and cat location records.  The accepted alternatives (triangulation from various ground locations and/or use of towers) are inherently difficult logistically and require an extensive commitment of field time with a lower level of precision and reliability.</p>
<p>The satellite telemetry data on fox and cat movement will also complement the mesopredator release research proposed at a landscape level (de Tores_ et al.<em>, 2005b).  This work will incorporate to use of satellite telemetry to examine mesopredator release within the northern jarrah forest of Western Australia.  Specifically, the work will examine the extent of cat movements in the presence and absence of fox control.  The research will examine, _inter alia</em>, whether the pattern of use of the landscape by cats changes when fox control is implemented over large areas.  This has ramifications for CALM’s Western Shield program, specifically for translocation programs planned for large tracts of land where fox baiting has been/will be implemented.  The western ringtail possum translocation research will complement this large scale mesopredator release research by examining the same issues at a smaller scale, i.e. at smaller habitat patches in the presence and absence of fox control.  These smaller patches are representative of many of CALM’s translocation release sites in the south-west of Western Australia.</p>
<p>The western ringtail possum translocation program (de Tores, 2005) also proposes to introduce a system whereby wildlife carers are required to notify the Department of Conservation and Land Management within 72 hours of a western ringtail possum being taken into care.  A similar system is in place for several other species (Peter Mawson, pers. comm.).  Under this proposal, wildlife carers will be required to ensure all western ringtail possums suitable for release (as determined by health screening protocols outlined in this proposal) are released in accordance with the translocation and monitoring protocols of this program and only at sites identified in this proposal.</p>
<p>It is further proposed to ensure all proponents of development proposals are aware of their requirement to seek approval from the Federal Environment Minister where the proposed development <em>“has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance”</em> (Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999 – EPBC Act).  The EPBC Act defines <em>“matters of national environmental significance”</em> to include proposals which may have an impact on listed threatened species.  Translocations from development sites will only be undertaken where the development proponent has sought and been given translocation approval from the Commonwealth of Australia, consistent with the EPBC Act, or where the Commonwealth has deemed such approval is not required.</p>","<p>The project will provide land use planners and policy/decision makers at a local, regional and national level with critical information required to determine a response to development applications which have the potential to destroy and/or fragment western ringtail possum populations and habitat.  Specifically, it will determine if translocation of displaced possums is a viable management option.</p>
<p>The project will also quantify:</p>
<ul>
<li>the extent of competition between the common brushtail possum and the western ringtail possum at sites where the two species occur sympatrically and at translocation sites and will thus determine whether competition is limiting translocation success;</li>
<li>the extent to which predation by natural and introduced species limits translocation success.  This will be assessed for each predator species separately and for the combined effect of the suite of predators;</li>
<li>The prevalence of disease in naturally occurring populations of the western ringtail possum and the common brushtail possum; and</li>
<li>The role of disease in translocation outcomes.</li>

308,"<p>The successful recovery of threatened flora, particularly critically endangered plants, will increasingly involve their translocation to secure sites.  There is currently very little information available on how to implement successful threatened plant translocations and virtually no information on how we can determine whether a translocation has or will be successful.  This project aims to develop and refine translocation methodologies, and to develop protocols for determining translocation success by monitoring and gathering critical reproductive data from 16 recently established critically endangered plant translocations.</p>
<p>The successful recovery of critically endangered flora will rely increasingly on the translocation of these flora to secure sites where the amelioration of threats has been successful or where current threats such as weeds or Phytophora are not present. Translocations are both costly and time consuming, and in many cases involve very small numbers of plants from critically endangered populations.  It is most important that we are able to develop cost effective and efficient methodologies that ensure translocation establishment and that we are also able to develop protocols for determining translocation success</p>
<p>By the end of 2001 CALM will have carried out 16 translocations of critically endangered as part of approved Interim Recovery Plans.  Various translocation methodologies have been experimentally tested and preliminary data indicates different success rates depending upon site and climatic conditions.  The development of scientifically based translocations methodologies that will offer a reasonable probability of success will require detailed monitoring and data analysis of all the experimental translocations.  Equally critical as part of the same monitoring program will be the need to develop protocols for determining and predicting translocation success.  These protocols will need to be based on estimates of the viability of the translocated population based on reproductive output (seed production, seed viability etc) and ultimately recruitment of new individuals.  Again this information can only be gathered by the detailed monitoring of each translocation .</p>
<p>The proposed project will involve the monitoring and collection of translocation technique information and demographic data from 16 experimental translocations of critically endangered flora.  Analysis if these data as part of the proposed project will provide the first comprehensive overview of translocation methodologies for threatened flora in WA and the first set of guidelines that could be used for assessing translocation success.  </p>","<ul>

Funding for the KSCS was announced as part of the State budget and included $12 M over 6 years, from 2011/12, for the Kimberley Marine Research Program (KMRP). The goal of the KMRP is to undertake a program of marine research to support the management of the proposed State marine parks at Camden Sound, North Kimberley, Roebuck Bay and Eighty Mile Beach and the coastal waters outside of these proposed marine parks. The KMRP will be developed and implemented through the Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI), with DEC as lead agency responsible for the direction, coordination and administration of the research program.</p>
<p>A research plan for the KMRP is being developed in consultation with DEC marine resource manageres and scientists to address priority research and information needs to support the management of ecological and social values in the Kimberley region. The plan will comprise a suite of research projects focussed around two themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Bio-physical and social characterization</em></strong> - to provide the foundational datasets required for marine park and marine resource management as well as better understanding and managing current human impacts; and</li>
<li><strong><em>Understanding key ecosystem processes</em></strong> – to provide the scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and response to a range of potential human impacts that are likely to arise in the future, including climate change.<br />
The Marine Science Program of DEC will lead the research program, providing guidance on project development to address key State priorities and providing science administration, coordiination and integration throughout the 6 year research program. A critical role in this regard will be the transfer of knowledge gained through the research to the relevant resource managers and operational staff as well as to the community.   </li>

313,"<p>At the request of the Executive Director, the Science Division has prepared a scoping document for a comprehensive biological survey of the Pilbara IBRA bioregion. Stygofauna has not previously been included in the broadscale biological survey program in Western Australia (eg Burbidge et al. 2000) but lack of information about stygofauna and its distribution in the Pilbara is hampering economically important resource development projects and making it difficult to assess their likely environmental impacts because of the large number of new species being discovered in impact statement surveys.  Most large projects need to de-water, which has the potential to affect the habitat of stygofauna.  Furthermore, as the population in the Pilbara increases there will be increasing use of groundwater for domestic water supply.  The urgent need for a regional survey to provide a framework for decisions about the conservation and management of stygofauna was identified in Recommendation 1 of Dr Phillip Playford's recent review of stygofauna for the Environmental Protection Authority, as well as at recent workshops involving government and industry.  Important issues for stygofaunal management are determining whether stygofaunal populations can persist in areas subject to groundwater drawdown, finding ways to facilitate their survival, and understanding the ecosystem service functions they provide.  For example, if stygofauna have an important role in the maintenance of groundwater quality, this will have implications for their protection in areas where extraction for domestic water supply is likely.  The proposed survey will attempt to provide regional level information relevant to these issues to complement studies by mining companies and others that directly address the management of drawdown.</p>",<p>To provide a planning framework for land-use in the Pilbara that enables areas with high conservation value for stygofauna to be identified and stygofaunal conservation values to be taken into account when assessing development proposals that impact on groundwater.</p>,,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

317,"<p>It is hypothesized that mammals, as well as being important in their own right, are also ‘ecosystem engineers’, aiding dispersal of plant propagules, nutrient cycling and increasing water permeability through digging and feeding activity. We have recently installed quadrats to measure any benefits to vegetation cover and plant species richness generally accruing from the presence of mammals that were extinct from these ecosystems for many decades.  </p>
<p>Murphy <em>et al. </em>(2005) have reported the benefits to sandalwood recruitment and regeneration in the presence of woylies (<em>Bettongia penicullata</em>), which dispersed and cached sandalwood seed at Dryandra woodland and Karakamia Sanctuary. Brand (1999) has also demonstrated the importance of grazing by introduced herbivores (domestic stock) on decimating sandalwood recruitment and degrading the condition of host plants in the WA rangelands. In addition to monitoring the general condition of the vegetation, I am proposing to specifically monitor a) the role of small–medium size marsupials (including Boodie - <em>Bettongia lesueur</em> and b) the effects of excluding grazing by introduced and native herbivores  in the recruitment and regeneration of WA sandalwood <em>Santalum spicatum</em>.  </p>

321,"<p><em>Acacia</em> is the largest genus of flowering plants in Australia (960 species comprising almost 1 200 taxa) and is an important component of many ecosystems, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas.  Within Western Australia there are 700 described taxa of Acacia (and perhaps as many as another 100 currently undescribed) of which 12 are listed as Critically Endangered, 7 as Endangered, 3 as Vulnerable, 2 as Extinct and 183 as Rare and Poorly Know (Buist et al. in Conservation Science Western Australia 4(3): 36-53).  Many of the Australian taxa of Acacia have the potential for economic, social and commercial utilization.  However, in order to undertake effective conservation, utilization and management of this enormous resource it is essential that the taxa be meaningfully defined and effectively named (Maslin in Conservation Science Western Australia 4(3): 1-9).  It is against this background that the current SPP is undertaken.</p>
<p>This project commenced in 2000-01 with a focus on those species considered to have agroforestry potential.  Current work involves taxonomic discrimination and investigations of the biology of <em>Acacia microbotrya</em> (for Forest Products Commission), <em>A. saligna</em> (for Natural Heritage Trust), and an assessment of the southern Australian Acacia flora for its potential as a new wood crop for semiarid regions as a means of salinity controp (for Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation under the title of AcaciaSearch).  These projects will be finalized in 2003.</p>",<p>Taxonomic discrimination of W.A.

325,"<p>The Order Oligochaeta (earthworms) was one of 6 terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate taxa whose native fauna were noted by Harvey (2002) to consist principally of short range endemic species. These species have small ranges (less than 10,000 km2). In the case of native Western Australian earthworms, ranges smaller than 100 km2 are common (Abbott and Wills 2002, Wills and Abbott 2003). Poor powers of dispersal and confinement to discontinuous habitats are characteristics of taxa containing high numbers of short-range endemics. These characteristics leave short-range endemic species vulnerable to habitat change or destruction and hence elevate them in priority for conservation research in areas where their habitats may be threatened. </p>
<p>The vegetation and hydrology of the Swan Coastal Plain have undergone extensive modification since European settlement. 21 native species of native earthworms from 136 sites have been recovered in a study of the SCP in the Perth metropolitan area. However, an estimate of the diversity prior to European settlement is as high as 38 species, almost double that recovered from systematic survey of remaining native vegetation in the Perth sector of the coastal plain. By this estimate, it is possible that the fate of at least half the earthworm diversity depends on survival in areas either cleared of native vegetation or vegetation otherwise considered to have no conservation significance. While some native earthworm species can survive in disturbed areas such as pastures most native species tend to be scarcer in disturbed habitats. </p>
<p>A primary step in the conservation of short-range endemic species is their identification through biotic surveys. We have surveyed the Perth metropolitan sector of the SCP for native earthworms, however the southern and northern parts of the SCP outside the Perth metropolitan area remain unsurveyed. The logistical requirements of comprehensive survey are not trivial. Species accumulation in regional samples is linear up to sample intensities of about 1 site per square kilometre. Sampling large regional areas at this intensity is clearly impractical. Regional sampling at the rate of 1 sample per 30-100 km2 is achievable. A modest sampling program is proposed involving a week of field work a year by two persons during June to August (depending on rainfall) over a period of 3 years. This would require an annual budget of $1600 comprising accommodation expenses of $1000 and vehicle costs of $600.</p>
<p>Documenting the terrestrial Oligochaete fauna of the entire Swan Coastal Plain will enhance the conservation of native Oligochaetes, a taxon likely to contain species vulnerable to habitat modification, by identifying species with restricted ranges. The project will do this by accumulating earthworm distribution and diversity data and evaluating the adequacy of the system of formal and informal conservation areas for terrestrial Oligocheate conservation.</p>","<p>The process of analysing collected material will enable acquisition of taxonomic skills by technical staff involved. These skills will have potential application in allowing formal description of Western Australian terrestrial Oligochaete faunas. Earthworm distribution data will provide a basis for evaluating the longer-term survival status of species collected and broaden the recognized conservation value of elements of the conservation estate. As an example, in south eastern Australia the Gippsland giant earthworm Megascolides australis, whose biology and distribution is relatively well known, is recorded as vulnerable or threatened on the following instruments: Listed on ‘Schedule 1 - Listed Species’ ‘Part 2 – Species that are vulnerable’ under the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; listed as threatened on Schedule 2 of the Victoria Fauna &amp; Flora Guarantee Act 1988.</p>

327,"<p>The development of perennial-based land use systems for the management of dryland salinity promises significant environmental and economic benefits.  Large scale planting of perennial pastures and woody crops also pose risks to existing natural biodiversity.  These risks include the establishment of new plant species as environmental weeds, hybridization with native species and gene flow from cultivated populations into natural populations (Bennett and Virtue, 2003). Invasive species have been identified as the second greatest threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction (Walker and Steffen, 1997).  Genetic contamination by native species planted outside their natural range can also have negative impacts on the viability of native vegetation.</p>","<p>A strategy for the management of environmental weed risk associated with the development of exotic and naturalized germplasm including pre-release assessment protocols.  </p>

389,"<p>Within the history of forest and natural landscape management in Western Australia many invertebrates are known to utilize forest biomass for their survival and in doing so impart some form of damage to leaves, shoot, roots, stems or branches. There are 10 recognized invertebrate species with demonstrated significant impact on tree health, vitality and timber quality within our natural environment. These are: Attractocerus krusleri (pin hole borer); Creiis periculosa (western horned lerp), Cardiaspina jerramungae (brown basket lerp); Perga spp (saw fly); Perthida glyphopa (jarrah leaf-miner, JLM); Perthida glyphopa ssp rudis (flooded gum leaf miner); Phoracantha acanthocera (bullseye borer, formerly known as Tryphocaria acanthocera, BEB); Phoracantha impavida (tuart borer); Phoracantha semipunctata and Uraba lugens (gumleaf skeletonizer, GLS) (Abbott 1992, Abbott 1995, Abbott 1993, Abbott et al 1991, Abbott et al 1993, Clay and Majer 2001). Of the species listed above, JLM, BEB and GLS are currently the most prevalent insect pests of concern in native forests such that both JLM and GLS have documented population outbreak periods (Abbott 1993, Farr 2004, Strelein 1988) and BEB incidence appears to be responsive to drought stress and likely to increase (Farr et al 2000, Wills 2011). However, Western Australian forests and woodlands also have a history of developing unexpected insect outbreaks with dramatic consequences for the ecosystem health and vitality. For example, in 1982 a previously unknown species of Cardiaspina severely defoliated large areas of Eucalyptus occidentalis in the Lower great Southern (Farr 1992, 1999).</p>
<p>The decline in mean annual rainfall in the south-west Western Australia since the 1970s is well documented (Hughes 2003, McKellar 2010), and global climate models predict that the trend to a warmer and dryer environment will intensify. Thus conditions for invertebrate pests will alter significantly in the next decade as our environment shifts toward a new climatic regime. Baseline populations of known forest and woodland invertebrate pests such as those mentioned above will shift, establishing new population equilibria. Although some currently recognised invertebrate species may drop in population, many of the new baseline pest population levels may be above thresholds that the associated environment can sustain for prolonged periods and as a consequence will be recognised as outbreak populations.  It has long been recognized that water stress induces insect outbreaks, particularly in forest environments (White 1993). Research into GLS and BEB in south-west Western Australia support this (Farr et al 2004, Farr 2002, Farr 2000, Farr et al 2000). Evidence from Forestcheck monitoring since 2001 suggest other recognised potential forest pests such as helena gum moth (Opodiphthera helena) and cup moth (Doratifera spp) are also increasing in abundance (Farr et al 2009).  Furthermore accidental introductions of non-indigenous invertebrate species (both intra- and trans- continental) are a potential for new forest pest problems for both known and formerly unknown pest species, the impacts of which could be exacerbated by a changing climate once populations are established. One introduced species already falls into this category, namely Phylacteophaga froggatti (the non-indigenous leaf blister sawfly).  Other examples include species of psyllid within the genus Cardiaspina which have been introduced to WA within the last 10 years.  These particular species (C. fiscella; C. albitextura or C. densitexta, specific identity yet to be confirmed) regularly develop into serious outbreak levels in eastern Australia (Collett 2001, Morgan 1984) and therefore already have a recognised potential to seriously impact on our environment.  Also of relevance is that since the south-west of WA has one of the least known invertebrate faunas globally, some emergent species are likely to be currently unknown, or, at the very least there will be little known about their biology.</p>
<p>This Science Project Plan therefore targets both recognised and new forest pests in terms of research directed toward understanding their biology, population dynamics, forest and environmental impacts, the influence of departmental management regimes on such populations and potentials for the implementation of adaptive management strategies to ameliorate such events if possible. Primary pest species will be targeted, rather than secondary pest species naturally dependent on a host with declining health. This project will augment strategies being developed for Forest health Surveillance as outline in the current and new Forest Management Plan (2014-23).</p>","<p>Knowledge of the behaviour, extent and impact of invertebrate forest pests will provide a sound understanding of outbreak dynamics and facilitate the development of management strategies.</p>","<p>Universities and institutions with skills and facilities relevant to this research (eg.

331,"<p>One of the overall aims of the Forest Management Plan 2004-2013 is to protect soil and water resources in forested areas to which the Plan applies. Key performance indicator (KPI) 20 is the percentage of waterbodies (e.g. stream kilometres, lake hectares) with significant variance of biodiversity from the historic range of variability. The intent of KPI20 is to provide a measure of the success of the Forest Management Plan in protecting the ecological integrity and quality of streams.</p>
<p>The rationale behind this project is that logging and fire frequently cause changes to stream conditions and, consequently, their ecology. Sedimentation and opening up of canopy are usually the greatest causes of impact (see Halse and Blyth 1992), with much of the sediment coming from roads crossing streams.</p>
<p>The project addresses KPI20 by monitoring aquatic macroinvertebrates and measuring various aspects of water physico-chemistry at 40-50 sites in spring each year. The protocol being used is based on AUSRIVAS and AUSRIVAS models will be used to assess the degree of disturbance in the streams subject to monitoring (Halse <em>et al</em>. 2001).</p>",<p>Project will monitor whether DEC is meeting FMP commitments with regard to maintaining forest stream biodiversity.

337,"<p>Rehabilitation of sites through revegetation requires knowledge of the genetic adaptation of the species to the sites in order to manage these sites on an ecologically sustainable basis. This requires an understanding of the genetic structure and local adaptation of the species. </p>
<p>CALM has provided guidelines to Forest Products Commission that collections of seed for rehabilitation of understorey species in forest sites should be made within a 20km radius of the site. It is generally agreed in the scientific community that local seed sources should be used in rehabilitation so as to protect the genetic integrity of sites and maintain any adaptive variation that has developed through evolutionary history. However, the definition of “local” is very vague and rarely directly specified. </p>
<p>There is no scientific data to underpin the determination of seed collection zones in Western Australian forests. Identification of appropriate seed source distances requires information on the level and extent of local adaptation and underlying genetic diversity within species. This information can be obtained through growth trials and analysis of genetic diversity. By determining this information for a range of species with different life histories and breeding systems, general guidelines on seed collection zones can be developed that will be implemented in forest rehabilitation programs.</p>
<p>The project will initially be focused on species in the Jarrah and Karri forest where seed is used for rehabilitation after logging by Forest Products Commission. Later the project may be expanded to include species outside the south-west forest areas.</p>

579,"<p>Restoration of natural riparian vegetation systems is being undertaken at strategic locations where blackberry decline has occurred along the Warren and Donnelly Rivers to control invasive plant and animal species and mitigate erosion pressures in the context of the region's changing climate. The Warren Catchment Council are seeking a scientific basis for undertaking this restoration taking into consideration the future impacts of climate change on the riparian vegetation. Current practices of seed sourcing for revegetation projects focus on local seed based on a premise of maximising adaptation to local conditions and may not be most appropriate under changing climatic conditions. Identification of patterns of adaptive variation will enable more informed approaches to species selection and seed sourcing to maximise biodiversity establishment and persistence.</p>
<p>This project will assess vegetation communities adjacent to restoration sites and undertake climate modeling for selected species appropriate for revegetation. Selection of seed source populations will be determined through assessment of adaptive variation and population genetic structure for three species along the Warren River and its tributaries.

354,"<p>Land clearing and subsequent fragmentation of native vegetation and habitats is a major threat to biodiversity (Hobbs &amp; Yates 2003; Burgman et al. 2007). Among the many impacts are changes to fire regimes brought about by changes in sources and frequency of ignition and continuity of fuel loads. In some landscapes, fragments experience an increase in fire frequency (one component of a fire regime) because they are exposed to more intensive use by humans and greater sources and frequency of ignition (Kemper et al. 1999; Tabarelli &amp; Gascon 2005). In other landscapes, the displacement of traditional human societies and active fire management practices, discontinuous vegetation cover and/or advances in fire suppression cause declines in fire frequency in fragments (Ross et al. 2002; Hobbs &amp; Yates 2003). </p>
<p>Changes in fire regimes can have substantial impacts on plant species composition and abundance. Extremes of fire frequency and scale may cause local population declines or extinctions (Bradstock et al. 2002). Long intervals between fires risk the decline or loss of species that recruit exclusively or predominately in the post-fire environment if the interval between fires exceeds plant and seed longevity, and/or risk an ecologically dysfunctional abundance of certain fire-susceptible species (Withers &amp; Ashton 1977; Burgman &amp; Lamont 1992; Yates &amp; Ladd 2005). Alternatively, fires that are too frequent can also cause species decline, either directly (if fire frequency is less than the juvenile period for obligate-seeding species, or if these species otherwise fail to recruit post-fire), or indirectly, through facilitating weed invasion (Hobbs &amp; Yates 2003; Yates et al. 2003).</p>
<p>South-western Western Australia (SWWA) is a globally significant hotspot for plant diversity and endemism (Hopper &amp; Gioia 2004). However, the native vegetation of large parts of this region has been extensively cleared for agriculture. In parts of the wheatbelt, as little as 2-3% of the native vegetation remains (Hobbs &amp; Saunders 1992), existing in fragments of varying sizes, shapes, degree of isolation, tenures, history and landuses, and surrounded by agricultural land. The wheatbelt region has historically experienced fires, and many plants possess traits that enable them to persist and prosper in a fire-prone environment (Burrows &amp; Abbott 2003). Many fragments are characterized by long intervals between fires (Brown &amp; Hopkins 1983; Hobbs &amp; Atkins 1991) and may be experiencing a different contemporary fire regime from the regime prior to land clearance (Yates et al. 1994; Hobbs 2003; McCaw &amp; Hanstrum 2003). </p>
<p>Partly as a consequence of perceived differences in fire regimes in fragments, and the subsequent biodiversity conservation problems this may pose (together with asset protection concerns), recent steps have been taken to increase active fire management in the southern wheatbelt region, particularly in larger fragments (McClusky et al. 2003). Prior to this management change, most fires resulted from lightning strike or escapes from neighboring agricultural properties, and were actively suppressed in native vegetation (McClusky et al. 2003). </p>
<p>While the responses of some individual species and communities to particular fire regimes or fire events have been studied (Yates et al. 2003; Yates &amp; Ladd 2004), what may constitute an appropriate fire regime for biodiversity conservation in this region is poorly understood. Regional knowledge of upper and lower limits of fire intervals for plant communities is lacking, which prevents the definition of appropriate fire-return interval ranges. </p>
<p>Gaining this understanding of fire responses is also compromised by the lack of knowledge of landscape and historical patterns of fire, and how these may relate to current landscape configurations. An understanding of fire history is also important for interpreting current patterns of vegetation composition (Bond and van Wilgen 1996).</p>
<p>DEC uses a variety of methods prior to wildfire events to reduce the risk of fires to life, property and natural assets (Shedley 2007). One of these, scrub rolling or chaining, consists of a chained strip of natural vegetation, which is burnt at a later date. This technique facilitates fuel reduction by rendering prescribed burns easier to manage (via reduced flame heights) and initiate (through creating a more continuous fuel bed and drier fuel) (McCaw and Smith 1992). Scrub rolling and burning has the potential to have significant impacts on plant communities. Vegetation rolling (without subsequent fire) can change the composition of the vegetation community (Pelton and Conran 2002). The use of fire after chaining adds additional possibilities for impacts on vegetation, through the complex interactions of fire and plant characteristics. Some plant fire response types may be more vulnerable to burning after chaining than others. Obligate seeding species with canopy stored seed may be particularly at risk, as seed capsules may open due to desiccation following plant or shoot death after chaining, leaving the seeds unprotected during the subsequent fire (McCaw and Smith 1992; Shedley 2007). In a study of two serotinous species, McCaw and Smith (1992) found that one (Hakea pandanicarpa spp. crassifolia) released seeds soon after chaining, but another (Banksia baxteri) did not. Consequently, they recommended burning within ‘a few’ weeks of chaining to reduce the risk of local loss of serotinous species. The effects of scrub rolling and burning on other plant fire response types, other serotinous genera and species, and the vegetation community as a whole, has not been studied.</p>","<p>The various components of this project will provide much needed data for informing ecological fire management in plant communities that are widely distributed across Wheatbelt and South Coast Region Nature Reserves. Specifically:</p>
<p>1.   Investigating the recent fire history of vegetation fragments in the wheatbelt will increase our understanding of how recent landscape change affects fire regimes, and how current fire regimes may differ from that expected in areas of extensive equivalent vegetation. </p>
<p>2.   Investigating the responses of mallee and mallee-heath communities to increased time since fire will address one of the key information gaps limiting ecologically appropriate fire management in the wheatbelt; that of an appropriate fire return interval for these communities. </p>
<p>3.   Investigating the impacts of scrub-rolling on mallee-heath vegetation will provide data for analysis of the benefits to and impacts on biodiversity of this management treatment.</p>
<p>4.   Investigating the relationship between fire, landscape position and annual grass invasion will provide data on the risk of invasions following fire. </p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

363,"<p>The triggerplant genus Stylidium Sw. (Stylidiaceae) is renowned for its unique pollination mechanism in which pollen is transferred via a touch-sensitive floral column. With almost 300 known taxa, it is one of the most abundant and diversified genera in Australia. Approximately 70% of species are endemic in south-west W.A., with a secondary area of diversity in the tropical monsoon biome (which includes the Kimberley region) and relatively few species across the remainder of the continent. There are eight species in south-east Asia and one in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Substantial progress has been made over the past 20 years in documenting Australia’s Stylidium diversity. Some 87 taxa have been formally described during that period: 60 from south-west W.A. (Carlquist &amp; Lowrie 1989; Lowrie &amp; Carlquist 1991; Kenneally 1992; Lowrie &amp; Kenneally 1994a, 1997a &amp; c, 1998a-b, 2000, 2004; Lowrie et al. 1998, 1999; Wege 2005, 2006a–f, 2007a, 2008; Wege &amp; Coates 2007; Wege et al. 2007); 25 from northern Australia (Bean 1999a-b, 2000; Lowrie &amp; Kenneally 1994b, 1996, 1997b, 1998b, 1999); and two from south-eastern Australia (Jackson &amp; Wiltshire 2001; Raulings &amp; Ladiges 2001). Furthermore, a number of taxa have been reinstated or redefined following examination of type material (e.g. Bean 1999b, 2000; Jackson &amp; Wiltshire 2001; Lowrie et al. 1999; Raulings &amp; Ladiges 2001; Wege 2006b &amp; d, 2007a). </p>
<p>In W.A., this research effort, combined with an intensive period of floristic survey and inventory, has resulted in the State’s herbarium collections more than doubling in size to c. 11, 000 accessions. Over the past six years, a significant amount of time has been allocated to sorting sections of this collection, resulting in the discovery of 40 new taxa (Wege 2005, 2006a, c &amp; e-f, 2007a, 2008; Wege et al. 2007; Western Australian Herbarium 1998–) and a considerable improvement in our understanding of the distribution and rarity of many taxa.</p>
<p>Despite this productive phase of taxonomic research, knowledge of Stylidium remains insufficient for scientific and conservation needs. There are more than 30 taxa, mostly from W.A., that require formal description (Bostock &amp; Holland 2007; Western Australian Herbarium 2008–), and numerous species complexes remain poorly understood. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive checklist and synonymy and there are a number of nomenclature and typification issues that require resolution. Progress continues to be made in this respect (e.g. Bean 1999b, 2000; Wege 2006b&amp;d, 2007a&amp;b, 2009).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant issue at this point in time, particularly in south-west W.A., is the lack of readily accessible diagnostic information for end-users of the existing taxonomy. Whilst there are identification guides to the species of northern Australia (Bean 1999b, 2000), there is no up-to-date key to the triggerplants of southern Australia. This makes accurate identification by conservation personnel, botanical consultants and other stakeholders highly problematic and presents a major impediment to survey and conservation assessments. This is especially concerning in southern W.A., where more than 70 taxa are listed as Declared Rare or Priority Flora, the majority of which require further survey to understand the full extent of their distribution.</p>
<p>To date, phylogenetic research has focused on generic relationships within Stylidiaceae rather than relationships within Stylidium (Laurent et al. 1998; Wagstaff &amp; Wege 2002). With its high species diversity, spectacular floral variation, unique and precise pollination system (Armbruster et al. 1994), and chromosome number diversity (James 1979), Stylidium is an excellent study system for investigating a broad array of evolutionary questions. The recent improvements in our taxonomic understanding of the genus will provide the necessary platform for such studies.</p>","<p>This SPP directly addresses the central purpose and role of the DEC Science Division: to provide up-to-date and scientifically sound information to uphold effective, evidence-based conservation of biodiversity and sustainable natural resource management in Western Australia.

370,"<p>Assessing the status and trends in the condition of biodiversity assets assists DEC to fulfill its statutory responsibilities for the conservation of the State’s biodiversity. The systematic long-term monitoring, evaluation and reporting (MER) of asset condition-pressure-response (CPR) is a key strategy for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of management action within Western Australia’s system of marine protected areas (MPAs). MER programs also determined whether conservation goals (i.e. outcomes) are being achieved. Marine management strategies include the use of zoning schemes and regulations to control human activities, compliance monitoring, public participation and community education programs and direct management intervention.  The early detection of ecosystem change through strategic MER programs allows for the modification of these management practices to changing ecosystem condition and threats within an adaptive management context.  </p>
<p>The Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP) was established in 2008 within DEC’s Marine Science Program to coordinate the MER of marine biodiversity asset (e.g. finfish, seagrass, and coral communities etc.) CPR status and trends within Western Australia’s MPAs.  A key biodiversity asset of WA MPAs is finfish. Finfish are listed as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) within most WA MPAs, highlighting their biodiversity significance, social and economic value. Finfish in most MPAs are under considerable anthropogenic pressure from recreational and, to a lesser extent, commercial fishing activities.</p>
<p>In shallow, coastal waters, the condition of fish communities has traditionally been monitored, using a technique known as Underwater Visual Census (UVC; Ayling and Ayling 1987; Connell et al. 1998; Samoilys and Carlos 2000; Layman et al. 2004; Williamson et al. 2004; Hobbs et al. 2008).  More recently, a technique for assessing finfish community condition has been developed that utilises stereo-video to capture imagery of fish communities which is later analysed in the laboratory (Watson et al. 2005, 2010; Shedrawi 2008; McLaren 2009; Langlois et al. 2010).  Known as Diver Operated Video (DOV), this technique has potential advantages over UVC because sampling theoretically requires less scientific expertise, takes less time in the field and data analysts have access to reference material to help identify fish,. In addition, it provides a permanent record of the survey that can be checked or revisited at a later point if required. However, DOV datasets are significantly more costly to process and it is unclear if video imagery captures the same level of diversity and abundance as skilled divers conducting UVC. </p>
<p>Despite the significant amount of DOV surveys that have been completed in fish communities in WA over recent years, no thorough investigation comparing the overall utility, results and cost-effectiveness of this technique to conventional UVC methods has been conducted. As such, comparable assessments need to be undertaken to assess the relative utility of these techniques in both temperate and tropical waters where WAMMP has monitoring responsibilities and to better understand the value of historical UVC and DOV datasets. This is especially relevant given the staff constraints (outlined above) and the significant financial and time constraints placed on activities conducted by WAMMP.</p>","<p>The outcomes of this project are:</p>
<p>i)     An improved understanding of the comparability of UVC and DOV methods for measuring diversity, abundance and size information of finfish communities.  This will facilitate better alignment of historical UVC data with existing DOV data and vice-versa and allow DEC to better assess the utility of historical time-series of fish community information for use in WAMMP.  These datasets would be confounded without such a study.</p>
<p>ii)    An improved understanding of the applicability to regional staff and relative costs of each survey technique as a monitoring tool for fish communities in tropical and temperate marine ecosystems.  This will allow WAMMP to more effectively select between the two survey techniques.</p>
<p>iii)    Acquisition of further data on the status of finfish communities within JBMP, MBIMP and RSMP.</p>

372,"<p>The flora of Western Australia is still inadequately known (Gibson, Coates &amp; Thiele, 2007, Nuytsia 17: 1-12). The state is under-explored botanically, and the existing herbarium collections are insufficiently studied. New taxa that are readily recognised as such are still being discovered, for example in <em>Wurmbea</em> where a revision and summary Flora of Australia treatment were published in the past (Macfarlane 1980, 1987) and it might have been expected that only a few additional species might be found. However in South Australia Bates () described xx new species and subspecies as a result of extensive field observations over a number of years, and in Western Australia a similar pattern has been occurring. Whilst few new taxa have turned up in the relatively well-studied south west within the forest and agricultural regions, a remarkable 20 or so new species have been discovered or separated from existing ones through a number of years of field work at appropriate seasons in the pastoral, goldfields and desert areas. Other new species are often detected in the exisiting herbarium collections as plant groups are critically studied taxonomically, some recent examples being Williams (2007) in <em>Puccinellia,</em> Hislop (2009) in <em>Leucopogon</em> and Rye (2009) in <em>Oxymyrrhine,</em> or as a result of geographically-based surveys, e.g. Keighery (2008) in Lomandra, Shepherd &amp; Lyons (2009) and Macfarlane et al. (2010) in several genera. There are many more taxa where existing variation is not properly catered for by available identification keys, so that users are unable to satisfactorily assign a significant proportion of specimens. Identification keys are not available or are outdated or inadequate for many plant groups with much reliance still placed on the now variously aged parts of Blackall &amp; Grieve (Blackall &amp; Grieve 1954 to Grieve 1998) so that identifying specimens from, for example, environmental surveys, is more laborious and uncertain than it should be. Conservation of the flora is held back by these difficulties because taxa need to be defined with reasonable certainty to justify the resources needed for specific protective measures, and they need to be identifiable by regional staff and they need to be formally named according to standard scientific procedures. Whilst there are new conventional keys for some groups (e.g. Wheeler 2004, Rye 2009), interactive keys for others (Sharp &amp; Simon , Rye et al. in prep.), and plans in process for integrated identification systems in FloraBase,  there remains an ongoing need for the basic research that will provide the authoritative and accurate taxon concepts and character information to put into those keying systems and in turn to service the users.</p>","<ul>

378,"<p>At a meeting held on 18/12/2007 at Kings Park attended by Greg Woodman, Cathy Godden (Woodman Environmental Consulting), DEC research staff (David Coates, Kevin Thiele) and BGPA research staff (Kingsley Dixon, Siegy Krauss, Matt Barrett, Russell Barrett, Mark Wallace), the need to understand population genetic variation and structure in DRF _Acacia woodmaniorum _Maslin &amp; Buscomb and _A. karina _Maslin &amp; Buscomb was identified.  This understanding was deemed critical to identify potential impacts from proposed mining activities on genetic diversity within these species and subsequent impacts on population, and species, viability.  It was also considered important to understand the evolutionary relationships between these rare species and their more common close relatives and whether their rarity is associated with habitat specialisation or historical circumstances linked possibly to past climatic events. As a result Karara mining provided funding for the appropriate research.  . </p>
<p>Acacia woodmaniorum is a recently described species (Maslin &amp; Buscumb 2007) endemic to the Blue Hill Banded Ironstone Ranges of the Midwest region of south-west Western Australia.  The Blue Hills area occurs on the interface between the South West Botanical Province and the arid Eremaean Province.  The taxa is listed as Declared Rare Flora on DEC’s “Declared Rare and Priority Flora List” (Atkins 2006).  <em>Acacia woodmaniorum _is a member of _Acacia</em> sect. Alatae (Benth.) Pedley thought to be most closely aligned to <em>A. alata</em> R. Br., and in particular, to the most northerly distributed variety of that species, var. _biglandulosa _Benth. (Maslin &amp; Buscumb 2007).  _Acacia woodmaniorum _was discovered in 1992 by Ray Cranfield, and the most significant collections of the species were made between 2004 and 2006 by staff from Woodman Environmental Consulting and DEC (Maslin &amp; Buscumb 2007).  _Acacia woodmaniorum _is known from around 28,000 plants found in just three populations located on top of Mungada Ridge and Jasper Hill, over an area of about 40km<sup>2</sup>. All three populations occur in an area covered by mining exploration leases.</p>
<p>Understanding the distribution of genetic diversity and key processes that may influence that distribution are likely to be critical for assessing a range of possible management actions that will maximise the persistence of populations of _Acacia woodmaniorum _where genetic diversity may already be limited due to rarity.  The outcomes of this project are a detailed knowledge of the levels and distribution of genetic diversity and key processes such as the mating system and patterns of gene flow that may influence that distribution as well as confirmation of the putatively related taxa.  The project is innovative in using molecular genetic techniques to assess the impact of mining activities on species genetic diversity and infer the potential effects of reduced diversity on population persistence.  Results of the project will have significant regional impact at the local scale specifically for any mining and conservation activities undertaken across the species range.</p>","<p>The outcomes of this project will include </p>
<ol>
<li>A detailed knowledge of the level of genetic diversity present in A. woodmaniorum, the distribution of population genetic variation across the species spatial distribution and fine scale patterns of spatial structure within populations.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary distinctness of A. woodmaniorum to putatively related taxa.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the patterns of phylogeography of A. woodmaniorum and related taxa across the landscape.</li>
<li>Knowledge of key population genetic processes including the mating system (degree of correlated paternity, degree of outcrossing) and levels and patterns of gene flow and migration in A. woodmaniorum.</li>
</ol>
<p>This information will be used to inform the funding body Karara Mining Ltd on the possible impacts of various mining activities on the maintenance of genetic diversity in A. woodmaniorum and on appropriate seed sampling regimes when sourcing seed for restoration purposes.  The outcomes will have direct benefits for DEC in the conservation management of the species in situ, as it occurs on the DEC conservation reserve.  Knowledge provided by the project outcomes can be used to ensure the maintenance of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential in the species and also adds to the knowledge base of the evolutionary development of native taxa throughout the Midwest.</p>",,,"[[""Role"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Volunteer"", """", """", """"], [""Collaborator"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"", """", """", """"], [""External Funding"", """", """", """"]]",,,

383,"<p>Biological Survey in Western Australia routinely uncovers new taxa of conservation interest (Keighery et al., 2007). The initial identification of a potential new taxon of conservation significance may result in a note in the survey report, or a formal synopsis with a conservation ranking. </p>
<p>However, there is often a considerable time lag (up to 20 years) between the recognition of a potentially new taxon of conservation significance and its eventual formal taxonomic description. For example Keighery (2009) validated six species of Darwinia which up to that time were segregated under manuscript or phrase names at PERTH, to enable conservation listing (Atkins, 2005). Thus, the concerns noted by Orchard (2006) about the perpetuation and de-facto validation of such informal names, in the literature that…..""In many cases these 'temporary' names are still in use 10-15 years later"" will be addressed.</p>

416,"<p>The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) is responsible for conservation of the State’s biodiversity. Under Australia’s obligation as a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (29th December 1993), a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas is being progressively established throughout Australia's marine jurisdiction by Commonwealth, State and the Northern Territory governments (ANZECC TFMPA 1999). As part of this process DEC, on behalf of the State Government, is establishing a comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) system of marine protected areas (MPAs) throughout the coastal waters of Western Australia. These MPA’s are vested (legally entrusted) in the independent Marine Parks and Reserves Authority (MPRA) on behalf of all Western Australians under the provisions of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984. DEC also has the legislative responsibility for conservation of marine fauna and flora across all State’s lands and waters. </p>
<p>The importance of implementing a standard approach to monitoring, evaluation and reporting (MER) for assets of State and National significance is receiving greater recognition on the road to National biodiversity reporting (e.g. State of the Environment reports and National environmental accounting). Long-term monitoring of condition, pressure and management response in relation to ecological and related social assets (see Appendix A), along with evaluation and reporting is a key element of determining whether management and conservation objectives are being met and if the State is getting ‘value for money’ from their marine management and conservation programs. </p>
<p>In response to this need, DEC has established the Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP) which is a statewide long-term, institutional marine MER program currently being developed and implemented primarily to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of MPA and threatened marine fauna biodiversity management and conservation programs. To facilitate and promote management effectiveness WAMMP delivers information on the extent and cause of change in the marine environment using systematic and standardised approaches to data collection, evaluation and reporting over extended periods. Trends in the condition[1] (C) of biodiversity assets is a result of the interplay between natural and anthropogenic[2] pressures (P) and the effectiveness of the management response/s (R) to mitigate these pressures. The primary purpose of MER programs is to provide the asset-based CPR data and trends that are needed to inform adaptive management. MER programs must therefore be designed to ensure that, when changes in asset condition trends are detected, an assessment can be made of whether these changes are caused primarily by natural, anthropogenic or climate change pressures.</p>
<p>The WAMMP provides quantitative evidence of condition, pressure and management response changes to support the MPRA’s statutory audit function of MPA’s.  WAMMP will also inform Marine Policy and Planning in DEC’s specialist branches and will collaborate with other State and Commonwealth agencies, NGO’s, local communities and industry that have responsibilities or a special interest in marine management and conservation.</p>
<p>The WAMMP is primarily a partnership between the Marine Science Program (MSP) and the marine staff of the Regional Services Division. The WAMMP is coordinated from the Marine Science Program in DEC’s Science Division by a coordinator who helps to oversee the planning and delivery of program activity, and facilitates input and collaboration from other government agencies and statutory bodies, industry and community groups. The WAMMP has permanent staffing positions allocated to support this strategic focus, with a central science capability in Perth (i.e MSP) and operational support (i.e. marine staff in Regional Services Division) located in regional centers throughout WA (Appendix B). As management agencies cannot comprehensively and effectively manage on their own and the marine environment is owned by all West Australians, DEC benefits greatly from the help of the broader community. </p>
<hr />
<p>[1] Expressed as asset structure and function</p>
<p>[2] Climate change is an emerging anthropogenic pressure on natural systems worldwide. Because of the potential significance and large temporal and spatial scales involved, CC pressures are treated separately from local scale anthropogenic pressures within the current context. </p>","<p>As part of annual review of WAMMP outputs there is both an internal DEC MPA asset review process and published MPRA performance assessment reports. Outputs from these documents inform the MPRA annual report to Parliament. WAMMP outputs incorporate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refined historical CPR records for Marine Park assets and threatened fauna;</li>
<li>On-going quantitative evidence on the status and trends in selected indicators of condition of assets, the pressure/s on these assets and DEC management responses; </li>
<li>Data to meet legislated audit requirements, and allow measurement of progress towards asset condition, management performance and visitor enjoyment goals; </li>
<li>Information and understanding of the dynamic nature of undisturbed marine ecosystems; </li>
</ul>
<p>In recent years managers and civil society are increasingly becoming aware of the value of long time-series datasets as MER provides a better means of learning from past experience, improving service delivery, planning and allocating resources, and demonstrating results as part of accountability to key stakeholders. This performance assessment and adaptive management framework allows conservation managers to respond appropriately to changes as they become apparent and through measurement, adaptation and delivery cycles, refine our approach to managing ecological and social assets.</p>
<p>The WAMMP provides a formalized assessment to determine warning signals of critical condition change to WA marine assets before these change occur. This improved understanding of the effect of key natural (e.g. temperature, coral predators, disease etc) and human pressures (e.g. fishing, dredging, coastal development) allows time for the development of effective mitigation measures to restore, maintain and manage marine biodiversity.</p>
<p>Data from protected environments also offers complementary understanding to information from the resource extraction (e.g. commercial fishing) and industrial (e.g. offshore drilling, port dredging) sectors. WAMMP data can act as a reference point for comparisons with altered environments, and assist State agencies, regulators and developers in better determining and understanding anthropogenic impacts.</p>
<p>Multi-decadal programs like WAMMP require consistent delivery of data that conforms to agreed standards and has defined quality assurance and quality control processes in place. WAMMP needs systems to facilitate regular i) capture of data, with a place to ii) upload, iii) store, iv) discover and access data. Lastly WAMMP needs to be able to design and produce reports from automated work flows that deliver standardised reporting products from defined raw data sets.  Provision by WAMMP of time-series of asset condition, pressure and management response information captures the corporate history of what DEC has learnt about changes in asset condition, pressures and the effectiveness of management. This helps DEC managers and the community learn through time, and not suffer the ‘shifting baselines’ phenomenon as DEC staff and community change. Information management frameworks that manage the collection, entry, quality control and archival of data-sets, and makes them available to contribute to adaptive conservation management for the full lifecycle of WAMMP will be a major benefit to DEC. The development of these systems and processes to service the needs of WAMMP will also have significant flow on benefits to daily operation and the strategic capacity of DEC.</p>
<p>Recognising the ‘value for money’ imperative, DEC has moved towards an outcome orientated business model that re-affirms the link between management activity and conservation outcomes described in DEC strategic plans and government legislation. WAMMP will play an important part in assisting the re-alignment of work practice and culture, by helping adapt and better integrate DEC business architecture (financial and operational work planning and work-flow designs) and re-focusing effort across work programs to jointly achieve strategic conservation and management objectives.</p>","<p>The WAMMP is primarily based on a partnership model between a centralised science capability (DEC’s Marine Science Program) and operations divisions (Nature Conservation and Parks and Visitors Services) located in regional centres of interest. Also included as part of the WAMMP are key specialist branches of DEC (e.g. Environmental Management Branch, Marine Policy and Planning Branch, Nature Protection Branch, Species and Communities Branch). In undertaking the MER process DEC will collaborate with other agencies that have responsibilities or a special interest in conservation management and the community.</p>","<p>The project addresses or contributes to strategies in the following documents:</p>

1302,"<p>Australian Snubfin and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins inhabit Australia's tropical north-western coastline. Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins occur across Australia's entire northwest coast including resident populations at Ningaloo Marine Park and likely Dampier Archipelago as well as further north into the Kimberley.  The snubfin dolphin is endemic to Northern Australia with identified resident populations in Cygnet Bay and Roebuck Bay in the Kimberley. While this species has been sighted occasionally in the Pilbara, their presence and use of this area is yet to be determined, however the Pilbara likely represents the southern extreme of their range.</p>
<p>Both the snubfin and humpback dolphin remain very poorly known in WA, and our limited understanding of the animals' distribution, abundance, habitat usage, and population dynamics has so far precluded the assessment of the species' conservation status in northern Australia. In particular, while there are limited population size estimates available for these species from other jurisdictions across their known range (Cleveland Bay, Queensland and Port Essington, Northern Territory.), abundance estimates are not yet available for the Kimberley region of WA, and although research has commenced recently in this area, the abundance and distribution remains poorly understood across their range. As a result, in 2012 the Minister for Environment has identified filling information gaps on this species as a high research priority.  Further, a prioritization exercise undertaken in WA to set strategic priorities for research on marine mammals in WA identified fundamental research questions on coastal dolphins as a high priority to begin to inform some of the important management issues relevant to these species given the growing impacts in coastal environments of the northwest. </p>","<p>This research will enable a better understanding of these dolphin species across their range in northwest WA including distribution, habitat use, movement and connectivity, abundance and diet. This information will be used in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes to evaluate and mitigate potential impacts on coastal dolphins by informing the appropriateness of proposed developments.</p>
<ul>
<li>The density, timing and location of coastal dolphins will be identified and mapped across the Pilbara to allow managers to assess conflicts with potential pressures.</li>
<li>Foraging habitat and key prey species will be identified which can be used to assess potential overlap with pressures such as habitat loss from coastal development and competition with fisheries.</li>
<li>Populations will be defined for coastal dolphin species (Indo-pacific humpback, bottlenose and snubfin) which will allow managers to place importance on those populations/species under more pressure or with restricted distributions</li>
<li>Results on abundance and density of snubfin dolphins for a key site (Roebuck Bay) will enable a comparison with abundance estimates made at other sites in QLD and NT and better assessment of their conservation status at a State and National level.</li>
<li>Baseline data will be available to inform ongoing regional monitoring and management.</li>

<p>Planned burning on lands managed by DBCA is undertaken in accordance with the international standard for risk management ISO 31000. A comprehensive prescribed fire plan is prepared for each job specifying the purpose of the burn, the risk management context, actions required to implement the burn, and the process for closure and evaluation. Prescribed fire plans include a statement of objectives relevant to the purpose of the burn, typically of the form:</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide strategic protection against damaging bush fire to identified assets (X, Y, Z) by the application of fire under prescribed conditions to reduce the quantity of fuel;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To protect, maintain and enhance biodiversity values and ecological processes by creating a mosaic of fire intensities and burnt and unburnt areas at local and landscape scale.</p>
<p>Success criteria are also specified, for example</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A range (X-Y%) burnt in each cell treatment;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achievement of a mosaic of fuel age, burn season, scorch heights and intensities;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identified exclusion zones are excluded from fire (eg. habitat for particular species);</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No significantly continuous areas of defoliation within the burns;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all riparian areas are burnt in the same season.</p>
<p>Preparation and approval of a prescribed fire plan requires substantial commitment of staff time to planning and consultation. Substantial resources are also engaged in operational implementation of the plan. However, DBCA does not currently have a systematic approach to monitoring, information gathering and reporting on the outcomes of planned burning. While elements of each of these activities are done following most planned burns this occurs in an ad-hoc way, and information is dispersed to different users across the Department to meet statutory reporting obligations that include fire management performance indicators and Permits to take Declared Rare Flora.</p>

<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">The study areas where PMB (AKA Soft Edge Mosaic burning, by fire practitioners) is being actively implemented within prescriptions is in the Milyeannup area south of Nannup (Blackwood district) and in forest blocks NE of Collie (Wellington District). All prescribed burning and wildfires across the SW generally represent a mosaic at some scale, with patchy fire outcomes a typical objective of forest area burn prescriptions. New remote sensing technologies now allow us to map fine grain mosaics in forest landscapes for the first time. Using this technology, PMB outcomes will be compared between SEM and adjacent forest blocks under conventional prescriptions. Mosaic complexity will be characterised across a range of vegetation types (jarrah, riparian, wandoo, heath), in relation to PMB treatments, and more broadly across the south west, to assess the biodiversity outcomes of realised fire mosaics in DBCA managed lands.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=""{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"">&nbsp;</span></p>

Cultural, fire risk, and biodiversity management benefits have been put forward in support of the re-introduction of mosaic burning practices in SW forests. On the other hand, short fire intervals potentially resulting from high fire frequency&nbsp; is a potential threateneing process for sensative species. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Precedents for the practice of PMB in WA include the Walpole fine mosaic project (a Science-Warren Region collaboration), and the northern savanna PMB project (a Science Kimberley Region collaboration). Despite these precedents, PMB outcomes remain to be assessed at scale for forests, especially relative to current prescribed burning programs which burn whole blocks. DBCA&rsquo;s SW Region has commenced implementation of a soft edge mosaic burn prescription at two large sites, aiming to deliver a balance between improved risk reduction and biodiversity conservation through frequent introduction of fine-grained burns into the landscape.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that forest species richness of many groups is resilient to a range of fire regimes. Resilient groups include bird assemblages, most vascular flora, ground active invertebrates, some obligate seeder species and some small mammal species.&nbsp;</p>

Python predation, especially when populations are small or under pressure from drought or other predators, can potentially reduce adult survival as well as curtailing recruitment. This is particularly problematic when threatened mammal populations are highly confined by availability of habitat or if housed in enclosures for breeding or conservation. Current &ldquo;predator proof&rdquo; fences used to protect WA threatened mammal fauna, while effective at reducing or eliminating predation by foxes and feral cats, are likely to have little or no effect on levels of python predation.</p>
<p>The draft Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroo Recovery Plan (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2016) identified python predation as a significant threat to the growth of the potoroo population in the Waychinicup NP enclosure. A total of 49 potoroos have been placed in this enclosure since 2010 and there have been 8 known python predation events of potoroos with tail radio-transmitters. Since only a proportion of potoroos are fitted with tail transmitters at any time, the number actually taken by pythons is likely to be much higher. Tail transmitters typically only stay attached to the tail for 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>The estimated size of the potoroo population inside the enclosure in May 2016 was just 12 individuals. In a recent review of options following the Two Peoples Bay fire, it was stated that without management intervention, python predation was likely to cause their extinction within the enclosure (Tony Friend, options paper, December 2015). It appears that python predation is limiting population growth and hence the production of progeny for translocation to other sites.</p>
<p>This project will examine ways to detect and capture pythons so they can be removed from sites where the Gilbert's Potoroo exists, especially the Waychinicup enclosure.</p>

<p>The research outcome will inform the effectiveness and practicality of an alternative methods for monitoring phytoplankton in the Swan Canning estuary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The use of fluorescence readings for generating key information such as spatio-temporal variation of phytoplankton, vertical movement of phytoplankton groups, and key physico-chemical driving factors has the potential to value add to existing approaches. In addition, fluorometery may enable more targeted approaches to monitoring phytoplankton by identifiying hotspots of activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Importantly, information generated during the project (and as a consequence of any technology update resulting from the project) will feed directly into the improvement of decision support systems such as the Swan Canning Estuarine Response Model (SCERM). Chl-<em>a</em> is a metric the model is less accurate at predicting and the data from these project should yield better results in this area. Recent assessment of the SCERM has indicated that model improvement and further data validation would benefit from high frequency water quality monitoring equipment and data from cross-stream transects. Successful calibration and evaluation of multi-waveband fluorometers will enable effective and targeted use of modern technology to collect these desired data</p>","<p>There is a collaboration with another DBCA science project, with&nbsp;Murdoch University and CSIRO, to investigate use of another technology - FlowCAM (imaging flow cytometer).</p>","<p>Rivers and Estuaries Branch is currently reviewing the SWANEST and CANEST environmental monitoring programs to ensure that data collection suits the strategic needs of the Division, provides data that addresses management issues and fills knowledge gaps while working within budgetary requirements. Use of cheap, rapid data streams to provide greater time and/or spatial resolution to environmental sampling is a key consideration during this process as such data would provide immense benefit to management via enhanced response capabilities, increase understanding of system dynamics and informing and improved quatitative hydrodynamic model of the estuary.</p>
<p>This project addresses multiple Themes under the <strong>Science Strategic Plan 2018-21</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

The estimates of chl-<em>a</em> concentration derived from this fluorescence data are considered qualitative to semi-quantitative and are not used in any reporting. Weekly (integrated) or fortnightly (surface) water samples collected at each of the main phytoplankton sampling sites, for each program, are processed for chlorophyll in a laboratory and it is these data that are used in reporting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The fluorescence data, though not currently used in reporting, is extremely useful in rapid assessment of potential microalgal biomass and provides resolution through the depth of the water column rather than an integrated value across the water column. This can help identify where microalgae may be occurring in a lens at a specific depth. A high fluorescence signal can help target further sampling or investigation.</p>
<p>Many national and international water quality monitoring programs use fluorescence-based estimates of chl-<em>a</em> quantitatively as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Prime benefits of this method are its low cost and near real-time output. Most programs pair this method with limited pigment and phytoplankton measurements for calibration/verification of fluorescence data. New multi-wavelength instruments that use multiple LEDs of different spectral bands to both more accurately estimate chl-<em>a</em> and provide gross taxonomic characterisation (e.g. cyanobacteria, green, golden-brown (diatoms and dinoflagellates) and cryptophytes) are being applied in the field. This new fluorometer technology will be combined with machine learning techniques to draw the most from the data produced.</p>"

<p>The State Government purchased the pastoral leases Lorna Glen and Earaheedy in 2000.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Lorna Glen area (244,000ha) has been actively managed by DBCA and its predecessors in partnership with the Martu people since the purchase. Since 2000,&nbsp;two DBCA Science and Conservation Projects have focussed on restoring the natural ecosystem at MKK. In 2003,&nbsp;<em>Project Rangelands Restoration: developing sustainable management systems for the conservation of biodiversity at the landscape scale in rangelands of the Murchison and Gascoyne bioregions--managing fire and introduced predators</em> (SPP 2003-004) was initiated. &nbsp;This project was a revision of RPP 60/90 (Project Desert Dreaming) and superceded 60/90 (SCP 2002/06). This project focused on restoring patch-burn dynamics, and reducing the abundance of feral herbivores to restore the native vegetation on MKK. In 2012, the project <em>Rangelands restoration: reintroduction of native mammals to Lorna Glen (Matuwa)</em> (SPP 2012-024) was funded by the&nbsp;DBCA Science and Conservation Division, Goldfields Region and the Chevron Gorgon Gas Project &ndash; fauna translocation offset fund. This project focussed on reintroducing native fauna species to the open MKK landscape, and for species particularly vulnerable to predation, translocated species into a predator-free compound on Matuwa. Exclusive Native Title was awarded over both pastoral leases in 2014 and they now form the Matuwa Kurrara Kurrara Indigenous Protected Area (MKK IPA) that has a formal indigenous management group (Tarlka Matuwa Piarku Aboriginal Corporation, TMPAC) who approve all activities.

However the properties were never formally converted to conservation reserve and in 2015 the former pastoral properties became the Matuwa Kurrara Kurrara (MKK) Indigenous Protected Area, following their declaration as exclusive possession Native Title for the Martu traditional owners. It is now&nbsp;managed by the Tarlka Matuwa Piarku Aboriginal Corporation (TMPAC), and an MoU and Agreement between DBCA and TMPAC regarding ongoing conservation management at MKK are currently in preparation.</p>
<p>The Rangelands Restoration project commenced on Lorna Glen (now MKK) in 2000 with the destocking of the pastoral leases and turning off&nbsp;the artificial waters. In 2005 feral cat control through an annual aerial baiting was commenced, and in 2007 - 2008 bilbies and brushtail possums were successfully reintroduced. A fire managment plan that aimed to reinstate a fine-grained fire-induced habitat mosaic, was also implemented and control of feral herbivores (primarily camels) commenced. In 2009, an 1,100 ha fenced enclosure was constructed&nbsp;to protect threatened mammals from introduced predators. In 2010&nbsp;Chevron Gorgon offset funding (until 2023) allowed the stocking of the fenced enclosure with golden bandicoots and boodies from Barrow Island, with the aim that these would become the source for reintroductions to MKK outside the fence. Mala and Shark Bay mice were also translocated to the fenced enclosure. In 2015 golden bandicoots were reintroduced to MKK.&nbsp;Biological survey of the small vertebrates has also been undertaken on MKK (currently in progress on ex-Earaheedy).</p>

Changing precipitation regimes and increasing temperatures also threaten to further modify the trajectory of ecological condition in these ecosystems, with the impact of vegetation mortality and invasive species both likely to become more pronounced in future decades. However, while the extent of degradation is widely acknowledged, it is not known whether these ecosystems have the ecological capacity to naturally recover when agricultural grazing pressures are removed or how resilient they might be to future climatic extremes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term monitoring datasets are crucial for identifying changes in ecosystem condition and evaluating the impact of management interventions. To this end, a range of field-based ecological data has been collected from long term monitoring plots in the WA rangelands over the past several decades, the most comprehensive being the Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS;&nbsp;Watson et al. 2007). However, to-date little progress has been made in synthesizing these data with other long-term datasets, including remotely-sensed data, to understand past changes in rangeland condition, the diversity of present conditions and predict likely future changes. Furthermore, past monitoring programs like WARMS have been necessarily focussed the most agriculturally productive landscapes in the rangelands, rather than for the purposes of biodiversity conservation across the landscape more broadly. Therefore, this project proposes to compile a database of existing on-ground monitoring data to be used as validation data for a landscape-wide analysis of the 33-year archive of Landsat satellite imagery and other remote sensed data.</p>

CSIRO now also manages 350,000 hectares on Boolardy Station in the Midwest for the purposes of operating the Murchison Radioastronomy Observatory and constructing the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope. These properties contain extensive tracts of degraded ecosystems presenting an ongoing management challenge. Therefore, both DBCA and CSIRO have an urgent need to understand the spatial extent of degradation across their combined property estates and the ecological trajectory of these systems.</p>"

<p>Little is known of the population ecology and genetic structure of leaf-nosed and ghost bats within the Pilbara, yet impacts to these species must be considered as Matters of National Environmental Significance (MNES) in development approvals under the EPBC Act. Understanding the distribution of genetic diversity and degree of genetic connectivity amongst populations in the rocky ranges within the Pilbara (Hamersley and Chichester Ranges) is essential for the conservation and protection of the species.

<p>A novel non-invasive genetic monitoring technique has been recently developed for the ghost bat to assist in answering some of these questions, which, for the first time, has enabled populations to be effectively monitored at regular intervals over multiple seasons with minimal disturbance. The genetic data derived from this approach is providing important insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of cave use by the ghost bat, giving estimates of the rate of cave fidelity and the spatial scale of animal movements. Further research is required to critically evaluate the non-invasive genetic monitoring approach in a formal mark-recapture analysis framework to validate its use in population censuses. Optimising the genetic mark-recapture monitoring approach will enable assessment of ghost bat population fluctuations in response to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances to assist in development of monitoring thresholds and in understanding population trajectories.</p>"

Each year, vast Departmental resources are devoted, directly and indirectly, to their conservation through predator baiting, prescribed burning, population monitoring, translocations, Indigenous liaison and working with ranger groups.</p>
<p>Rock-wallabies pose unique management challenges due to their often remote and specialised habitat (e.g. rock outcrops in the deserts or the Kimberley), a number of threats and genetic differentiation between populations, even over short distances (Telfer and Eldridge 2010). There is genetic evidence of undescribed subspecies or species within all three existing Kimberley species (Potter <em>et al</em>. 2014) and hybridization between species and subspecies (Eldridge and Pearson 1997; Eldridge <em>et al</em>. submitted). To adequately conserve each rock-wallaby taxon and population, we need to understand it&rsquo;s genetic identity, clarify it&rsquo;s distribution and threats to it's conservation, and adopt required management and effective monitoring techniques.</p>
<p>A recovery plan for all the species of rock-wallabies in WA was written to cover the period 2012-2022 (Pearson 2012), so it is timely to review progress on the management of populations (predator and competitor control, translocations) and monitoring techniques and research how these can be improved prior to the preparation of a new recovery plan.&nbsp;Due to the dispersed nature of rock-wallaby populations and because many populations are not located on conservation lands, current management actions and monitoring are conducted by a range of different land management agencies including DBCA, Indigenous land management / ranger groups and private wildlife organisations, leading to both variation in techniques but also a lack of information flow about the status of many populations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, monitoring of several rock-wallaby taxa is sporadic and often just documents the ongoing loss of populations. This project will help identify priority populations based on their demographics, genetic status and threats. It will provide guidance and mentoring on management measures and the use of appropriate monitoring. While a variety of monitoring techniques have been employed for rock-wallabies (Lavery <em>et al</em>. in prep), there remains a need to assess their relative value and establish protocols for ongoing monitoring. No one monitoring technique will suit all populations. Regional staff have indicated a need for assistance in identifying which populations should be monitored, the current threats, appropriate management techniques (e.g. fire, control of predators and competitors) and effective monitoring that can drive adaptive management.</p>
<p>This project will work with Regional staff and two indigenous ranger groups and WWF to clarify the geographic and genetic distribution of two WA rock-wallaby populations (Kidson Track population and Erskine Range population of P. lateralis kimberleyensis),&nbsp; identify monitoring requirements and the best techniques to undertake this monitoring. Trapping surveys (the most data-rich monitoring technique) will collect baseline data on population size, demographics and genetic identity for comparison with other monitoring techniques (cameras, searches for faecal pellets, sightings, drones). Some of these other techniques are already in use or are proposed to be used by DBCA and ranger groups and their relative effectiveness is largely unknown.</p>

1777,"<p>Predations by introduced predators, the red fox and feral cat,&nbsp;are regarded as the most significant threatening processes for most of Australia's threatened mammal species. Fox control, through broadscale toxic baiting under the <em>Western Shield</em> program has contributed significantly to the conservation of many native mammal species in Western Australia. However it has now been demonstrated that where fox abundance has been reduced through baiting, activity of feral cats has increased, and many of the mammal declines observed since 2000 in Western Australia are thought to be due to increased predation by feral cats.&nbsp;In 2014 the <em>Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup></em> cat bait was registered for operational use in the south-west of Western Australia, and&nbsp;an operational trial to integrate cat baiting with fox baiting is currently underway at four sites in the south-west of WA (SW Fauna Recovery Project at Kalbarri, Dryandra, Upper Warren and South Coast). Lake Magenta Nature Reserve is one of the largest wheatbelt reserves and still supports populations of threatened mammals species such as the chuditch (<em>Dasyurus geoffroii</em>), red-tailed phascogale (<em>Phascogale calura</em>) and heath mouse (<em>Pseudomys shortridgei</em>). The mesopredator research program undertaken at Lake Magenta 2006-2009 demonstrated that fox control was&nbsp;effective at reducing fox activity at Lake Magenta, compared to an unbaited control site (Dunn Rock nature reserve). It also showed&nbsp;that feral cat activity was correspondingly higher at Lake Magenta. Recent fauna surveys of Lake Magenta have detected fewer chuditch and heath mice than previously, and it is possible that predation by feral cats has replaced fox predation as a factor in these declines. This project proposes to assess the impact of introducing cat baiting to Lake Magenta nature reserve, and&nbsp;integrating this with the current fox baiting regime being implemented there.</p>","<ul>

<li>To ensure existing populations of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo are returned to and maintained at sustainable levels and that genetic diversity is maximised.</li>
<li>To increase the number of populations and individuals of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve these aims, recommendations for management are required and in some cases, management actions will be undertaken or led by research personnel.&nbsp; The main areas of research will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluation of the importance of predation by carpet pythons in the Waychinicup NP enclosure in regulating potoroo numbers. This aspect is largely complete, and a paper is in preparation.</li>
<li>If python predation&nbsp;is significant, evaluate methods for reducing python predation at this site, for implementation.&nbsp;This research aspect is covered by a separate SPP and is being led by Dr David Pearson with input from Albany-based SCD and FRSD staff.</li>
<li>Evaluate potential translocation sites, including Middle Island in the Recherche Archipelago and a mainland site, including resource availability and predation risk.</li>
<li>Implement a translocation to at least one of these sites.</li>
<li>Undertake a survey of the genetic variability of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo across all populations and develop a population management strategy.</li>
<li>Publication of 20 + years of research and monitoring data to ensure appropriate management into the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The expected outcome of this project will be a series of recommendations, based on published information for management of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo to achieve the greater security of the species. Ideally, management of the populations will achieve population stability and the highest genetic variability possible given the low number of animals.&nbsp; This will require a greater understanding of the current status of populations and the ecological requirements of the species at its various sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Management Implications</p>
<p>The recommendations arising from this project will include management actions necessary to increase the likelihood that this species will persist. These are expected to include continued and enhanced control of foxes and feral cats at all existing and new mainland population sites as well as fire management at all sites to protect long-unburnt habitat areas. Action to reduce predation by carpet pythons may also be recommended. Management of potoroo population genetics will involve movement of animals between the isolated population sites. Some or all of these actions will involve District and Regional staff.</p>","<p>Existing collaborations with Parks and Wildlife Albany District and South Coast Region staff are vital for the successful management and recovery of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo. This involves working closely with management staff, particularly on predator control, fire management and management of infrastructure such as the captive holding facility at Two Peoples Bay and the Waychinicup NP enclosure.</p>
<p>Collaborations with university academics and students from ECU, Murdoch University and UWA have already produced valuable information on the biology and ecology of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo and it is expected that such collaborations will continue and increase. In particular, students at the UWA Albany campus are ideally situated to be involved in such projects.</p>
<p>Funding collaboration, most importantly with South Coast NRM and local community group the Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroo Action Group (GPAG) will continue and will involve close cooperation with these groups to foster and grow support for potoroo recovery.

A remnant population of around 30 animals was found in long-unburnt shrubland and low woodland on the slopes on the Mount Gardner headland, Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve (TPBNR). A recovery team was formed in 1995 and an Interim Recovery Plan guided early recovery efforts. These included a search for further populations and the establishment of a captive breeding colony, while research to elucidate the ecology of the species progressed. A high priority was to produce more animals so that a translocation could proceed in order to create an insurance population in the wild, against the possibility of a catastrophic wildfire at TPBNR. Although breeding in captivity occurred in the first few years, this was not sustained. Wide searches along the south coast of WA produced no evidence of further populations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Recovery Plan was adopted in 2004, with an emphasis on investigation of assisted breeding techniques, including investigation of artificial insemination and cross-fostering, followed by translocation of stock produced. Although the techniques were trialed, as well as hand-rearing wild-caught pouch young, eventual success was achieved by translocation of small numbers of mainly sub-adult animals from the wild population to Bald Island, 25 km east of TPBNR. Ten animals were transferred between 2005 and 2007 and by 2011 the population had grown to over 70 animals. A 380 ha introduced predator free enclosure was built at Waychinicup NP and a release program involving animals from Bald Island and TPBNR commenced in 2010. This population has attained a maximum of 29 animals despite the release of over 40 animals - predation by carpet pythons appears to have been a factor in the lack of population growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015 a lightning storm ignited a wildfire at TPBNR which burnt over 90% of the known potoroo habitat in the reserve. Seven potoroos were rescued from the fire ground and were initially&nbsp;kept in the captive facility. To improve the survivorship of the remaining potoroos, an investigation of the suitability of Michaelmas Island, near Albany, as a translocation site was undertaken in March 2016. This indicated that the island could only support a small number of potoroos but release of two males and two females in July 2016 resulted in the death of the two females and necessitated the rescue of the males. They were released into the unburnt habitat at TPBNR and&nbsp;the population there is thought to comprise 4-5 individuals.</p>
<p>A revised Recovery Plan for Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroo was drafted in 2016 and is currently being evaluated by the Commonwealth Department of Environment and Energy. Priorities include close monitoring of existing populations and the establishment of at least one further population in the wild. An analysis of 20+ years on monitoring data that will assist the future direction of the research and management program for the Gilbert potoroo will also be undertaken, along with publication of important demographic data.</p>"
2609,"<p>The proposed research aims to identify priority social science research needs that can support delivery of DBCA business processes</p>
<p>The horizon scanning methodology is founded upon an expert elicitation technique known as the Delphi method. It comprises a structured approach to decision-making in complex contexts where documented data and information (or opportunities for gathering these) is lacking, but where expert knowledge is available. The Delphi method has been refined and applied in a diverse range of contexts. It is proposed to apply a methodology refined from the approach of Gluszek et al. 2020, which uses a remote, internet-based platform for eliciting knowledge using Qualtrics software. This is important because of the vast distances across which DBCA staff are dispersed across WA.</p>
<p>The horizon scan methodology comprises four primary stages: 1) data collection comprising a simple rapid online survey and review by Regional Managers and Nature Conservation Leaders; 2) Analysis where priority social science topics are identified and ranked; 3) Approval of the priority topics by Executive Director, BCS which includes necessary refinements prior to; 4) Completion of a small number of Science Concept Plans for consideration by the BCS Leadership team.</p>
<p>These four stages of the horizon scanning activity will be followed by a set of stages that are not science in the strict sense, but that define &lsquo;applied&rsquo; research and are designed and implemented to mainstream the outputs of the proposed project into DBCA activities. These include 1) returning the findings to staff who&rsquo;ve participated in the horizon scan through &lsquo;topic summaries to ensure that they are fully-informed about the outcomes of the horizon scan; 2) interpreting the topics as a small number of Science Concept Plans (SCP) for approval by the BCS Leadership Team, which in turn form the basis of a research plan by Dr Andrew Knight; 3) developing partnerships and funding applications to initiate projects guided by the SCPs; and finally 4) evaluating the horizon scanning methodology is evaluated and refined, so that the pros and cons of the methodology can be identified, and a decision made as to the utility of the overall approach.</p>

<p>As the inter-face between marine and terrestrial environments, wave-cut intertidal reefs are a harsh environment, and the distinctive composition of temperate intertidal reef communities reflects both the ability of organisms to tolerate a relatively wide range of physical conditions and the consequences of biological processes such as recruitment, competition and predation (Dakin &amp; Bennett 1987, Edgar 2001).</p>
<p>The pronounced vertical distribution of intertidal organisms typically relates to their capacity to tolerate relatively predictable tidal cycles of exposure, inundation and wave action. Hence, species diversity on the high intertidal is low and typically restricted to desiccation-resistant molluscs (such as <em>Austrolittorina _and _Nodilittorina),</em> while organisms of particular abundance on the rarely exposed reef crest (such as <em>Haliotis roei)</em> are more robust to the effects of high wave energy (Edgar 2001, 2008). On the broader reef platform, even small variations in height relative to the tide datum can lead to significant differences in environment conditions caused by varying degrees of tidal exposure. Hence, organisms are commonly also patchily distributed across the seemingly minor depressions, rock-pools and ridges that occur on most reef platforms (Britton et al. 1988). In addition to tidal influences, intertidal reef habitats are also subject to less predictable episodic disturbances from, for example, strong wave action, sand deposition and relatively extreme temperatures (Dayton 1971), which may result in localised or widespread mortality among intertidal organisms (Hodgkin 1959a, Leviten &amp; Kohn 1980, Kohn 1993). Such disturbances can act to maintain community heterogeneity across a range of scales (Lubchenco &amp; Menge 1978). The biological communities of shoreline platform reefs may also be influenced by terrestrial factors, such as freshwater aquifer discharge, particularly if these sources are polluted (Johannes 1980).</p>
<p>Complex biological processes such as recruitment, competition, herbivory and predation also strongly influence the structure of intertidal communities (Dayton 1971, Lubchenco &amp; Menge 1978). While larval recruitment to reef platforms may vary depending on life-cycle traits (such as direct or pelagic larval development), the availability of space and competition between organisms for space are major factors that structure intertidal reef communities. Early life stages of many organisms, for example, may require suitable settlement habitat (Raimondi 1990), while some species are competitively dominant over others (Dayton 1971). Intra-specific competition among cohorts may also affect community composition (Boventura et al. 2003). The potential dominance of competitively successful species may in turn be restricted by herbivory, predation or disturbance events.</p>
<p>Direct human interactions can also impact on intertidal reef habitats, which are often easily accessible from the shore. Such impacts may comprise the trampling of organisms by repeated access or their removal by collecting (Robinson 2005). Platform reefs support some important recreational and commercial fishery species, such as Roe’s abalone Haliotis roei while other species may be taken for bait or by shell collectors (Keough et al. 1991, Hancock &amp; Caputi 2006).</p>
<p>2. Intertidal reefs in temperate Western Australia.</p>
<p>While wave sculpted intertidal platform reefs are a feature of many temperate Australian rocky shores, their presence and structure depends on the wave exposure and the underlying geology (Dakin &amp; Bennett 1987). Hence, while such platform reefs are relative uncommon along WA’s predominantly granitic south coast, they are a common coastal feature of the ‘warm’ temperate zone extending from Shark Bay to Cape Leeuwin where coastal features are dominated by the softer Tamala limestone.</p>
<p>Mainland and island intertidal reefs of this region typically comprise a flat reef platform backed to landward side by an undercut cliff (Figure 1), while isolated patch reefs typically comprise only the reef flat. The platform width varies markedly; those at Rottnest Island commonly exceed 50 m in width and are typically wider than those on the adjacent mainland. The reef platforms vary in structure from being relatively level to very irregular due to the presence of gutters and rock-pools, and their elevation in relation to tide datum may vary considerably. The seaward platform edge is frequently raised into a distinct rim beneath which the reef falls away in a vertical or undercut face to the seabed below.</p>
<p>3. Intertidal reefs of the Marmion and Shoalwater Islands Marine Parks</p>
<p>The Marmion Marine Park (MMP) and Shoalwater Islands Marine Park (SIMP) are located on the north and south Perth metropolitan coast, respectively. Covering coastal waters between Burns Beach and Trigg Island, the ca 9,500 ha MMP was created in 1987, while the ca 6,658 ha SIMP was created in 1990 over coastal waters from South Channel to Becher Point (CALM 1992, DEC 2007). Sanctuary zones were, however, only established in the SIMP as recently as 2007. The MMP and SIMP comprise a similar geomorphology dominated by sub-tidal and emergent limestone reefs and shallow sandy embayments (Searle &amp; Semenuik 1985). Both marine parks support a diverse range of marine conservation values ranging from various marine habitats to threatened marine fauna. These marine parks are subject to high levels of recreational and commercial human activity due to their proximity to the Perth metropolitan area. Occurring along mainland and island shores and as isolated offshore patch reefs, significant areas of intertidal reef platform occur in both the MMP and SIMP.</p>
<p>Intertidal reef organisms of the Perth region have been studied since the early 1950s (Smith 1952, Marsh 1955, Hodgkin 1959b, Hodgkin et al. 1959). Since that time, most local research in this field has been concentrated at Rottnest Island, which supports large areas of intertidal reef (see Black &amp; Johnson 1983, Wells et al. 1993a, 1993b). Studies in the 1980s on the intertidal reef fauna of the Perth metropolitan mainland derived from concern regarding exploitation of H. roei and planning for the then proposed Marmion Marine Park (Wells et al. 1987). A recent re-examination of intertidal reef invertebrates at Cottesloe, Waterman and Trigg on the northern Perth metropolitan coast concluded that no major changes in these communities had occurred since the 1980s (Wells et al. 2007). This study however, examined only three mainland reef sites, of which, two (Trigg and Waterman) were located within the MMP.</p>
<p>Management of intertidal reefs in the Perth region has increased significantly in recent decades through the creation of marine parks and reserves and enhanced fishery controls (CALM 1992, Hancock &amp; Caputi 2006, DEC 2007). While the above studies provide a significant regional knowledge base, the broad spatial patterns of intertidal biodiversity across both the MMP and SIMP are not adequately understood. Particular gaps exist in knowledge of the intertidal communities of the SIMP and offshore platform reefs. This project will significantly expand on the knowledge generated by Wells et al. (1987, 2007) by increasing the number of sampling sites across both the MMP and SIMP and including offshore platform reefs. This study will determine relationships between the composition of these communities and the physical structure and location of the reefs. This study will focus on assemblages of algae, echinoderms, molluscs and barnacles, as these include major primary producers (ie algae), grazers (ie echinoderms and molluscs) and predators (ie molluscs) in these habitats. It is anticipated that this study will provide a basis for the design and implementation of comparative intertidal research in marine parks and reserves across WA.  </p>
<p><em>4. Management relevance</em></p>
<p>This study will provide knowledge of how intertidal reef communities in the MMP and SIMP are structured in space and time. Such ‘inventory’ and/or ‘baseline’ information is required to determine the composition of these ecological values in relation to natural processes, and to benchmark their condition with regard to the impact of current and future anthropogenic impacts (Simpson 2007).</p>
<p>This study will address the following management questions:</p>
<p>·         What are the patterns of intertidal biodiversity in the MMP and SIMP?</p>
<p>·         Do areas of particularly high intertidal biodiversity exist, and where are they located?</p>
<p>·         What natural and/or anthropogenic factors best explain the patterns of intertidal biodiversity in the MMP and SIMP?</p>
<p>·         Do the current sanctuary zones provide adequate and representative protection for these communities?</p>
<p>·         How should these communities be monitored?</p>","<p>This project will:</p>

To achieve this Megan Barnes will conduct two trips to the Kimberley to conduct workshops and work with managers, one in each year of the project.

<p>Efficiency and cost-effectiveness could be increased by optimising delivery of this high cost process to maximise biodiversity benefits through two key improvements: (1) characterisation of utility thresholds (i.e. the thresholds at which efficiency and impact decrease below a useful level) to inform &ldquo;how much shooting is enough&rdquo;, and (2) impact focused spatial action planning, to identify spatially explicit management strategies that balance the conservation needs of multiple species while accounting for other funds and opportunities in that timestep.</p>
<p>Structured Decision Making (SDM) is a formal collaborative process designed to facilitate decision making in multi objective, value-laden contexts characterized by limited resources, uncertainty, and difficult trade-offs such as these (Gregory 2012). Challenges in the Kimberly that met these criteria were collaboratively identified with Kimberley region staff. Emerging from this process domains of management that would benefit from the application of structured decision making were identified. Three of these key challenges are 1) optimising herbivore management to minimise cost while ensuring the program continues to meet biodiversity goals, 2) understanding and characterising synergies and trade-offs, and identifying thresholds to change management (e.g. the most cost-effective strategy may have poor outcomes for particular sites or assets), and 3) understanding the utility of monitoring in this context.</p>"

<li>Introduced predators, particularly feral cats are the major threat to the conservation of many native species, particularly mammals and ground birds.</li>
<li>Effective feral cat control is key to the conservation of many species.</li>
<li>Eradicat baits, although shown to be effective in some areas, have not yet been effective at substantially reducing cat numbers in the southern jarrah forest, due to high non-target bait interference (Wayne et al in review). Cats are also likely less likely to take baits while there their preferred live prey is readily available. It is therefore unlikely that Eradicat baits alone will significant reduce cat densities in high conservation value areas such as the Upper Warren, which supports critically important populations of several priority species such as the <em>Critically Endangered</em> woylie, and western ringtail possum, <em>Endangered</em> numbat and <em>Vulnerable</em> chuditch (Wayne et al in review).</li>

<p>The &lsquo;Felixer&rsquo; cat grooming trap is a novel method of controlling feral cats that takes advantage of their compulsive grooming behaviour.&nbsp; The trap consists of an auditory lure to attract cats and a series of infra-red sensors, which when triggered are analysed using a series of algorithms to identify if the animal is a target (fox and cat), or non-target species.&nbsp; When a target is identified the trap shoots a sticky gel that contains 1080 poison onto the animal&rsquo;s fur. &nbsp;The fox or cat will then groom this gel from their fur and in doing so will ingest the poison and die. These devises can be highly effective in removing feral cats. For example, Felixer traps removed about 33 or 60% of feral cats &nbsp;during a 6-week deployment in a 2,600 ha area (e.g. Moseby et al. 2020).</p>
<p>Statistical and design modelling shows that 4-8 Felixer grooming traps can remove &gt;80% feral cats from a 15,000 ha area in 4-8 week period (Brian Chambers, unpublished data).

Historically, it had a diverse fauna and rich flora (over 250 species recorded, including several local endemics). Sheep and goat pastoralism degraded the island&rsquo;s vegetation and eight invasive weed species are present on the island. Invasive alien fauna, notably cats, decimated the native mammal fauna. <br /><br />DHI is located within the traditional lands of the Malgana Aboriginal People and the Shark Bay World Heritage Area. It was gazetted as a National Park in 2009. Funding for a 20-year ecological restoration initiative through the Net Conservation Benefits Fund (NCBF) in 2008 allowed restoration of the island&rsquo;s vegetation communities and mammal and avian fauna. Thousands of sheep and goats were eradicated by 2017. Cat eradication began intensively in 2012 with DHI declared cat-free in October 2018. These activities prepared the island for fauna reintroductions which began in 2017 with translocation of two hare-wallaby species, with 11 more species planned for reintroduction over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>A community engagement project has comprised one element of the ecological restoration project. Its primary objective is to communicate the project to stakeholder groups and gain community understanding and support for the project. Stakeholders include neighbouring landholders on Dirk Hartog Island, Shire of Shark Bay, Shark Bay Community, all DHI visitors including DHI Lodge visitors and national park visitors, key contributors including NCBF, volunteers, special interest groups including Birdlife Australia, the tourism community, as well as WA visitors to Shark Bay.</p>
<p>Community engagement activities have included: signage on the island and the nearby mainland, biosecurity signage at Edel Land, , information on the DBCA Explore Parks and the Sharkbay.org website, ongoing biannual newsletter (Wirruwana News), ongoing updates in the town&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inscription Post&rdquo; four times annually, social media via DBCA Facebook page including all Denham groups, a permanent interpretive display at Monkey Mia, community artwork projects, children&rsquo;s activities in local schools and school holiday activity programs, DHI visitor and biosecurity brochures, stalls at key events including the Bush Heritage Science Fair, Denham markets, and biosecurity welcome packs for island visitors,</p>

According to subfossil records, the species was once widely distributed across the heathlands of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. It now occurs in species-rich and structurally complex heathland and woodland in two disjunct areas in south-western Victoria/eastern South Australia and in southern Western Australia (WA). The main ecological difference between these two separate meta-populations appears to be related to fire regime. In WA, the species is known from long unburnt habitat with highest densities recorded in vegetation 30 years post-fire. Whereas in Victoria, highest densities have been recorded in habitat 5-15 years after fire. While there is disparity in two studies investigating their genetic differentiation, they are currently treated as a single species.</p>
<p>Originally collected in 1906 near Pingelly in WA&rsquo;s wheatbelt, the heath mouse was thought to be extinct in WA until its rediscovery in 1987. Since then, it has been detected in low numbers within the Fitzgerald River National Park, Dragon Rocks Nature Reserve, Ravensthorpe Range (and nearby) and Lake Magenta Nature Reserve. Until 2019, the last confirmed record of the heath mouse in WA was in 2004, from Lake Magenta. The heath mouse is listed as Endangered under the <em>EPBC</em> Act and Vulnerable under the WA <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act.</em></p>
<p>The lack of recent heath mouse records in WA instigated targeted surveys for this species in May/June 2019, which resulted in their capture at two locations: one south of Ravensthorpe (Unallocated Crown Land Block 1040) and the second in the Great Western Woodlands 80km southeast of Hyden near Diggers Rock. This preliminary survey provided evidence that the heath mouse was still extant in WA, but further surveys in 2020 failed to detect the species despite sampling in areas where they had previously been recorded (i.e., Lake Magenta Nature Reserve, Fitzgerald River National Park and the Ravensthorpe Range area). In general, trap success across all sights was remarkably low, and was thought to be due to successive years of below average rainfall across the area.</p>
<p>Although not previously thought to be a boom/bust species, studies in the Grampians National Park in Victoria have shown a strong correlation between heath mouse abundance and rainfall. Abundance peaked following high rainfall events and fell to very low densities during drought conditions. This is also likely to be the case in WA, although the lack of long-term monitoring data makes this difficult to discern.</p>
<p>As there is no recovery plan for the heath mouse, and yet there is evidence of a significant decline in their distribution and abundance, further targeted survey is critical to determine their current conservation status. Given the low density and patchy distribution of the heath mouse, developing a survey strategy that maximises the likelihood of detecting the species poses a challenge. Habitat suitability models based on historical records and relevant environmental data layers can assist, but given the species appears to be now absent in many of the areas where it was historically recorded, the reliability of such static models is questionable. As annual rainfall has declined in south-west WA, and is predicted to decline further, projecting these models onto future climate scenarios may be useful for selecting survey locations in areas previously thought to be unsuitable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Should populations of the heath mouse be detected, a decision then needs to be made in terms of what management actions are required to protect the species and promote its recovery. In-situ actions alone may not be adequate if their abundance is determined to be critically low. In this case, establishing a captive breeding program may be an option, with the goal to produce enough founders for reintroductions.</p>

<p>Improving ecological knowledge of seagrasses and the communities they support has been identified as a high research priority for management of most of WA's marine parks, especially with regard to the emerging pressures associated with marine heatwave events and climate change (Kendrick et al. 2016).</p>","[[""Role"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Scientist"",""1.5"",""1.4"",""1.3""],[""Technical"",""0"",""0.05"",""0.05""],[""Volunteer"",""0.05"",""0.05"",""0.05""],[""Collaborator"",""0.15"",""0.15"",""0.15""]]","[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Consolidated Funds (DBCA)"",""8200"",""9980"",""6980""],[""External Funding"","""","""",""""]]",,,"<p>Seagrasses are foundation species that provide important ecosystem services and support key ecological processes in the marine environment (Ellison et al. 2005; Orth et al. 2006; Nordlund et al. 2017). Seagrass meadows for example provide food and habitat for threatened fauna like syngnathids, support fisheries, provide detritus and nutrient subsidies to adjacent systems, accrete and stabilize sediment, thereby maintaining water quality and storing organic carbon (York et al. 2018; Unsworth, Nordlund, and Cullen-Unsworth 2018). Unfortunately, due to their typical location in shallow coastal waters, seagrasses are frequently exposed to pressures such as terrestrial run-off, anchor damage, eutrophication and dredging; all listed as contributing factors towards a gradual global decline of 7% yr<sup>-1</sup> (Waycott et al. 2009). Another key pressure globally and across WA is climate change; steadily increasing sea water temperature and frequency of extreme heating events (e.g. heat waves) have already caused a significant decline in seagrass cover in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area (Nowicki et al. 2017). As seagrass communities are of high conservation significance and their condition often responds rapidly to such pressures, they are used as key performance indicators of management effectiveness for most WA marine reserves. With seagrass indicators showing declining condition across multiple marine reserves, it is imperative that we understand the consequences of these changes for associated fauna, particularly those of high conservation, ecological or commercial value. Indeed, a loss of foundation species may lead to major bottom-up impacts that have the potential to spread through ecosystems (Ellison et al. 2005; Shelton 2010).</p>"
1304,"<p>Although little is known about population size, distribution and residency patterns, it is well accepted that Australian snubfin (<em>Orcaella</em> <em>heinsohni</em>) and Australian humpback dolphin (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) inhabit Australia's tropical north-western coastal waters (Allen_, et al.<em> 2012). Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins occur across Australia's entire northwest coast including resident populations at Ningaloo Marine Park and most likely the Dampier Archipelago as well as further north into the Kimberley. The snubfin dolphin is endemic to northern Australia with identified resident populations in the Kimberley, Northern Territory and Queensland (Brown</em>, et al.<em> 2014; Brown</em>, et al.<em> 2014). While this species has been sighted occasionally in the Pilbara, their presence and use of this area is yet to be determined, however the Pilbara is likely to represent the southern extreme of their range (Allen</em>, et al._ 2012).</p>
<p>Limited surveys have been conducted targeting coastal dolphins in the Pilbara; exceptions include a dedicated study of humpback dolphins in Ningaloo Marine Park and Exmouth Gulf (Brown_, et al.<em> 2012) and opportunistic surveys and anecdotal sightings throughout the region (Allen</em>, et al._ 2012). Aerial surveys that were targeting humpback whales sighted dolphins but were unable to differentiate between species due to the high altitude flown (1000 ft) (Jenner &amp; Jenner 2004; Jenner &amp; Jenner 2010). Although the presence of several coastal dolphin species is expected in nearshore waters (humpback, snubfin and bottlenose dolphins) (Hanf 2014) the residency, degree of use and habitat characteristics of these species are unknown in the Pilbara.</p>
<p>Human pressures and impacts on these species are increasing, in particular in the Pilbara through activities associated with the rapid expansion of resources sector, including oil and gas exploration and production, coastal infrastructure development and shipping. This is often a key factor that proponents are required to address to secure environmental approvals at the State and Commonwealth levels. However, as noted above, the knowledge base on these species across their range is very poor. In addition, there are no agreed best practice protocols or standards for survey design and data collection on these species that allow for comparison to be made between studies and study sites. A better understanding of these species and their use of tPilbara coastal waters is needed to provide good temporal and regional context for assessing and managing impacts and to reduce uncertainty in the approvals process. As such, the draft_ Strategic Research Priorities for Marine Mammal Conservation and Management in Western Australia 2014_ recognised both snubfin and humpback dolphins as high priority species for fundamental research</p>","<p>This research will enable a better understanding of coastal dolphin species at a regional and national scale including distribution, abundance, habitat use, movement and connectivity. The main outcomes and benefits will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distribution and abundance including high density areas and spatial and temporal patterns of coastal dolphins will be identified and mapped across the Pilbara to allow managers to assess conflicts with potential pressures;</li>
<li>Key habitat will be identified which can be used to assess potential overlap with pressures such as habitat loss from coastal development and displacement from industrial development leading to better informed decision making during Environmental Impact Assessment processes;</li>
<li>Populations will be defined for coastal dolphin species (humpback, bottlenose and snubfin, where applicable) which will allow managers to assess the relative conservation significance of different populations or species in relation to pressures or factors like restricted distributions;</li>
<li>Baseline data will inform ongoing regional monitoring and management and for comparison with other regions;</li>
<li>A state-wide database will be implemented modelled on the Northern Territory database 'DolFIN' to archive and manage survey and photo-Identification data which will improve information management, compatibility and information sharing between jurisdictions</li>
<li>Data on population abundance and distribution of humpback and snubfin dolphins in the Pilbara will allow a more comprehensive assessment of their conservation status at a State and National level.</li>

Both the Science Plan and this specific project have been discussed with and circulated to regional Parks and Wildlife staff responsible for offset programs and marine conservation and management (including Pilbara Regional Manager (Alisdair MacDonald), Exmouth District Manager (Arvid Hogstrom), Pilbara Marine Program Coordinator (Rachael Marshall), Ningaloo Marine Park Coordinator (Peter Barnes) and Reserves Officer (Carolyn Williams). These discussions have included opportunities to collaborate with the Region and other offset programs in shared field work and in field logistics. Further discussions will be undertaken with these regional staff in Exmouth and Karratha in both the planning phase and when data is available. In particular their advice and participation in liaising with Indigenous rangers (where appropriate in the Pilbara), gathering local knowledge and planning logistics will be valuable.

While marine productivity is largely attributable to oceanic phytoplankton (Sigman &amp; Hain 2012), productivity from benthic macrophytes becomes increasingly important in coastal food webs (Wyatt et al. 2010, Davis et al. 2014). However, the link between benthic productivity by vascular plants and algae and secondary production remains equivocal (Saenger et al. 2013).

<p>The Abrolhos islands are a popular recreation site, currently free of introduced predators, and host the only WA population of the Abrolhos painted button quail (Turnix varius scintillans), several important seabird breeding areas, and sea lion breeding areas that may be negatively impacted by disturbance, among other biodiversity values.</p>
<p>Abrolhos painted button quails (APBQ) were recently identified as at high risk of extinction. The APBQ is resident on East and West Wallabi Islands (a single connected population), now likely to be the&nbsp;only remaining population of APBQs, as a result of the extirpation of a population on North Island where they were once common.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Houtman-Abrolhos Islands National Park (HAINP) was declared on 25th July 2019. HAINP was declared for its biodiversity, heritage and landscape values and to create opportunities for visitors to enjoy their unrivalled beauty. Managing HAINP requires a base of operations which is planned on East Wallabi Island. Significant investment to implement tourism infrastructure including a new jetty on East Wallabi Island has been assigned.</p>
<p>Some natural values have already experienced declines on East Wallabi, and increased use may result in increased invasion risk by feral species such as rats. But how likely invasion will be is unclear, and there are also potential benefits, including increased opportunities to detect any invasion should it occur. In response to the HAINP declaration, given the likely increase in visitation and use identified in the draft management plan, and concern about the implications of the arrival of invasive mammals, a risk assessment was considered desirable. A pilot workshop was conducted at which a risk assessment was identified as a key need for APBQ.&nbsp;</p>

However, the principal objectives of these reserves are complicated by a changing environment/climate, where marine habitats and species distributions are unlikely to remain static. Marine finfish are a mobile component of marine biodiversity, which are of ecological and social importance. Accordingly, a long-term monitoring program was established by DBCA in 2009 to collect information on the condition of finfish with respect to natural and anthropogenic pressures. Data from the monitoring program also provides an opportunity for understanding how fish assemblages differ among marine reserves, but not how they differ to locations outside of reserves. Moreover, environmental changes are leading to shifts in the composition of fish assemblages, and it is unclear how well the current network of reserves represents fish diversity across the state. The proposed project will combine DBCA monitoring data with information from external collaborators to assess fish biodiversity both inside and outside W.A. marine parks. This will include new information on fishes from the Kimberley marine parks, collected using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). This method is being used increasingly to monitor fish assemblages in locations that divers cannot access, however, further research is needed to understand how data collected by ROV compares to that of the current methods used to monitor fish assemblages. To achieve these goals, data will be uploaded to GlobalArchive, a&nbsp;centralised&nbsp;repository that allows users to store data in a standardised and secure manner, makes meta-data discoverable, and encourages collaboration and synthesis of datasets&nbsp;within the community of practice.

2874,"<p>This project aims to evaluate and apply novel spatio-temporal landscape genetic methods to identify refugia and dispersal corridors that build evolutionary resilience for mammal fauna, essential for best-practice conservation under global change.

Globally, the conservation community is recognising that a static, fragmented protected area system is, in many cases, inadequate to conserve populations and species in large areas, over long time-scales and given current rates of environmental change [1,2]. This recognition has motivated a paradigm shift in conservation thinking away from managing species at a local scale to a broader spatial and temporal perspective: managing species and ecological processes at a whole-of-landscape scale [3] and incorporating evolutionary processes to build species&rsquo; capacity for adaptation to environmental change [4].</p>
<p>There are two key foci in this species&rsquo; resilience conservation approach: (i) protecting refugia, areas of the landscape that offer temporally stable, climatically buffered habitat that species can retreat to, persist in and expand from under changing environmental conditions, and which represent potential reservoirs of genetic diversity for adaptation to change [5&ndash;8]; and (ii) promoting population connectivity to maintain metapopulation viability and to retain species&rsquo; evolutionary potential [4,9].</p>
<p>Frameworks exist for the identification of refugia [7] and their incorporation into conservation planning including Australian examples [10,11]. Efforts to characterise landscape connectivity, however, are frequently hampered by the lack of empirical data on species dispersal with which to inform mechanistic models [12]. Emerging landscape genetics approaches that quantify gene flow as a proxy for realised dispersal to assess landscape connectivity hold promise to infer dispersal corridors, but to date there has been little uptake in conservation planning, both here and internationally [13]. Single-species case studies are available [14,15], however, to be useful as a landscape-scale conservation prioritisation tool, connectivity expectations across a range of species with different movement characteristics and/or habitat requirements is required for robust conservation decision-making [14].</p>
<p>Characterisation of the major modes of dispersal for different species types (guilds) and the landscape features that modify or promote connectivity is critical information for landscape-scale conservation planning. Further, in much the same way that the spatio-temporal stability of refugia are assessed, the stability of species&rsquo; dispersal corridors should be evaluated under past, present and predicted future environmental conditions to inform crucial dispersal routes. Application of a spatio-temporal landscape genetics approach to multi-species conservation planning therefore represents a novel and significant advancement in this field, both nationally and internationally, and provides a means to move beyond a simple pattern- to process-based approach to species conservation [1,4,13].</p>
<p>The Pilbara biogeographic region in arid north-west Western Australia (WA) is one of the oldest landscapes on earth [16] and provides an excellent case study with which to demonstrate the application of this innovative approach. The Pilbara has a unique and incredibly rich biodiversity [16], and due to its vast mineral reserves, is also a critical source of income for the Australian economy, contributing 80% of WA&rsquo;s $103 billion mineral and petroleum industry [17]. The rapid pace of resource development in the Pilbara has generated conflict between the State&rsquo;s desire to support economic development whilst also upholding its responsibilities to protect biodiversity and environmental values as required by Federal (Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act) and State legislation. The WA Government&rsquo;s recently released Pilbara Conservation Strategy identifies that a landscape-scale, coordinated approach to development and biodiversity conservation is critical to ensure sustainable outcomes for government, industry and the environment. This project is therefore significant in bringing together key government and industry stakeholders actively engaged in conservation management in the Pilbara bioregion to identify priority conservation management areas for the small-medium sized mammal fauna, including four EPBC-listed threatened species (northern quoll, bilby, ghost bat, Pilbara leaf-nosed bat). These &lsquo;critical weight range&rsquo; mammals are recognised as being the most &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; to human-associated disturbances [18].</p>

A long history of fauna extinctions on mainland Australia means that conservation of our threatened mammals requires effective management of different types of &ldquo;islands&rdquo; &ndash; continental islands isolated for at least 8,000 years by rising sea levels, mainland remnants resulting from range collapse over the past century, and increasingly, recent translocates into predator-controlled environments (either fenced exclosures or pest-free islands). Populations subject to single or repeated reductions in size will rapidly lose genetic diversity. More insidiously, island populations, held at small sizes for thousands of generations, accumulate deleterious mutations &ndash; genetic load &ndash; because selection against these is overwhelmed by drift. This erosion of genetic diversity and accumulation of genetic load reduces the adaptability and viability of populations, hampering their long-term survival. The extent to which genetic load increases in small, recently translocated populations is relatively unknown. Comparing populations with different histories of isolation and size reduction will broaden our understanding of how genetic load accumulates, and whether this impacts on translocation success.</p>
<p>This project focuses on seven species (rufous hare-wallaby, boodie, woylie, dibbler, golden bandicoot, black-flanked rock wallaby, tammar wallaby) with extensive and well-documented histories of conservation translocations and where there is potential for mixing populations to reduce genetic load in ongoing management. These species have a history of range collapse but have multiple fragmented remnant populations where information on current/historical divergence will be critical to management decisions. These species have had multiple previous or ongoing translocations with documentation of translocation history and monitoring of translocation outcomes. We will assess (i) whether outcomes of past translocations can be predicted by genetic diversity or load of source and translocated populations, and ii) for mixed populations, whether genomic/phenotypic divergence among sources has positive or negative outcomes.</p>"

1771,"<p>Dirk Hartog Island (DHI) is Western Australia's largest island (62,000 ha) and is located in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area. Historically the island is significant as the site of the first European landing on Australia's west coast. Between 1869 and 2009, DHI was a pastoral lease running up to 20,000 sheep at a time; during this time cats were introduced and became feral.&nbsp; Goats were introduced during the construction of the light house in 1908 and readily established on the island. In 2009 most of DHI became a national park managed by the Department of Parks and Wildlife (some freehold was retained by the former pastoral lessee). Because of its former&nbsp;diverse mammal fauna, the island has long been considered a suitable site for an ecological restoration project, and funding provided by the Net Conservation Benefits associated with the Gorgon Gas Project on Barrow Island allowed this to proceed. In 2011 a program to eradicate or remove all the sheep, feral goats and feral cats was commenced. This has progressed well and is anticipated to be completed in 2017/18.</p>
<p>A major &nbsp;component of the ecological restoration project is the reconstruction of the vertebrate fauna that once occurred on DHI. Historically, 13 native terrestrial mammal species occurred on the island, however all but three species have become locally extinct.&nbsp; This 12 year project proposes to reintroduce ten species of mammal: the boodie (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>), western barred bandicoot (<em>Perameles bougainville</em>), woylie (<em>Bettongia penicillata</em>), mulgara (<em>Dasycercus blythi</em>), dibbler (<em>Parantechinus apicalis</em>), Shark Bay mouse (<em>Pseudomys fieldi</em>), greater stick-nest rat (<em>Leporillus conditor</em>), desert mouse (<em>Pseudomys desertor</em>), heath mouse (<em>Pseudomys shortridgei</em>) and chuditch (<em>Dasyurus geoffroii</em>). In addition the threatened rufous hare-wallaby (<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>) and banded hare-wallaby (<em>Lagostrophus fasciatus</em>) will be introduced to DHI to help improve their conservation status.&nbsp; The water rat (<em>Hydromys chrysogaster</em>) and the thick-billed grass-wren may also be reintroduced.</p>

<ul>
<li>To assess and monitor source populations, both genetically and quantitatively, of the species proposed for translocation, and determine optimum founder source and number than can be removed without adversely impacting source populations.</li>
<li>To undertake translocations of the selected species and monitor their success.</li>
<li>To reconstruct the terrestrial mammal fauna, restore ecological function to DHI, and improve the conservation status of the translocated threatened species.</li>
</ul>","<p>To re-establish the terrestrial mammal fauna assemblage of Dirk Hartog Island to pre-European discovery at 1616, and to restore the ecological processes of the island.&nbsp; In doing so, conserve and increase the conservation status of several threatened and priority native mammal species and enhance the intrinsic value of Dirk Hartog Island.</p>","<p>Murdoch University: Dr Peter Spencer</p>

Consultants working on behalf of resource companies have struggled to find POPs and have not developed effective ways to monitor the impacts of mining activity on the species. POPs occur in several national parks and conservation reserves managed by the Department. It is WA's largest snake and a species popular with the wider public and Pilbara residents in particular. It is a listed ""Vulnerable"" species under the EPBC Act and ""Threatened"" under WA legislation.

<ul>
<li>Address knowledge gaps to inform the effective conservation of threatened fauna species.</li>
<li>Provide scientific knowledge to ensure the effective and efficient monitoring of fauna species.</li>
<li>Identify, assess and apply emerging technologies and innovative approaches to fauna conservation research.</li>
<li>Engage with the community to identify opportunities for involvement in fauna conservation research and to encourage knowledge transfer.</li>
<li>Build capacity to deliver fauna conservation outcomes by collaborating with other science providers, government agencies, industry and NGOs.</li>

<ol>
<li>Review of published and unpublished literature</li>

<p>A POP workshop was held in Perth in 2013 and identified the following research requirements:</p>
<p>1. Undertake a literature review; 2a. Develop survey techniques; 2b. Develop monitoring techniques: 2c. Better understand habitat requirements: 2d. Better understand breeding biology; 3a. Better understand prey relationships; 3b. Better understand predator relationships.</p>
<p>The proposed project examines the most critical of the research priorities identifed by these three documents, focusing on reviewing available literature, developing and testing survey/monitoring techniques, resolving population relationships and structure via genetic techniques, identifying conservation threats and undertaking detailed ecological work to understand habitat requirements, diet and reproduction. Note that the project has a five year life on account of the apparent low reproductive frequency of female POPs to enable determination of factors associated with this.

The threatened Pilbara Olive Python (<em>Liasis olivacea barroni</em>) has all these characteristics. It occurs in rocky ranges in the Pilbara region, including many mining areas. Attempts to monitor mining impacts on the species have been based on a limited understanding of its biology and the use of techniques that are unlikely to be sensitive to population changes. Road driving counts, remote cameras and eDNA sampling from water bodies have either not detected Pilbara Olive Pythons, or find few individuals on each sampling occasion.&nbsp; The use of a few mammal prey items as a 'surrogates' for monitoring Pilbara Olive Pythons is unlikely to be informative, because the diet is diverse and as a gape-limited predator, young pythons consume different and smaller prey than adults.</p>
<p>The Pilbara Olive Python is listed as Vulnerable under the EPBC Act 1999 and ""Threatened"" under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Conservation Notice 2014 (WA). Little information is available on its ecology, population structure/trends and conservation threats.&nbsp;Potential threats include: habitat destruction or alteration by infrastructure or mining projects; habitat degradation due to cattle and frequent fires; possible predation of young by feral animals; and the loss of important food species. Information is available on the distribution of Pilbara Olive Pythons (Smith 1981, Pearson 1993) and some ecological work has been undertaken (Pearson 2003, 2007; Tutt&nbsp; 2002, 2004).</p>
<p>The rapid expansion of resources projects in the Pilbara has resulted in numerous referrals under the EPBC Act concerning the presence or probable presence of Pilbara Olive Pythons on mining leases. Better survey and monitoring techniques are required to assess and mitigate the impact of mining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project seeks to determine&nbsp;critical aspects of the life history and population dynamics that can be incorporated in monitoring protocols. For instance, female pythons are ""capital breeders"". They breed infrequently, relying on depositing substantial fat reserves to produce and incubate eggs. Loss of preferred prey items can potentially delay or halt reproduction.</p>
<p>The collection of baseline information on life history parameters such as diet, reproductive patterns, recruitment and the survival of different cohorts will enable more sensitive monitoring of the species. Radio-telemetry will provide behavioural data on&nbsp;adult and large sub-adult pythons (transmitters can last up to 3 years and be replaced) to aid the development of survey techniques reliant on searching, while experiments with models and cameras will be used to study the probable predators of juvenile pythons. A review of the use of eDNA as a monitoring technique will also be conducted.</p>"
3332,"<p>The project has multiple aims:</p>
<ul>

<li>Evaluate the ability of individual monitoring programs to detect temporal changes and suggest improvements to the design or approach of required</li>
<li>Explore a range of approaches for interpreting monitoring data and implement them to suit individual monitoring programs</li>
<li>Explore future advances in monitoring techniques and analyses to ensure that both are incorporated as required into the department&rsquo;s monitoring to maintain its rigour and efficiency</li>
<li>Explore how effectively monitoring programs inform management and suggest improvements if required</li>
</ul>","<p>The expected outcome of the project is that it will significantly increase the ability of the department to conserve biodiversity. It will achieve this by increasing the efficiency of individual monitoring programs leading to time savings for personnel and financial savings. One benefit of the increased efficiency is that personnel will be able to potentially increase the replication in the monitoring program leading to increase rigour through an improved ability to detect changes, which will lead to better management practices to ameliorate threats. Another benefit is that it may free up personnel to engage in other monitoring or management activities, which would potentially lead to additional conservation benefits. Another outcome from this project is an improvement in the interpretation of monitoring results, which will increase the ability of the department to identify temporal changes due to threats and, consequently implement management actions to ameliorate those threats. A further expected outcome is an enhanced ability of the department to incorporate advanced in monitoring technology, methodology and analysis into current and future monitoring programs. Incorporation if these advances will improve the efficiency of monitoring programs with consequent biodiversity conservation benefits. Lastly, the project aims to ensure monitoring programs more effectively inform management leading to more focused monitoring programs that directly inform management and have clear trigger for the implementation of management actions.</p>",<p>This project will require extensive collaboration between various sections of the department but it is not envisaged that there will be collaboration with organisations outside the department.</p>,"<p>This project will address many of the strategies outlines in the department&rsquo;s Strategies Directions 2022-25 and the Science Strategic Plan 2018-21. This project will contribute towards the following 5 strategies from the department&rsquo;s Strategic Directions: (1) Conserve, restore and manage plants and animals, ecosystems and landscapes using world-recognised science and best practice management; (2) Manage threats to maintain and enhance biodiversity and cultural values; (3) Use world-recognised science to build and share biodiversity knowledge to support evidence-based management; (4) Collate, manage and share data to support effective decision making and conservation; and (5) Develop adaptive management tools to promote ecosystem resilience to the impacts of climate change and other threats. The project will also contribute towards the following 9 strategies from the Science Strategic Plan: (1) Assess conservation status of species and ecological communities; (2) Provide scientific basis for monitoring of threatened species and ecological communities; (3) Assess threats of invasive species and pathogens; (4) Improve effectiveness of monitoring and management of invasive species and pathogens; (5) Understand the pressures and threats acting on ecosystems, including altered fire and hydrological regimes, fragmentation, recreational activities, commercial operations, pollution, habitat loss, and grazing pressure; (6) Undertake research and monitoring to advance knowledge on the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to climate change; (7) Undertake research and monitoring to address gaps in biodiversity knowledge and support decision-making; (8) Identify and realise opportunities for adoption of technical advances and innovative approaches for conservation; and (9) Understand effects of variation in fire regimes on species, ecosystems and landscapes.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing these strategic aims of the department, this project will also have significant management implications for the department. As described previously, by improving the rigour, power and efficiency of the department's monitoring, it will enable the department to invest in management that maximises conservation benefits. Ensuring that monitoring programs directly and effectively inform management will enable better evaluation of the value of management practices for biodiversity conservation, which will results in improved management and conservation outcomes.</p>","[[""Role"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Scientist"",""0.8FTE"",""0.8FTE"",""0.8FTE""],[""Technical"","""","""",""""],[""Volunteer"","""","""",""""],[""Collaborator"","""","""",""""]]","[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Consolidated Funds (DBCA)"","""",""2500"",""4000""],[""External Funding"","""","""",""""]]",,,"<p>The department undertakes biodiversity monitoring to better understand biodiversity responses to environmental threats and responses to management practices designed to ameliorate those threats. However, designing monitoring programs that can effectively detect temporal responses to threats or management separately from natural temporal changes in biodiversity is challenging. This is especially pertinent for arid zone ecosystems where natural annual fluctuations due to rainfall can potentially be orders of magnitude greater than the changes due to threats or management. Furthermore, monitoring fauna, whose mobility can result in many false negatives during monitoring, only adds to the challenge of identifying temporal responses to threats or management. Given these challenges, it is important that the department evaluates the rigour of its monitoring program to assess its ability to detect temporal responses to threats and management practices.</p>
<p>This evaluation will improve the efficiency of the department&rsquo;s monitoring activities in several ways. Firstly, it will look for duplication and overlap between individual programs and see how they can be combined to provide greater rigour. Secondly, it will evaluate the ability of individual programs to detect a change due to the threat or management practices examined to see whether the rigour of the program can be improved or whether a different approach is required to detect changes. Thirdly, we will explore a multitude of new and existing approaches to interpreting temporal monitoring data to assess the value of each approach for specific monitoring programs with the aim of increasing the power of individual monitoring programs to detect the changes they were designed to detect. Lastly, we will assess how effectively monitoring program inform management and whether links to management within an adaptive management framework can be improved.</p>"

Collaborations are expected with universities including through student supervision.</p>","<p>The State Government announced in September 2021 that from 2024, forest management activities would focus on conservation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the End of Term Review (ETR) of the Forest Management Plan (FMP) 2014-2023, considerations for the next FMP (2024-2033) were that&nbsp;the Department will seek to continue to investigate the response of forest vegetation cover to climate change events, including drought and heatwaves, and to further investigate, with external agencies and research institutions, the ecological impacts of forest thinning.</p>
<p>The project aligns with KPI&rsquo;s from the ETR of the current FMP. Furthermore, it aligns with the Science Strategic Plan (2022- 2025); Strategy: <em>Develop adaptive management tools to promote ecosystem resilience to the impacts of climate change and other threats. </em>The project will contribute to this Strategy by understanding the responses of forest ecosystems to climate change to inform management. Forest thinning is also a prominent management tool proposed under the 2024-2033 Forest Management Plan.</p>","[[""Role"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Scientist"",""1.2"",""1.2"",""1.2""],[""Technical"",""0.55"",""0.55"",""0.55""],[""Volunteer"","""","""",""""],[""Collaborator"","""","""",""""]]","[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Consolidated Funds (DBCA) reallocated from existing forest projects"",""29"",""4"",""4""],[""External Funding"",""188"",""133"",""0""]]",,,"<p>A warming and drying climate in southwestern Australia has, and increasingly will, put forest ecosystems under chronic and acute moisture and temperature stress. A decline in rainfall since the 1970s and increased frequency of heatwaves have resulted in declining groundwater levels, reduced streamflow, and less plant-available water.&nbsp;Concurrently, past management of the forest for timber production have produced legacies of altered stand structure. Portions of the forests are currently characterised by dense stands of regrowth, which may be increasingly vulnerable to warming and drying because they use more water than a more mature forest. There may also be flow-on consequences of these changes in water availability and use for the biodiversity that the forest sustains, including for riparian ecosystems and habitats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project expands on SPP 2000-003 (Hydrological response to timber harvesting and associated stand management in the intermediate rainfall zone of the northern jarrah forest) and SPP 2011-20 (Long-term stand dynamics of regrowth forest in relation to site productivity and climate), both of which will be closed. SPP 2000-003 provided an important, long-term record of the groundwater and stream flow responses of the jarrah forest (via the Yarragil catchments) to a drying climate and forest thinning. Hydrological responses to a recent thinning, in 2019, will continue to be monitored by this new project.&nbsp; Knowledge gaps remain regarding the coupling of the forest to groundwater and the unsaturated zone and there remains a need to develop ecohydrological models to support decision making regarding forest management for biodiversity and forest resilience outcomes. SPP 2011-20 demonstrated the effects of forest thinning on growth and inter tree competition in regrowth stands of jarrah and karri, and produced important information on thinning activities in relation to <em>Armillaria</em> root disease and organic matter build up. However, that project had a timber resource focus so did not address many of the ecological questions that we now need answered about forest health, fuel loads, fauna habitat and biodiversity responses. This new project will build on the outcomes of these previous projects and will help fill knowledge gaps regarding forest conservation and management under the challenges of ongoing and predicted climate change, as outlined in the FMP 2024-2033.</p>
<p>One of the main intervention techniques to help the forest adjust to a drying and warming climate is to alter forest stand structure via thinning to reduce competition for water. A range of thinning trials were established as part of harvesting for timber production in southwestern Australia in the past 50 years. These show that thinning can increase available water, increase protection of riparian zones and other habitats, and increase growth rates of remaining trees.&nbsp;However, the ecological implications of thinning for conservation outcomes are less well known.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand how thinning may assist in increasing the resilience of south-west forests to a drying and warming climate, this project will investigate three main components: 1) climate drivers and forest health: that is, how forest responds to climate variability under differing management treatments; 2) hydrology: how forest structure and health influence and in turn are influenced by the storage of water in the vadose and groundwater zones and how this in turn influences streamflow and evapotranspiration; and 3) thinning: can changing stem number (functional sapwood, basal area) increase resilience, and what are the ecological responses to thinning. In addition, the forest, with and without thinning, will experience disturbance interactions such as fire, pests, pathogens, and thus these will also be investigated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous social research suggests that in some areas thinning may not be palatable to the wider community. This requires further work to understand attitudes and perceptions to thinning and forest management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The key issues identified were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insufficient individuals captured in any single trapping session to enable an effective estimate of population abundance or density (relative or absolute) using mark-recapture analyses.</li>
<li>An inability to accurately assess local population trends due to large variability in sampling efficiency. This has limited the usefulness of descriptive statistical approaches to determine if the variability between trapping events at sites is due to sampling inconsistencies or true changes in population abundance/densities.</li>
</ol>
<p>In response, the Chuditch Recovery Team requested a review to determine the limitations of the current data, and what data would be required to amend these issues. It became apparent that, at the state-level, the relative abundance of chuditch had declined significantly in the last five years (2013-17). However, the analyses conducted were not designed to identify causal processes. Additionally, the information currently collected from Western Shield only provides information on population trends along road transects within Western Shield managed areas, thereby limiting our understanding of what is happening at a wider population level.</p>
<p>An investigation examining chuditch populations across the broader landscape, which also identifies the relationship between road based transect monitoring and population trends away from roads, both in and out of Western Shield managed areas, is proposed. This project will provide insight into the processes that may be negatively influencing chuditch populations. It will also be important in determining if management can be implemented to mitigate the impact of any threatening processes and identify improved monitoring methods to measure population changes.</p>"

A nutrient stripping wetland was established at the bottom end of the catchment in 2016 with the view to reducing nutrient export from the catchment. While effective in reducing loads during winter and spring flows, the wetland is bypassed during low flow periods. This is important given the nature of soils in the catchment and shallow groundwater. Key performance indicators for nutrient (TN and TP) management of Ellen Brook have not been met in the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Since residential commenced in 1993s following the EPA approval, the Ellen Brook catchment has undergone significant changes in land use land cover (LULC) transitioning a landscape dominated by trees, crop and farm, animal keeping, and horticulture (&gt;85%) to partial urban. &nbsp;Given its location adjacent to the Gnangara Groundwater Mound and Swan Valley, the rezoning from rural to urban have been challenging. To satisfy the environmental approval condition in drainage and nutrient management, as well as provision of water and sewer services for urban activity, key principles in drainage nutrient management, water sensitive urban design and urban water management have been adopted.</p>
<p>To better inform land management policy and support decision making to manage nutrient export from the Ellen Brook, a refined sub-catchment model is required. In order to be effective, the model must incorporate both surface and groundwater inputs and needs to quantify nutrient export from specific land use types, to quantify non-point sources, to identify the sources and sinks of nutrient, and how they vary in space and time.</p>
<p>Past studies conducted by CSIRO (e.g., Smith &amp; Shams, 2002; Peters &amp; Donohue, 2001; Gerritse 1995, 1996) demonstrated the importance of phosphorus (caused by fertiliser application) as point and diffuse sources and transported via regional groundwater into the Ellen Brook catchment. The release of diffuse phosphorus from the catchment varies due to a range of subsoil types and a range Phosphorus Retention Index (PRI) 2 to &gt;100. Nitrogen species are not readily retained by soils in this catchment and move vertically downward into the underlying soil until they reach local groundwater regime.</p>
<p>A typical rainfall runoff model is not appropriate to Ellen Brook as it assumes that land use units along a flow path contribute nutrient in a similar fashion to how they contribute to runoff generation. This is not suited to Ellen Brook due to relatively shallow groundwater, which continues to export high concentration of nutrients from groundwater during low rainfall/runoff periods.</p>
<p>In addition, typical catchment models delineate hot spots of nutrient export based on a steady state nutrient export to estimate land use-specific nutrient export. However, the period of time that a land use has been present (such as crop and farm) can also be as important as estimating the land use nutrient export rate, particularly with phosphorus.</p>"

Excess&nbsp;nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) and organic loading enter the river system through groundwater, drainage and catchment runoff.

<p>Water quality improvement plans are in place to improve environmental outcomes in the medium-term.

<p>For the oxygenation plants to meet these targets they need to be tailored to work at maximum efficiency. Two oxygenation plants are located in the Upper Swan estuary at Guildford and Caversham.

These factors make it difficult to estimate the water balance and the corresponding oxygen demand, which influence the efficiency of oxygenation operation.&nbsp;</p>"
2608,"<p><em>1) Building the map: Collate existing information on Ramsar sites.</em></p>
<p>Most WA Ramsar sites have been the focus of short-term studies or have some ongoing monitoring. These data are scattered among public and private institutions (NRM groups, other community groups, universities, and state government agencies) and much of this data has not been formally analyzed or published. This hinders the ability of DBCA to report on the status of these wetlands or to identify research priorities and avoid duplication. We propose to create an internally directed data repository (most likely Data Catalogue) and a shared bibliography for publications.</p>
<p><em>2) Constructing a common foundation: Understand spatial and temporal patterns in primary drivers of wetland character</em></p>
<p>Ecological Character Descriptions for Ramsar sites recognise that spatial and temporal patterns in hydrology, water quality, and vegetation structure are the major drivers of wetland biodiversity and character. In fact, two-thirds of LACs (98 of 156) relate to these groups of variables. These gross habitat descriptors can therefore be used as surrogates for changes in biodiversity. We will use a combination of remote sensing, drone imaging, installed sensors and on-site work, to track spatial and temporal patterns in these core drivers of biodiversity. A component of this work will be modelling of depth data from the former South West Wetland Management Program (SWWMP) using remotely sensed water presence.</p>
<p>This basic information will assist with development of improved conceptual models of how dynamic wetlands are through time, help to define/refine LACs and will flag potential changes in ecological character. This component will be undertaken on a rolling basis with frequency and intensity of field work determined by budget and location, with the goal of monitoring the above factors at all Ramsar sites on at least a rolling five-year basis. Wetlands in the southwest may be visited more frequently, but we will also partner with regional conservation managers and other groups to reduce the length of time between data collection events. For example, we will work with local mangers to develop protocols for the regular collection of water quality samples.</p>
<p><em>3) The original Ramsar criterion: Waterbirds.</em></p>
<p>Most WA Ramsar wetlands were selected on the basis that they provide habitat for significant diversity and numbers of waterbirds. While the criteria for Ramsar listing have broadened, waterbirds remain a focus at most Ramsar wetlands and 29 LACs relate to waterbirds. Waterbirds are also a major consideration for potential new Ramsar wetlands in WA (e.g. Lake Gregory, Fortescue Marsh, Lake McLeod, Lake Carnegie). Waterbirds are also highly responsive to changes in wetland condition. Thus, we will continue waterbird monitoring at the subset of Ramsar sites where monitoring is ongoing and expand regular monitoring to other sites. An exception will be Roebuck Bay and Eighty Mile Beach where there is already a well established shorebird monitoring program coordinated by Birdlife and supported by DBCA's Kimberley Region and where high-level shorebird expertise and capacity is required.</p>
<p>Other components of wetland ecosystems will be included in monitoring programs as and when required to fill site and wetland specific knowledge gaps. For example, there have been significant changes to water quality within some Muir-Byenup wetlands that are known to support endemic threatened fish but there has been no survey for these in over a decade.</p>","<p><strong>Aim 1</strong> &ndash; Reduced time invested in collating data for reporting. Clear map of where to focus efforts that address key knowledge gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2</strong> &ndash; Improved ability to report on limits of acceptable change in the ECDs through monitoring of critical habitat quality and quantity as surrogate indicators of broader wetland health and biodiversity values.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 3</strong> &ndash; Consistent data on which to base assessments of limits of acceptable change and listing criteria associated with waterbird populations.</p>

Loss of wetland area globally is estimated to be greater than 50% and degradation is significant and continuing in Western Australia. While the general intent of the convention is to conserve all wetlands, the focus is on selected wetlands with representative and high value ecology, botany, zoology, or environments (Ramsar Convention 1987). 1800 wetlands across the world have Ramsar designation, with Australia having 66 of these, 12 of which are in Western Australia (Department of Environment and Conservation 2012) comprising over 100 individual wetlands. The Department of Biodiversity, Conservation, and Attractions is responsible for reporting on the condition of Ramsar wetlands in WA, and managing those within conservation tenure, but does not currently have a structured monitoring program to report on the status of Ramsar sites. The research and monitoring program outlined here will address this gap in DBCA's capabilities.</p>
<p>Nearly all Ramsar sites in WA have some ongoing (or current but short-term) monitoring or have been the focus of past studies. Various organizations are associated with these projects, including DBCA, DWER, NRM groups, local community groups, and universities. This complicates DBCA's task of reporting on trends at Ramsar sites as the data are scattered, not always easily accessible or not collected and analyzed using standardized methods. Thus, a component of this project is an accounting of past and present research and monitoring, which will avoid duplication, identify a standardized set of monitoring variables, and identify knowledge gaps and opportunities. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each of the 12 WA Ramsar sites, there is an Ecological Character Description (ECD) which outlines &ldquo;limits of acceptable change&rdquo; (LACs) for a variety of biological, hydrological and water quality variables. These are a combination of drivers and biological values and represent the amount of variation considered normal at the time they were established, meaning that measures outside the limits indicate a potential change in ecological character and loss of the value(s) for which the site gained Ramsar status. While these limits identify potential environmental variables to include in a standardized Ramsar monitoring program, they were determined using the (often limited) knowledge and data available at the time of listing and the limits may need re-assessing or refining and there may be other variables that are better suited to evaluate wetland condition. Some limits of acceptable change could not be set because there is (or was) inadequate data. Furthermore, there are more limits of acceptable change listed (&gt;150) in ECDs than can be monitored with a realistic budget. Thus, the variables included in the monitoring program need to be strategically selected to ensure the most efficient use of limited resources as well as to ensure that they relate to critical components or processes that maintain the ecological character of a site. Some of the work undertaken under this project will derive or improve limits of acceptable change.</p>
<p>An important element of this project will be working with conservation managers within DBCA, other agencies and non-government organisations to create a monitoring program that informs, and monitors the effectiveness of, wetland management.</p>"

Each population has unique combinations of attributes that mediate exposure to threats, and a range of traits that mediate susceptibility to these threats. The combination of large numbers of taxa and populations, and variable exposure, and susceptibility to, threats, creates a substantial challenge for allocating resources for monitoring and management to maximize flora recovery. Structured Decision Making (SDM) is a formal collaborative <em>process </em>designed to facilitate decision making in multi-objective, value-laden contexts characterized by limited resources, uncertainty, and difficult trade-offs. By evaluating risks and benefits for management across multiple taxa, considering cost-effectiveness, and explicitly characterising uncertainty, we can identify options <em>most likely to maximise objectives, given what we know</em>. By fully costing options we will have a powerful tool to support the Wheatbelt in identifying opportunities for leverage and identifying priorities when seeking additional funds from partners or outside agencies for projects not within the scope of existing budget constraints.&nbsp;For the Wheatbelt (with potential to expand if other regions see value in the approach), we will pilot a collaborative SDM process designed to (i) extend existing decision processes for managing Wheatbelt threatened flora by incorporating flora traits and their interaction with threats, (ii) conduct a decision analysis that will support cost-effective allocation of resources for Wheatbelt threatened flora, (iii) incorporate multiple values to inform actions and (iv) develop a process to identify the value of information for threatened flora monitoring to maximise the biodiversity benefits of that activity.&nbsp;</p>"
364,"<p>Climate directly influences the distribution, abundance and health of plant populations by affecting plant traits that regulate the timing of biological activities (Walter et al 2002, Parmesan and Yohe 2003, Root et al. 2003). Sensitivity to climate change for a given species will depend on its ecological niche and geographic distribution (Broennimann et al. 2006), life-history characteristics and genetic and phenotypic plasticity (Aitken et al. 2008).  Most species can tolerate some short-term variability in climate through phenotypic plasticity, although recent responses to global warming have generally involved shifts in either seasonality (Jump and Peñuelas 2005; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2008), or for alpine species, altitude (Gworek et al. 2006; Parolo and Rossi 2008), rather than the shifts in thermal tolerance that would be necessary for long-term persistence. The most vulnerable species to a warming climate will be those with restricted niches, those in regions with high anomalies in climate or those with barriers to migration such as in fragmented habitats (Broennimann et al 2006; Malcolm et al 2006). Plants with limited dispersal ability and slow reproductive rate are also likely to be threatened, and species already restricted to the physical limits of their range, like higher latitudes and upper montane locations, are presumed with some certainty to be at risk of extinction (Walther et al. 2002; Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Root et al. 2003). If species cannot tolerate or adapt to changed conditions or migrate to more suitable sites, it is with some certainty that they will go extinct. </p>
<p>Climatic variables influence reproductive traits such as fecundity, seed germination, seed longevity and seedling growth (Fenner and Thompson 2005). Although soil moisture availability is critical for seedling emergence and survival, temperature is arguably the most important climatic variable since it synchronises germination to environmental conditions most suitable for seedling establishment, e.g. high likelihood of adequate water availability (Bell 1994; Fenner and Thompson 2005). Temperature affects seed responses through regulating germination rate in non-dormant seeds and dormancy loss in both dry and moist seeds (Probert 1992).</p>
<p>In south west Western Australia there is some uncertainty about the ability of many plant species to persist under future climate scenarios which predict rising temperatures and declining rainfall. These climatic changes have the potential to impact on the region’s extraordinary plant diversity and ecosystems. There are suggestions that an almost total collapse of flora endemic to the south west of Western Australia will occur (Hughes et al. 1996; Pouliquen-Young and Newman 2000; Malcolm et al. 2006; Fitzpatrick et al. 2008; Yates et al. 2010) under projected climate change scenarios.</p>","<p>In fire-prone environments such as south west Western Australia studying the variation in plant traits known to respond to specific environmental stresses such as temperature may assist our understanding of the impact of warming temperatures on the persistence of plant species at the limits of their geographic range. Through screening of plant seed response to changes in temperatures we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve our knowledge and understanding of germination processes,</li>
<li>assist in the identification of potentially ‘at risk’ plant species,</li>
<li>use this knowledge to maximise successful restoration and reintroduction,</li>
<li>use this data as a basis for developing management response options and</li>

<p>This proposal has four related, long-term aims:</p>
<p>1.Understand the basic ecology of the night parrot in WA, in order to create a detailed habitat suitability model for predicting night parrot distribution;<br /> 2. Determine the true status of the night parrot in WA through improvement in understanding of the population demography (size, distribution and structure);<br /> 3. Understand the bird&rsquo;s patterns of decline, and assess past, current and future threats acting on night parrot populations; and<br /> 4. Engage with Traditional Owners (especially Martu people) to encourage survey for night parrots and sensitive management for the species.</p>
<p><em>Work over the last two decades </em></p>
<p>The department has responded to high veracity opportunistic reports and has supported searching effort in and near Matuwa. Support has come mostly from Goldfields Region (up to about $10,000 p.a. over several years), supplemented by a considerable amount of volunteer time and in-kind support from a range of observers (some of whom are also DBCA staff members volunteering their time). Approximately 1 TB of sound recording files have been accumulated for analysis. Capture work last year was funded by Goldfields Region and the University of Queensland (Nick Leseberg PhD project). This opportunistic work has revealed that (1) habitat usage in WA differs from that in SA and Queensland, and (2) likely sites of occupancy are also sites that are often highly prospective for some forms of resource extraction, particularly for potash. Unfortunately, it is proving difficult to provide sound advice with respect to EIA, because we only have scant knowledge concerning distribution and feeding habitat preferences. Further resources are needed to enable the gathering of relevant information, especially concerning habitat preferences.</p>
<p><em>Work proposed under this concept plan</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Assess the spatial extent of the population in the area in and surrounding Matuwa/Lorna Glen. This will then be extended to the entire Lake Carnegie catchment (in which suitable habitat persists, and in which various mining and exploration tenements also occur). This would then be followed by survey (or re-survey) of other known/prospective areas such as Fortescue Marsh, Lake Maitland, Lake Nabberu catchment.</li>
<li>(Undertaken concurrently with 1.) Determine where the birds are foraging, through the use of GPS tags. Specifically, we will identify vegetation types are they using and the spatial relationship between roosting and foraging habitat, and identify use and importance of water points.</li>
<li>Build on the above data to determine differences in the vegetation at occupied versus non-occupied roost sites and foraging sites. We will also determine the fire history and grazing history of the sites and identify and rank a suite of habitat variables at different scales to inform predictive models to aid in future searches. This information is needed to underpin successful management and guide survey efforts for EIA.</li>
</ol>","<p>Outcomes will include</p>
<ol>
<li>Significantly increased knowledge of a high profile endangered and declining species</li>
<li>Robust models of night parrot habitat preference and movements in WA</li>
<li>Clear recommendations for management of EIA processes potentially impacting on night parrots</li>
<li>Successful engagement of Traditional Owners (especially Martu people) in conservation management relevant to night parrots, through workshops, participation in field survey, etc</li>
<li>Incorporation of ecological knowledge into management of night parrots on the conservation estate, on Aboriginal lands, and potentially on pastoral properties</li>
<li>Multiple publications varying from popular to technical to scientific.</li>
</ol>","<p>Collaborative arrangements already exist through the Night Parrot Recovery Team and other contacts. The prime research collaborator will be Nick Leseberg, PhD student at UQ, working on night parrot ecology and demographics. This will provide access to his expertise developed in the Queensland night parrot population, and provide access to other ecologists (e.g. in the NESP program) who may assist with habitat modelling. Other collaborators may include Dr Rob Davis (ECU) and his students and post-docs, and BirdLife Australia staff (Tegan Douglas, Vicki Stokes) and volunteers, who have existing relationships with traditional owners.</p>
<p>DBCA regional staff will continue their input - in particular, Jennifer Jackson (Goldfields Region) will have input to botanical sampling to assist in characterisation of roosting and foraging habitat, and Lyle Gilbert (Wildlife Officer, Goldfields Region) will continue to assist with servicing ARUs in the field. Once better knowledge of habitat preferences is developed, we will work with operations staff (e.g. Ryan Butler, Goldfields Region) to develop fire management plans for known and prospective habitat on DBCA managed lands.</p>
<p>The program lends itself well to engagement with Traditional Owners, especially Martu people, who have expressed interest in being involved in surveys and fire management. With respect to fire management, one of the key contacts will be Gareth Catt, the Healthy Country Coordinator with Kanyiminpa Jukurrpa.</p>","<p>The project will involve significant collaboration between DBCA staff and university researchers, and potentially NGOs. It will provide an invaluable contribution to ecological knowledge of one of Australia&rsquo;s most enigmatic bird species, and provide a unique opportunity for researchers to be involved from an early stage in the development and implementation of a management strategy for a highly threatened species. It will addresses the Australian Government&rsquo;s Science and Research Priority aimed at building Australia&rsquo;s capacity to respond to environmental change, and will contribute to recovery of a species in the Commonwealth's Threatened Species Prospectus (20 birds by 2020).</p>
<p>The project will contribute to a number of the strategic priorities listed in the Science and Conservation Division Strategic Plan. In the wildlife area, this includes strategic fauna and flora conservation programs, integrated science and conservation, conservation status of threatened species and ecological communities, recovery of key animal species, and off reserve conservation through partnerships with the community. With respect to fire, it includes priorities related to fire regimes that enhance biodiversity and fire in desert lands. It also addresses people priorities, including community engagement, conservation partnerships, and joint management.</p>
<p>Knowledge gained in this project will contribute to revising the guidelines for night parrot survey, requested by the OEPA in 2017, to improve survey for EIA. It will also contribute to development of the national recovery plan for night parrots.</p>
<p>An important component of this project will also be the training opportunities for both regional conservation staff and traditional owners in biodiversity conservation. Already there has been a number of field opportunities provided for regional staff. This fieldwork has included initial site assessment and installing and collecting acoustic recorders. With sufficient funding it will be possible to expand this training to include traditional owners, and even potential employment opportunities for indigenous rangers.</p>

The introduction of highly efficient predators and hard-hooved herbivores has resulted in massive on-going damage to ecosystems and loss of species that depend on them.</p>
<p>One species that has been impacted is the night parrot (<em>Pezoporus occidentalis</em>), classified as critically endangered under WA legislation, endangered under the Commonwealth EPBC Act, and listed as one of the Commonwealth government&rsquo;s 20 bird species by 2020. The species has been very difficult to detect because of its highly cryptic and nocturnal nature. Until the recent research in Queensland (e.g. Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017; <em>Emu &ndash; Austral Ornithology</em> 117, 107-113), there was an almost complete lack of biological or ecological knowledge of the species. Surveys for the species are still restricted to roosting habitat, because foraging habitat is barely known, and is completely unknown in WA. Until this year, the only reliable records from WA in the last two decades were from the Fortescue Marsh and Matuwa but lack of knowledge of foraging and roosting habits of the species has hampered progress. Then, in March of this year a single bird was photographed, and others heard, at a different site in the Shire of Wiluna. Brief repeat surveys have indicated that night parrots have remained in the area up until at least late August 2017 (e.g. Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2017; <em>Australian Field Ornithology</em> 34, 151-154).</p>
<p>Night parrots are much less common and less widespread than previously known and, where investigated, appear to occur at extremely low population densities. They are presumably declining slowly. However, this decline is likely to escalate as development proposals in and near inland salt lakes become more common, as is currently happening. These sites appear to support the major occurrences of roosting habitat in WA, and presumably reflect the presence of nearby foraging habitat. It is therefore critical that we determine the extent of the species in WA, and its local roosting and habitat preferences, to inform environmental impact assessment (EIA) and subsequent management for this highly susceptible species. Recent media interest has also highlighted the profile of night parrots, and the importance of being able to demonstrate that we can manage the increasing threats to its existence.</p>
<p>This proposal is consistent with DBCA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Strategic Directions 2018&ndash;21&rsquo; (Undertake world-recognised science to build and share biodiversity knowledge to support evidence-based decision making and management), objectives set out in the department&rsquo;s &lsquo;framework for fauna conservation&rsquo; (2016) (threatened species recovery), and priorities addressed in the Science and Conservation Division Strategic Plan 2014-17 (knowledge gaps; threatened species recovery). The Night Parrot Recovery Team has a draft research plan, and has commenced drafting a national recovery plan. The DBCA Night Parrot Technical Advisory Panel (including relevant departmental science and regional staff, plus relevant independent experts) has drafted research priorities for WA. This concept plan is consistent with these documents and processes.</p>"
2356,"<p>The overarching aim of this project is to quantify the diversity and composition of CRF assemblages in Ningaloo Marine Park and gain an understanding of how CRF change due to shifts in fishing pressure or habitat composition caused by climate change. The project will initially 1. Develop appropriate methods for measuring and monitoring CRF assemblages 2. Compare CRF assemblages collected from inside and outside of no-take sanctuary zones and 3. Compare CRF assemblages across a gradient of reef (habitat) types from high coral cover and complexity to reefs dominated by macroalgae with low complexity. The project will initially take place in Ningaloo Marine Park, but may be extended to other marine reserves after the first three stages are completed</p>","<p>The project will determine appropriate techniques for monitoring CRF, comparing assemblages in fished and unfished areas to assess how spatial variation in fishing pressure influences predation and prey. This will provide an indication of marine reserve effectiveness for conserving diversity and a key ecological process. Comparing CRF assemblages in different habitats and levels of habitat quality (e.g. % coral cover) will also explore how changes in habitat due to climate related disturbances and pressures will affect fish assemblages. Findings will therefore determine the utility of CRF as indicators of environmental change and adequacy of management zones in marine reserves for capturing fish diversity and associated ecological processes. This quantitative approach will provide a basis for assessing the diversity and ecological value of CRF relative to larger bodied counterparts throughout WA&rsquo;s network of marine reserves.</p>","<p>The project will initially focus on sites in Ningaloo Marine Park and we will work closely with marine staff from the DBCA Exmouth District. The curator of fish at WAM, Dr Glenn Moore, will provide taxonomic expertise, whilst Dr Martial Depcyznski (AIMS) and Dr Chris Goatley (UNE) will help collect fish with icthyocides and provide advice on CRF ecology. Dr Simon Brandl (Simon Fraser University, Canada) and Dr Chris Fulton (ANU) will help with deployment and retrieval of artificial reefs, whilst Dr Cindy Bessey (CSIRO) will co-ordinate sampling and DNA analyses of water to assess the viability of eDNA as a monitoring technique.</p>","<p>By using novel techniques to assess diversity of an unstudied component of the fish assemblages relative to environmental stressors in the state&rsquo;s network of marine reserves the project aligns with strategic themes of biodiversity knowledge, pressures and threats to ecosystems and innovative science outlined in the Science Strategic Plan 2018-21 (SSP). Specifically, the following approaches in the SSP will be addressed: 1. Conduct biological survey, including genetic survey, in priority management areas, 2. Understand the pressures and threats acting on ecosystems, 3. Identify and realise opportunities for adoption of technical advances and innovative approaches for conservation. As the project involves scientists from the Western Australian Museum, CSIRO, universities and AIMS it also addresses the approach to collaborate with other science providers and government agencies.</p>

As a consequence, much effort is spent managing and monitoring fish as key ecological values of WA&rsquo;s network of marine reserves. Monitoring currently focuses on large conspicuous fish, however small bodied species (&lt;5cm) typically represent ~40% of all described species (Brandl et al. 2018). Moreover, many of these cryptobenthic reef fish (CRF) have not been described by science (Allen 2015) and their substantial contribution to current measures of fish diversity and ecological significance are underestimated (Bellwood et al 2019).</p>
<p>Short life spans of CRF suggest they are important conduits of energy transfer in marine food webs (Wilson 2003; Depczynski and Bellwood 2016; Goatley &amp; Bellwood 2016) and will respond more rapidly to environmental change and stressors than larger bodied fishes (Bellwood et al. 2006). This is especially pertinent along the WA coastline, where marine heat waves have had a dramatic impact on coral (Moore et al 2012), macroalgae (Wernberg et al 2016) and seagrass (Arias-Ortiz et al 2018) habitats, yet the implications for the high diversity CRF assemblages is equivocal. Furthermore, the frequency of marine heat waves is increasing (Hughes et al 2018) and characterising the response of CRF to disturbance related changes in habitat may provide an indication of how larger bodied taxa and related ecological processes will react to increasing climate-related stressors over longer time frames (Wilson et al in review). Similarly, as CRF are prey of many longer-lived species targeted by WA fishers (Farmer and Wilson 2011), shifts in CRF assemblages may be indicative of trophic cascades due to changes in fishing pressure. Indeed, composition of CRF assemblages may be a valuable tool for monitoring predation and how it varies with respect to spatial management of fishing pressure in marine parks.</p>
<p>Standard visual methods of surveying fish are however unsuitable for accurately monitoring CRF (Ackerman &amp; Bellwood 2000), and whilst sampling with poisons is the preferred technique for collecting CRF, this is not always appropriate, requires extensive time under water and is difficult to standardise among samples. Accordingly, this project will investigate alternate methods for assessing CRF assemblages. These include 1. the use small artificial habitats to aggregate and collect CRF in a standardised manner, and 2. the analysis of water samples for fish DNA (eDNA), a non-invasive technique with the potential to detect cryptic and rare species (Pikitch 2018). Standard poison and visual approaches to assessing fish assemblages will also be undertaken to compare how measures of CRF assemblage vary among techniques. By collecting data from different habitats and marine reserve management zones it will also be possible to assess how effectively different techniques detect change in CRF assemblages due to spatial variation in environment or management. Results from these surveys will also help identify appropriate indicator species for future monitoring.</p>"
1257,"<p>The focus of work for Wheatstone development Project Bwill be to add to the understanding of west Pilbara[1] marine habitats (including coral and seagrass communities) and associated taxa, including their level of connectivity and their recovery potential should they be impacted by natural and human induced disturbance. This research aims to build on existing knowledge and integrate with current and proposed connectivity projects on habitat-forming taxa and associated taxa in the tropical north-west of Australia. Broad-scale connectivity studies of flora and fauna within and between the offshore islands of the north-west continental shelf have shown varying levels of connectivity. Previous studies have also shown limited connectivity between inshore and offshore marine communities but there have been no studies looking at connectivity and recovery potential between locations within the Pilbara region, and their connections with the broader inshore locations of Ningaloo to the west and the Kimberley to the north-east.</p>
<p>Rationale</p>
<p>Project B will gain an understanding of connectivity regimes and recovery potential of the major habitat-forming organisms and associated taxa using contemporary molecular techniques. The project will also use oceanographic modelling to predict climate driven variation in connectivity regimes. Primary study locations and indicative species will be chosen based on previous and current studies, oceanographic models, and species distribution maps.</p>
<p>The objectives of this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to develop and undertake a research program to address key knowledge gaps, identified in Project B, to understand connectivity and recovery potential of key taxa in the West Pilbara, and how that relates to the broader north-west shelf; and</li>
<li>to ensure data are summarised, presented, stored and accessible to Government, industry and the local community.</li>
</ul>","<p>This research will enable greater understanding of the connectivity of fauna and flora of the West Pilbara region which will enable better management of the region. Information on sources of recruitment, recruitment hotspots, dispersal distances, and the oceanographic processes driving this system provides knowledge to help understand recovery potential from natural or human induced disturbances. Ecological and management information gained in this project will enhance environmental management of current and future industrial development along the Pilbara coastline, enhance our understanding of climate related impacts, enable better design and management of existing and proposed marine protected areas, assist fisheries and marine fauna management within Pilbara waters, and similarly benefit other regions in Western Australia and globally through delivering a greater understanding of species and community connectivity across tropical systems.</p>","<p>Collaborations are expected to be developed with other State (e.g. Department of Fisheries) and Commonwealth Government (e.g. AIMS, CSIRO) marine research agencies, the Dampier Port Authority, Western Australian universities, locally-based resource companies and local stakeholder groups.</p>","<p>The project addresses the following strategies in:</p>

1514,"<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pilbara Olive Python (<em>Liasis olivacea barroni</em>) is a large species (up to 5 m in length) restricted to the Pilbara and northern Ashburton regions of Western Australia. It is listed as &ldquo;Vulnerable&rdquo; under the EPBC Act 1999 and ""Threatened"" under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Conservation Notice 2014 (WA). Limited information is available on its distribution, ecology, population structure and trends, and conservation threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its massive size at maturity, restricted habitat preferences, probable low densities and a diet containing large vertebrates (including a number of threatened species) makes the Pilbara Olive Python (POP) potentially vulnerable to a range of changes to its habitat. No decline in the overall population size or the distribution has been detected, but there is insufficient historical and recent data to establish any trends. A number of potential threats could result in local or wider extinctions including: habitat destruction or alteratlion by infrastructure or mining projects; habitat degradation around water bodies due to cattle and frequent fires; predation of young by foxes and feral cats; and the loss of important food species (e.g. fruit bats, quolls, rock-wallabies) due to such factors as feral animals or inappropriate fire regimes. Information is available on the distribution of POPs (Smith 1981, Pearson 1993) and some ecological work has been undertaken by the Department in association with community groups (Pearson 2003, 2007, Tutt <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2004).</p>
<p>In the last decade, the rapid expansion of resources projects and their associated infrastructure in the Pilbara has resulted in numerous referrals under the EPBC Act concerning the presence or probable presence of POPs on mining leases. Its cryptic nature has frustrated attempts to survey and monitor the species and made assessment of what constitutes a &ldquo;significant&rdquo; impact from development problematic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project seeks to examine critical aspects of the ecology and population dynamics likely to be affected by feral animals and changes caused by fire and cattle. For instance, radio-telemetry (Pearson in prep.) suggests that juvenile pythons rely on thick vegetation around water bodies to hide and to capture prey, while the nesting sites of adult females&nbsp;may be&nbsp;remote from usual home ranges. Females are ""capital breeders"". They breed infrequently, relying on depositing substantial fat reserves to enable the production and incubation of eggs. Loss of preferred prey items can potentially delay or halt reproduction. The project will focus on life history parameters such as &nbsp;diet, habitat preferences, reproductive patterns and recruitment of POPs, as well as determining appropriate techniques for survey and monitoring of the species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>AIMS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Collate existing information about the Pilbara Olive Python and publish research data on diet and foraging activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Clarify the distribution, population structure and conservation status of POPs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. Establish the reproductive requirements of female POPs in relation to body condition and preferred nest sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. Develop techniques to monitor the recruitment of juveniles, the population cohort likely to be most affected by feral animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. Trial, investigate and improve survey and monitoring techniques to enable better assessments of potential and future impacts of resource projects and management activities on POPs.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The project will dramatically improve our knowledge of the ecology of the Pilbara Olive Python, techniques to survey and monitor populations and what management actions may be required to maintain its populations. It will allow the Department and other agencies to better assess the likely impact of resource developments and management activities on POPs and techniques to mitigate those impacts (if necessary) and monitor their effectiveness. It will provide direction to consultants on the best ways to locate POPs and establish monitoring programs.</p>
<p>To communicate this information, the following outputs are envisaged:</p>
<p>Peer-reviewed papers (with tentative titles) could include;</p>
<p>1. Re-description of the POP based on genetics, meristics and morphometrics.</p>
<p>2. Diet and foraging behaviour of the POP.</p>
<p>3. Distribution, population structuring and conservation status of the POP.</p>
<p>4. Habitat preferences and activity patterns of the POP.</p>
<p>5. Reproductive behaviour in POPs: a large capital breeder in an arid land.</p>
<p>6. Survey and monitoring protocols for a large cryptic predator- the POP.</p>
<p>7. Radio-telemetry and other monitoring techniques for large cryptic predatory snakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. What role does fire management and feral cat control have in the recruitment and survival of the threatened POP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other written outputs would include:</p>
<p>1. Report on protocols to survey and monitor POPs for mining companies and consultants.</p>
<p>2. Annual reports to funding bodies.</p>
<p>3. Articles in Landscope and other popular magazines.</p>
<p>4. Media releases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other communications:</p>
<p>1. TV/documentaries- large pythons are popular with the public- I have been involved in 2 documentaries in relation to POPs in the past (German VoxTierzit and Wildlife Rescue on Australian TV). I would anticipate future approaches from documentary production companies and television networks. &nbsp;</p>","<p>A range of collaborations are anticipated.</p>
<p>The project will work synergisitically where possible with existing Northern Quoll work at Yarraloola and Red Hill funded by Rio Tinto (and managed by Keith Morris). It will involve Pilbara regional staff wherever possible in site selection, capture of study animals, radio-telemetry and other aspects.</p>
<p>Outside the Department, the project will seek the involvement of indigenous ranger groups and the general public to report sightings, collect scales and roadkills, and potentially radio-track pythons. Environmental consultants will be asked to contribute scale samples for genetic analysis and will be consulted in relation to survey and monitoring techniques they are currently using or have attempted to apply.</p>
<p>A co-operative study of the genetic distinctiveness of POPs in relation to other populations of olive pythons is already underway with Dr Peter Spencer of Murdoch University. A preliminary report was produced, but a better geographic spread of samples collected during this project would allow a more thorough assessment of population structuring. This would involve the WA Museum in its role as custodian for samples and specimens. There may be opportunities to involve students in certain aspects of the project and this will be explored depending on funding available.</p>
<p>Funding for the project will most likely to come from threatened species offsets and so it will be necessary to collaborate with mining companies and their environmental sections to undertake fieldwork and to carry out any habitat manipulations such as grazing or fire management.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The Pilbara Olive Python is an iconic threatened species in the Pilbara and its possible presence on mining leases has resulted in numerous EPBC referrals in the last decade. Consultants working on behalf of resource companies have struggled to find POPs and have not developed effective ways to monitor the impacts of mining activity on the species. POPs occur in several national parks and conservation reserves managed by the Department. It is WA's largest snake and a species popular with the wider public and Pilbara residents in particular.</p>
<p>It is a listed ""Vulnerable"" species under the EPBC Act and ""Threatened"" under WA legislation. The aims and outcomes of this proposed project are consistent with the research priorities identified by the Commonwealth Conservation Advice on <em>Lialis olivaceus barroni</em> (Threatened Species Committee 2008) as outlined below:</p>
<p>""Research priorities that would inform future regional and local priority actions include:</p>
<p>- Design and implement a monitoring program.</p>
<p>- More precisely assess population size, distribution, ecological requirements and the relative impacts of threatening processes.</p>
<p>- Undertake survey work in suitable habitat and potential habitat to locate any populations/occurrences.""</p>
<p>It also&nbsp;aligns with&nbsp;the seven projects identified by Pearson and Morris (2011) in ""Project Plan- The ecology and conservation of the Pilbara Olive Python 2011-2016"" (Department of Parks and Wildlife):</p>
<p>1. Review of published and unpublished literature.</p>
<p>2. Development of survey and monitoring techniques.</p>
<p>3. Pilbara Olive Python genetics and population structure.</p>
<p>4. Detailed field ecology of Pilbara Olive Pythons.</p>
<p>5. Developing strategies to minimise Pilbara Olive Python mortality.</p>
<p>6. Reducing the impact of mining and infrastructure on Pilbara Olive Pythons.</p>
<p>7. Monitoring Pilbara Olive Python populations.</p>
<p>A POP workshop was held at the Department of Parks and Wildlife offices at Kensington on December 10, 2013 and identified the following research requirements:</p>
<p>""1. Undertake a literature review.</p>
<p>2a. Develop survey techniques.</p>
<p>2b. Develop monitoring techniques.</p>
<p>2c. Better understand habitat requirements.</p>
<p>2d. Better understand breeding biology.</p>
<p>3a. Better understand prey relationships.</p>
<p>3b. Better understand predator relationships.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed project examines the most critical of the research priorities identifed by these three documents, focussing on reviewing available literature, developing and testing survey/monitoring techniques, resolving population relationships and structure via genetic techniques, identifying conservation threats and undertaking detailed ecological work to understand habitat requirements, diet and reproduction. The project will primarily use radio-telemetry to follow the fate of a number of olive pythons in response to fire management and feral animal (cat) control.</p>
<p>Note that the project has a five year life on account of the apparent low reproductive frequency of female POPs to enable determination of factors associated with this. Funding required for Years 4 and 5 would each be similar to Year 3.</p>","[[""Role"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Scientist"",""0.2"",""0.2"",""0.2""],[""Technical"",""1.0"",""1.0"",""0.2""],[""Volunteer"",""0.2"",""0.2"",""0.2""],[""Collaborator"",""0.1"",""0.2"",""0.1""]]","[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Consolidated Funds (DPaW)"","""","""",""""],[""External Funding"",""$180,000 over three years"","""",""""]]",,,

This tourism activity is licensed and managed by DBCA.</p>
<p>The whale shark is a protected species under WA legislation and is considered vulnerable by the Commonwealth under the EPBC Act 1999 and by the IUCN. DBCA&rsquo;s primary role in contributing to international conservation is through effective management based on understanding and ameliorating pressures in WA state waters, education and community engagement.</p>
<p>To address the pressures, present in State waters, the Whale Shark Interaction Management Program No 27 was developed in 1997. A new management plan came into effect in 2013 &lsquo;Wildlife Management Program no. 57: <em>Whale shark management with particular reference to Ningaloo Marine Park&rsquo;</em>. This updated plan includes strategies for research and monitoring to assess whether wildlife interaction tourism has caused short- or long-term impacts on whale shark behaviour in NMP, and to inform management. Several projects have been undertaken to address priority research needs since the management plan was revised in 2013. However, a stocktake of research is required to assess the completion of management strategies and identify ongoing information needs to best manage the industry. It is also timely to evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies within the plan in minimising impacts to whale sharks from tourism interactions.</p>"
2593,"<p>The project has two primary aims:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working in collaboration with Species and Communities Branch:</p>
<p>1. Develop a strategic framework for translocation decision making</p>
<p>2. Identify strategic priorities for translocation for case study species.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These aims will be achieved through the application of Structured Decision Making to a range of case studies to identify core principles. In each case costs, benefits and risks of proposed translocation strategies will be evaluated. The case study work will focus on translocations proposed over the next three years with source populations or proposed release sites in Western Australia to identify safe low-risk collection strategies that maximise conservation benefits for all target species and balance multiple competing demands for animals with the risks and benefits to each species.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","<p>An explicit approach to assessing multi-species translocation risks and benefits will be developed, supporting transparent and accountable risk management, and ultimately enhancing translocation success, source population security, and ecosystem benefits. The project will result in the development and application of novel methods, inform translocation decision making, and align DBCA practice with IUCN best-practice recommendations.</p>","<p>Student Paper: Network interaction model for DHI: Michael Bode (QUT), Katie Peterson (JCU) (completed ~Jan2020).

Translocation is a valuable conservation tool that can yield significant benefits but can also be either costly and high risk. Decisions on translocations must include thorough consideration of potential benefits, weighed against costs and risks of the translocation and alternative options. It is important to manage source and translocated populations holistically so that genetic diversity of all populations (within WA and nationally) is maximised, and risks to source populations are minimised. Structured Decision Making&nbsp;is an effective process designed to ensure transparent and effective decision making under risk and uncertainty, and where tradeoffs are present. Use of structured decision making (SDM) is recommended best-practice for managing translocation risks (IUCN SSC 2013 Guidelines for Reintroductions and other conservation translocations Version 1.0).&nbsp;</p>
