Climate indirectly affects plants and animals by impacting on many of the most significant forces they experience, including fire, diseases, invasive species and salinity. Climate change has the potential to significantly impact on Western Australia's natural biological diversity. Climate research through the Indian Ocean Climate Initiative program has demonstrated that climate conditions in south-west Western Australia have changed significantly during the past 40 years; in particular, the climate is becoming warmer and drier. Climate projections indicate that Western Australia faces ongoing climate changes. Managing the potential impacts of climate change on Western Australia's biodiversity requires sound knowledge of the vulnerability of species and communities to direct and indirect impacts. The Biodiversity and Climate Change Unit focuses on research to develop an understanding of these impacts, especially the impacts on the potentially 'at risk' species, communities and ecosystems of Western Australia.
