The WATTLE – Acacias of Australia interactive key and information system on CD was published in 2001 jointly by ABRS and CALM in collaboration with a range of participating institutions. It has been widely used throughout Australia and the world for identification of Australian acacias, and is one of the most successful publications of its kind.

 

 

In 2010, the Atlas of Living Australia offered project funding to develop a new, updated edition of WATTLE and to deploy this through the ALA as prime delivery mechanism, perhaps with a CD edition as a secondary format.

 

 

Accordingly, this project has been an update, reappraisal and extension of the original identification tool and information system, with novel aspects derived from its delivery over the internet in an aggregation framework (the ALA) rather than via CD as an integrated, more conventional publication. The project will add all new species described since the original publication, enhance the original publication with corrected and refined coding where necessary, and update the _Flora of Australia_ Online treatment to match the new version.

There has been a large number of studies of catchment hydrology in the forests of south-west Western Australia and these studies have provided an adequate understanding of hydrologic processes and the impact of forest management on catchment hydrology.  A review of these studies was undertaken as a part of developing the current Forest Management Plan and changes in practice were adopted as a result.  The current practices represent a conservative, precautionary approach to the management of forests to ensure the protection of potable water supplies.  Nevertheless, there have been no catchment studies on the hydrologic impacts of the current silvicultural practices in jarrah forest.

 

Three research catchments in the Yarragil Brook catchment area in the IRZ in the northern jarrah forest are available in which monitoring of groundwater level, stream flow, stream salinity, and salt load is ongoing and for which records good exist for at least the previous ten years.  More limited records exist going back to the mid 1970's.  Unfortunately, the Water and Rivers Commission who were monitoring these catchment, have recently ceased this monitoring.  CALM now undertakes monitoring of hydrologic variables in these catchments.

 

Two of the catchments, 4X and 6C, occur in areas subject to logging in the near future.  This project aims to impose logging treatments in 4X and 6C, to use the third catchment, Wuraming, as a control, and to continue the hydrological monitoring.

 

 

The logging prescription proposed for 4X is the standard prescription for the IRZ.  This is a more conservative prescription than that applied to the high rainfall zone, and includes the retention of at least 30% of the catchment at a basal area of at least 15m2ha-1 for a period of at least 15 years after harvesting the remainder of the catchment.

 

 

The experimental prescription proposed for 6C is less conservative than the standard, i.e. omit the requirement for the retention of 30% of the catchment with a basal area of 15m2ha-1 but still retain the standard stream reserves.

 

 

It is anticipated that the hydrologic response to the standard prescription (in 4X) will be minimal.  The purpose of testing the less conservative treatment proposed for 6C is to promote a greater hydrologic response and therefore to provide more information on which to model forest hydrology and develop improved future practices.

<p>(i)  Wuraming catchment: Control will remain unlogged for the duration of the study</p>
<p>(ii)  4X catchment: Logged according to the standard phased logging prescription for second order catchments in the intermediate rainfall zone of the jarrah forest.  This prescription specifies that at least 30% of each second order catchment has a retained basal area of &gt;15m2ha-1 for a period of at least 15 years after harvesting the remainder of the catchment.</p>
<p>(iii)  6C catchment: Logged to a less conservative prescription than the standard, by omitting the retention of 30% of the catchment with a basal area of &gt;15m2ha-1.</p>
<p>To assess changes to streamflow in response to the treatment the catchments are calibrated by establishing a regression between the treated catchment and the control for annual streamflow.  Annual values of streamflow are then predicted from the regression post-logging and the response to logging calculated as the difference between observed and predicted.</p>

1260,,"<p>Penguin Island (PI) and the surrounding shallow waters of Shoalwater Islands Marine Park (SIMP) are a popular destination for Perth locals, national and international tourists. In managing the marine bio-physical assets of SIMP the Department of Parks and Wildlife (DPaW) also has a responsibility for providing, managing and maintaining appropriate access opportunities and protection for visitors who are involved in visitation and appreciation of the natural environment. PI is also an important habitat for coastal birds, including the EPBC listed little penguin, _Eudyptula minor_ whose largest WA colony is found nesting on the island. In 1996, this colony of genetically distinct penguins was given the highest conservation status of all colonies in Australia, and these penguins remain a key performance indicator for management in the Shoalwater Islands Marine Park. As part of the visitor management process, DPaW measures change in visitor participation. In the case of PI, visitation (visitor participation) is predominantly measured through counts of people arriving on commercial tourist operator vessels. Although the majority of visitors reach PI on these vessels, other visitors intermittently arrive by crossing a sand bar that joins the Island to the mainland. To monitor these arrivals, the use of remote cameras offers DPaW the opportunity of making more informed choices of how to manage visitor risk. This is needed, as at low tide the sandbar may be partially exposed from the water for much of its length which can make the journey seem secure, when in fact rising tides and wind driven currents can make the trip hazardous. Although warning signs are present both on the mainland and Penguin Island advising visitors of the risks inherent in the sandbar crossing, these are regularly ignored and staff often spend many hours assisting and rescuing visitors who have run into difficulties. Historically crossing the sandbar has resulted in two deaths and multiple rescues of people who have tried to access or leave Penguin Island via the sandbar. In December 2010, a drowning incident instigated a coroner's inquest and further management recommendations, in addition to existing strategies, have been introduced into the daily management of Penguin Island. These include, but are not limited to o The development of a standard operating procedure for closing the sandbar during high risk sea conditions o Parks and Wildlife contracting Surf Life Saving Australia for beach patrols and informing the public of the dangers of crossing the sandbar on foot o Increased presence of Parks and Wildlife staff and ranger patrols during high risk periods o Increased number of contacts by Parks and Wildlife rangers informing the public of the dangers by crossing the sandbar o Review of signage and introduction of an electronic board outlining sandbar closures Due to the inherent risks associated with crossing the sandbar to access Penguin Island, Parks and Wildlife, under the direction of the coroners working group, has been tasked with assessing visitor risk and identifying the conditions under which risk may be further mitigated. The same remote camera set-up can also be used to inform marine park managers on the condition of the little penguin colony. The number of little penguins counted from nightly imagery (infrared) provides an early indication of behavioural changes that may occur as a result of increased pressures on little penguins during the breeding season. This is particularly important as the period of highest visitor participation on PI coincides with breeding and moulting of little penguins, both periods when little penguins are at their most vulnerable.</p>","<ul>

<p>Final Report 2 - 30 June 2015 Access and human use at Penguin Island and related implications for management of Marine Park assets and visitor risk</p>",,"<p>A FOSCAM IP outdoor 1MP outdoor camera will be used mounted on a 3m high light pole at the end of the jetty on Penguin Island (Figure 1). The camera will face the sandbar and record video footage between 7am to 6pm daily from May 2013 to March 2015. The camera will be connected to a ubiquity HF transmitter that routes to a MiniMac computer located on Penguin Island (Figure 2). Remote communication with the computer and camera is achieved via a Vivid Wireless link on Penguin Island. Visitors using the sandbar to access and leave Penguin Island will be logged from the daily video recordings. The equipment carried by visitors crossing the sandbar will be documented and used to determine their intentions for crossing.</p>
<p>Data on the number of visitors using the ferry will be collected to compare with the number of visitors using the sandbar as an access and leaving point to/from the island. The daily average number of visitors will be compared to the daily average number surveyed using the remote camera. The same days will be chosen for both visitor and ferry counts.</p>
<p>Sea conditions, including tide conditions and type will be assessed using Austides (2013 and 2014) software program. In addition, a number of other risk metrics will also be assessed from reviewing the video and linking the time stamp to available weather information (Table 1). In this analysis, two types of weather variations (clear and cloudy) and two types of sea conditions (calm and rough) will be recorded. Relatively still, undisturbed water conditions or apparent motion in the absence of wind stress will be classified as Calm. The presence of surface chop (small and frequent seas/waves) due to wind will be classified as Rough.</p>
<p>The assigned level of risk (low, mid or high) according to crossings will be determined by tidal conditions of spring and neap and when sandbar was open or closed. The period and height variation between low and high tide is lengthened during spring tides, therefore, people crossing the sandbar on foot during the middle of this spring tide will be associated with increased risk. Furthermore, as sandbar closures are implemented by in situ Department staff due to unfavourable and dangerous water conditions people crossing the sandbar during closure times will be associated to a high risk category regardless of apparent weather, sea or tide conditions. During neap tides, there is little variation between low and high tides, however, people crossing at neap mid tides will be classified as mid risk.</p>
<p>The daily average count of visitors for each month arriving or leaving Penguin Island via the sandbar was analysed with a two-way ANOVA in the r-Package rcmdr using &alpha; = 0.05. The statistical analysis was used to determine if the means of two sets (arriving or leaving) were significantly different from each other for each month analysed.</p>

","The South-West Botanical Province of Western Australia is species rich and is recognised as one of 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world. A considerable proportion of south-western Australia's plant diversity is found in the semi-arid Transitional Rainfall Zone where the flora is characterised by high endemism, large numbers of relictual (ancient) and recently evolved plant taxa with naturally small populations and highly localised often disjunct distributions. This pattern of diversity has been attributed to several factors; firstly, the presence of an ancient highly weathered landscape with a mosaic of soils and landforms providing the scope for ecological differentiation, secondly, a long period of landscape stablility free of glaciation and major tectonic activity and therefore associated mass extinctions; and thirdly, in the last two million years alternating wet and dry periods with generally increasing aridity and frequency of fire resulting in periodic expansion, contraction, colonisation and isolation of plant populations creating conditions suitable for explosive speciation. The Transitional Rainfall Zone is now largely occupied by the Western Australian agricultural wheatbelt with approximately 80% of the native vegetation cleared.  Consequently, a large part of Western Australia's unique floral biodiversity now exists in remnants of native vegetation varying size, shape and connectivity in highly altered landscapes where disturbance and hydrological regimes have changed and exotic weeds and diseases have been introduced.  It is therefore perhaps not surprising in such a diverse flora where rarity was common that 95 plant taxa are currently listed as Critically Endangered, 128 Endangered, 104 Vulnerable, 23 presumed extinct and a further 1708 taxa considered as a priority for further survey to determine their conservation status. 

The evolutionary history of the south-western Australian flora and large number of threatened taxa warrant flora conservation being given a high priority in the region.  However, although habitat destruction may have been the reason for many plant taxa becoming threatened in the first place, there are continuing threats associated with the contemporary landscape that may be contributing to the continued decline of remaining populations.  These include continued habitat destruction; the potential effects that being a small isolated population might have on attracting pollinators, producing sufficient quantities of seed and maintaining genetic diversity; changed fire regimes including reduced frequency of fire resulting in declines in taxa dependent on fire related cues for germination or alternatively increased frequency of fire resulting in declines of taxa which have long maturation times; and finally, declining rates of seedling establishment and increased rates of adult mortality through interactions with introduced exotic weeds, diseases, herbivores and rising saline water tables. Whilst all of these factors may be operating in the contemporary landscape they may have different relative importance for different plant taxa depending on each taxa's life history and the nature of polllinator interactions.  Currently for many threatened plant taxa the relative importance of the contemporary ecological factors which constrain population growth are poorly understood and little is known about the management actions required to maintain stable populations of plants. Consequently, there is often little scientific guidance for conservation managers to determine which threats/actions have the highest priority.  Scientific investigations into the limitations on population growth in critically endangered and endangered plants and the development of general models of plant population responses to changing population size and landscape context will provide guidance for determining priority actions for recovery, translocation and ongoing conservation management of threatened plant taxa.  These investigations form the basis for this Science Project Plan.  The taxa chosen for study will be driven by the recovery plan process and degree of threat.  However, there are 350 taxa currently gazetted as threatened and there are not enough resources to undertake comprehensive population ecology studies on all of them.  One response to this problem is to categorise the threatened list into groups of taxa based on functional attributes that affect population persistence and are affected by fragmentation and subsequently work on taxa within each of these groups.  Particular attributes that may be useful are floral architecture (and how this relates to pollination by generalist and specialist pollinators may be differentially affected by fragmentation) and fire life histories (and how this relates to response to disturbance in general). Consequently external funds will be sought to categorise the threatened flora list into functional groups based on floral architecture and choose taxa for detailed investigation on the basis of their ability quantitative data which can be extrapolated to other taxa.

Naturally fragmented and disjunct population systems are a feature of the rich and diverse flora in south-west Australia. Apart from the high level of species diversity the south-west contains a relatively high proportion of rare and geographically restricted plants. Nearly 46% of Australia's rare and threatened flora are found in Western Australia (Atkins, 1998) with over 95% found in the south-west (Coates and Atkins 2000.  A range of processes have no doubt contributed to rarity in this flora with many rare species considered to be relictual and to have persisted as fragmented remnants following localised extinction and fragmentation in association with the increased aridity and climatic instability during the Pleistocene. Superimposed upon this system of historically fragmented and isolated populations are the broad-scale effects of recent widespread land clearing over the last 150 years and the associated extensive habitat fragmentation

 

 

The genetic consequences of recent habitat fragmentation generally relate to the effects of reduced population size and increased geographical isolation among populations (Young et al., 1997; Barrett and Kohn, 1991).  In species with a continuous metapopulation structure, fragmentation is predicted to lead to a loss of genetic variation and increased divergence among populations.  These effects can be due to increased drift, increased inbreeding, reduced gene flow between populations and local population extinction (Young et al., 1997).  Limited studies to date support the prediction that habitat fragmentation and associated reduction in remnant size results in loss of genetic variation (see Prober and Brown, 1994).  The population genetic consequences of recent habitat fragmentation on already fragmented population systems are likely to be similar, although in those species with historically small isolated populations, loss of genetic variation and increased inbreeding may be more severe.  

 

Population fragmentation, whether historical or due to recent habitat disturbance, might also be expected to affect the mating system, particularly in small isolated populations (Sampson et al., 1996; Young et al., 1997).  There is only limited evidence to date to indicate a relationship between increased inbreeding and fragmentation (Young et al., 1997).  However, we have shown that, in a number of species where fragmentation is also associated with habitat disturbance, lower levels of outcrossing are a feature of highly disturbed populations.  In these cases habitat disturbance was linked to loss of pollinators, change in pollinator behaviour and the introduction of new pollinators.

 

 

Most of the 120 currently ranked critically endangered plants and a significant proportion of the State's threatened flora (DRF) now exist as small fragmented populations.  Apart from abiotic factors such as land clearing, roadworks and associated activities the ability of these to populations to persist for any reasonable period of time will depend upon a combination of ecological and genetic factors.  The ecological constraints to population persistence will be addressed in the Science Project Plan on The population ecology of critically endangered flora.  In this project plan the significance of the level of genetic variation, its maintenance and the effects of changes outcrossing (inbreeding) will be assessed in relation to population size and information gathered from the ecological studies. These investigations will provide baseline information for ongoing in situ management particularly in relation to the importance and maintenance of populations size.  Outcomes will relate directly to the recovery, translocation, ex situ germ plasm collection and ongoing management of threatened flora and other high priority flora.  

 

Taxa to be targeted for this work will primarily be those listed as critically endangered and part of ongoing ecological studies but other taxa may be targeted where they provide general model system information for the management of small fragmented populations.

1261,"2003-005 Development of effective broad-scale aerial baiting strategies for the control of feral cats
","There is extensive evidence that domestic cats (Felis catus) introduced to offshore and oceanic islands around the world have had deleterious impacts on endemic land vertebrates and breeding bird populations (eg. van Aarde 1980; Moors and Atkinson 1984; King 1985; Veitch 1985; Bloomer and Bester 1992; Bester et al. 2002; Keitt et al. 2002; Pontier et al. 2002; Blackburn et al. 2004; Martinez-Gomez and Jacobsen 2004; Nogales et al. 2004; Ratcliffe et al. 2009; Bonnaud et al. 2010). Feral cats have been known to drive numerous extinctions of endemic species on islands and have contributed to at least 14% of all 238 vertebrate extinctions recorded globally by the IUCN (Nogales et al., 2013). In addition, predation by feral cats currently threatens 8% of the 464 species listed as critically endangered (Medina et al. 2011; Nogales et al. 2013). Island faunas that have evolved for long periods in the absence of predators are particularly susceptible to cat predation (Dickman, 1992). Dirk Hartog Island--once a high biodiversity island--is no exception.

On Dirk Hartog Island (620km2), which is the largest island off the Western Australian coast (Abbott and Burbidge 1995), 10 of the 13 species of native terrestrial mammals once present are now locally extinct (Baynes 1990; McKenzie et al. 2000) probably due to predation by cats (Burbidge 2001; Burbidge and Manly 2002). The extirpated species of mainly medium-sized mammals include: boodie (Bettongia lesueur),woylie (Bettongia penicillata), western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville), chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), dibbler (Parantechinus apicalis), greater stick-nest rat (Leporillus conditor), desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor), Shark Bay mouse (Pseudomys fieldi), and heath mouse (Pseudomys shortridgei). Only smaller species still inhabit the island: ash-grey mouse (Pseudomys albocinereus), sandy inland mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis), and the little long-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis dolichura). It is possible that the banded hare-wallaby (Lagostrophus fasciatus) and rufous hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus) were also on the island as they are both on nearby Bernier and Dorre Islands, and were once on the adjacent mainland. The island also contains threatened bird species including: Dirk Hartog Island white-winged fairy wren (Malurus leucopterus leucopterus), Dirk Hartog Island southern emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus hartogi), and the Dirk Hartog Island rufous fieldwren (Calamanthus campestris hartogi). A population of the western spiny-tailed skink (Egernia stokesii badia) found on the island is also listed as threatened.

Since the 1860s, Dirk Hartog Island has been managed as a pastoral lease grazed by sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus). More recently, tourism has been the main commercial activity on the island. Cats were probably introduced by early pastoralists and became feral during the late 19th century (Burbidge 2001). The island was established as a National Park in November 2009, which now provides the opportunity to reconstruct the native mammal fauna (Algar et al. 2011). Dirk Hartog Island could potentially support one of the most diverse mammal assemblages in Australia and contribute significantly to the long-term conservation of several threatened species. Successful eradication of feral cats would be a necessary precursor to any mammal reintroductions.

<p>Dirk Hartog Island is an area of 620km2 (25°50'S 113°0.5'E) and lies within the Shark Bay World Heritage Property of Western Australia. The island is approximately 79km long and a maximum of 11km wide with its long axis in a south-east to north-west direction. Vegetation on the island is generally sparse, low and open and comprises spinifex (Triodia) hummock grassland with an overstorey of Acacia coriacea, Pittosporum phylliraeoides over Acacia ligulata, Diplolaena dampieri, Exocarpus sparteus shrubs over Triodia sp., Acanthocarpus preissii and Atriplex bunburyana hummock grasses, chenopods or shrubs (Beard 1976). Adjacent to the western coastline is mixed open chenopod shrubland of Atriplex sp., Olearia oxillaris and Frankenia sp. and slightly inland in more protected sites, Triodia plurinervata, Triodia sp., Melaleuca huegelii, Thryptomene baeckeacea and Atriplex sp.. There are patches of bare sand and several birridas (salt pans). On the east coast there are patches of mixed open heath of Diplolaena dampieri, Myoporum sp. and Conostylis sp. shrubs (Beard 1976).</p>
<p>The climate of the region is 'semi-desert Mediterranean' (Beard 1976; Payne et al. 1987). The mean annual rainfall for Denham (recording station 006044, located 37km to the east of Dirk Hartog Island) is 224mm (Bureau of Meteorology 2013; long-term records 1893-2013). The wettest month is June with an average of 55mm. February is the hottest month with a mean daily maximum of 31.8°C while July is the coolest month with mean daily maximum of 21.7°C (Ibid.). Prevailing winds are southerly in the morning swinging to the south-west in the afternoon with the sea breeze (Bureau of Meteorology 2013).</p>
<p>Dirk Hartog Island is classified as a 'Coastal Dune' geomorphic district (Payne et al. 1987) and consists of coastal dunes and undulating plains of shallow calcareous sand over limestone or calcrete. Five land systems occur on the island, three of which (Coast, Edel and Inscription collectively form 99% of the island; Payne et al. 1987) and are described below: -</p>
<p>Coast--occurs along the entire western side of the island and consists of large long-walled parabolic dunes and narrow swales, unstable blow-out areas and bare mobile dunes, minor limestone hills and rises and steep sea cliffs (41.9%);</p>
<p>Edel--occurs in eastern and south-eastern parts of the island and consists of undulating sandy plains with minor low dunes, limestone rises and saline flats (32.5%);</p>
<p>Inscription--is found in the north-east and central-east of the island. It consists of gently undulating sandy plains over limestone (24.3%);</p>
<p>The two remaining land systems are Birrida (0.7%) and Littoral (0.6%).</p>
<p>Since the 1860s, Dirk Hartog Island has been managed as a pastoral lease grazed by sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus). More recently, tourism has been the main commercial activity on the island. Cats were probably introduced by early pastoralists and became feral during the late 19th century (Burbidge 2001). The island was established as a National Park in November 2009, which now provides the opportunity to reconstruct the native mammal fauna (Algar et al. 2011). Dirk Hartog Island could potentially support one of the most diverse mammal assemblages in Australia and contribute significantly to the long-term conservation of several threatened species. Successful eradication of feral cats would be a necessary precursor to any mammal reintroductions.</p>
<p>Cat Eradication</p>
<p>Control of feral cats is recognised as one of the most important fauna conservation issues in Australia today and as a result, a national 'Threat Abatement Plan (TAP) for Predation by Feral Cats' has been developed (EA 1999; DEWHA 2008). The TAP seeks to protect affected native species and ecological communities, and to prevent further species and ecological communities from becoming threatened. In particular, the first objective of the TAP is to: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent feral cats from occupying new areas in Australia and eradicate feral cats from high-conservation-value 'islands'</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of obligate rules that must be met for an island-based species eradication program to be successful (Parkes 1990; Bomford and O'Brien 1995; Myers et al. 2000).</p>
<ol>
<li>community support for the program;</li>
<li>all target species are at risk;</li>
<li>the population can be killed faster than replacement;</li>
<li>reinvasion must be prevented. Eradication will only be temporary if the influx of individuals continues;</li>
<li>the target species can be detected at relatively low densities. Easy detection allows residual pockets of individuals to be identified and targeted for treatment;</li>
<li>the cost can be justified and resources must be sufficient to fund the program to its conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these rules, an additional requirement for successful eradication must be that the lines of authority must be clear and must allow the individual or lead agency to take all necessary actions (Myers et al. 2000).</p>
<p>The eradication of feral cats proposed for Dirk Hartog Island follows a similar course of action (phases) outlined by Ramsey et al. (2011). Their first phase involves a succession of removal events that reduce the pest population to such low levels that further efforts often do not find and remove any more animals. Their second phase attempts to validate or assess whether in fact this lack of detection means eradication may have been achieved. Assuming no more pests are found, their third phase is one of surveillance to confirm the assessment and it may continue until a decision is made to stop and declare the eradication a success. Detecting survivors and interpreting the lack of such detections to set stop rules are critical elements of this strategy (Ibid.). Their process collects spatially explicit data on the numbers of animals removed and on the effort to do this as it proceeds.</p>
<p>The size of Dirk Hartog Island, in particular its length, pose logistical constraints on conducting an eradication campaign across the entire island simultaneously. It is not practical or feasible to monitor for cat activity over such a large area and as such, the eradication campaign will be conducted in stages. Each of these stages is outlined briefly below and then each of the techniques to be used are detailed further later in this document.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stage 1 (January-April 2014) will be dedicated to establishment of infrastructure in the southern section (Herald Bay) including accommodation and equipment storage, installation of the southern monitoring track network and construction of the barrier fence (see below for details of barrier fence-line). Infrastructure construction will be transportable to provide flexibility in its use and options for utilization elsewhere at the completion of the project. Transport of people, equipment and supplies will follow the biosecurity protocols developed for Dirk Hartog Island to ensure that this project does not introduce or spread additional invasive species on Dirk Hartog Island. Time restrictions due to delays in delivery of the barge have meant that only infrastructure south of the barrier fence can be established within this time period. Infrastructure north of the fence (Sandy Bay accommodation site) and installation of the northern monitoring track network will need to be established when time permits later in 2014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stage 2 (May/June 2014-May/June 2015) [Phase 1] a baiting campaign will be conducted May/June 2014 south of the cat barrier fence, an area of approximately 220km2. An intensive monitoring program will be adopted following the baiting campaign to locate any cat activity. Where warranted, ground-baiting and trapping will be implemented to remove any cats that remain. [Phase 2] At the completion of the monitoring/trapping program, a team of detector dogs and their handlers will be contracted to independently verify eradication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stage 3 (May/June 2015-May/June 2016) [Phase 1] a baiting campaign will be conducted May/June 2015 north of the cat barrier fence, an area of approximately 420km2. As above, an intensive monitoring program will be adopted following the baiting campaign to locate any cat activity. Where warranted, ground-baiting and trapping will be implemented to remove any cats that remain. [Phase 2] At the completion of the monitoring/trapping program, a team of detector dogs and their handlers will be contracted to independently verify eradication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stage 4 June 2016-June 2018) [Phase 3] a two year surveillance monitoring program will be instigated for a further two years prior to any native species reintroductions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that delays in getting a barge built and delivered have resulted in a number of setbacks to the start date for this campaign. It is now anticipated that the program will commence at the beginning of 2014 and will be conducted over a five-year period (2014-2018). The barge is a critical component to the conduct of the project and will be used for to transport infrastructure materials, vehicles, equipment and personnel to the island.</p>
<p>Cat Barrier Fence</p>
<p>A temporary electrified cat barrier fence is being constructed east-west across the island at Herald Bay (13km in length) effectively dividing the island into two allowing a concentration of control efforts in the two discrete sections of the island (see location Fig. 4). Use of an interior fence has been demonstrated to reduce the cost and increase the overall likelihood of successful eradication on the island (Bode et al. 2013).</p>
<p>The fence design is based on those described in Moseby and Read (2006) and Robley et al. (2006) and will consist of an 1800mm high 'rabbit wire' fence with a 600mm 'floppy' overhang and a 300mm 'foot' buried into the ground (see example shown at Fig. 1). Due to the strong prevailing southerly winds (right angles to the fence) the support poles (star pickets) will be positioned every 6m with galvanised strainer posts every 100m. Four high tensile galvanised wires will be installed--one at ground level, one at 750mm high, another at 1500mm and the highest at 1800mm. The fence mesh will consist of 40mm diameter hexagonal mesh 'rabbit netting'. Figure 1 shows the lower parts of the fence as 30mm mesh; however this is not required for this fence as the design shown at Figure 1 was to prevent infant rabbits from passing through (rabbits are not present on Dirk Hartog Island). The mesh is to be fixed to the northern side of the fence, with overhang and foot facing to the north. The overhang is to be shaped using 1200mm lengths of heavy gauge galvanised wire that is woven through to the top 60mm of the mesh (i.e. 1200mm to 1800mm height) and then continued through the entirety of the overhang. The 300mm foot is to be bent in the lower part of the mesh and buried into the ground at a slight angle so that the end of the foot is approximately 100mm deep (see Fig. 2).</p>
<p>Figure 1. Example of 1800mm fence with 600mm floppy top and 300mm foot, taken from Robley et al. (2006), fence design 1</p>
<p>Whilst erosion is not envisaged to be a problem because the fence is at right angles to the prevailing winds (Oceanica 2013), the fence will be monitored on a very regular basis enabling inspection of any points where erosion of the foot is possible (eg dunes) and can be modified as necessary. Where the fence travels over any limestone outcropping, especially at the western and eastern ends, the foot of the fence will be secured to the limestone in such a fashion that there are no gaps between the foot and the immediate substrate. A galvanised gate is to be installed at the intersection of the main track that runs north along the eastern coast to permit vehicle movement. The same mesh material and design, including overhang, is to be used on the gate as is on the fence. The gate will be positioned so that it swings 30mm above the level of the track. A concrete mesh barrier will be placed under the gate.</p>
<p>The fence will be equipped with two active electric wires, one at 1500mm high and the other at approximately 1800mm high (different to that in Figure 1). Wires will be positioned 70mm from the fence (anything over 80mm has been found generally ineffective for cats). Where the fence crosses the main track the electrification wires will pass underground in conduit. The gate will not be electrified, as it is anticipated this could present problems arising from tourist activities. The powering (energizer) system will be of sufficient power to energise the active wiring to between 5-7kV along the length of the fence. The energiser will be powered by a deep cycle or marine battery in combination with a solar panel, the combination of which will be capable of supplying the required power 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>Figure 2. Fence design showing the foot bent into the lower netting and wire overhang support</p>
<p>The fence is to end within 2m of the limestone cliff at the west end of the island and within 1m of the eastern end of the island. The design comprises a swinging gate at the end of the fence that has light chain hanging from its base and dangling over the cliff edge. For maintenance purposes, the locking pins of the gate can be lifted and it can be swung landward. The electrified wiring along the fence can be extended onto the gate. The gate will have a floppy top the same as that on the fence. Motion-activated sirens and strobe lights will be used to deter cats from approaching the fence-end. To monitor possible incursions a number of motion detector cameras will be installed at both ends of the fence and a network of traps installed to capture any invading cats. Baits will also be deployed 5km past the barrier fence-line to reduce incursion pressure by providing a buffer zone into which cats would initially disperse.</p>
<p>Figure 3. Fence-end design</p>
<p>Baits and Baiting Application</p>
<p>Baiting is recognised as the most effective method for controlling feral cats on mainland Australia (Short et al. 1997; EA 1999; Algar and Burrows 2004; Algar et al. 2007; Algar et al. 2013a), and has been used as the primary technique for eradicating cats on islands (Algar et al. 2002; Algar et al. 2010). World-wide, cat eradications have been attempted on a number of islands with 82 successful campaigns that range in size from 5-29,000ha (Campbell et al. 2011). There have also been eradication attempts on a further 15 islands that have failed (Ibid.). All successful campaigns on islands &gt;2,500ha utilised primary poisoning with toxic baits, with the exception of Santa Catalina (3,020ha). Interestingly, seven failed campaigns on the five largest islands (all &gt;400ha) did not use toxicants (Campbell et al. 2011).</p>
<p>The bait designed and developed by DPaW researchers for the control of feral cats is known as Eradicat®. These baits are manufactured at the DPaW Bait Factory at Harvey. The Eradicat® bait is described in detail in Algar and Burrows (2004) and Algar et al. (2007). Eradicat® baits contain 4.5mg of directly injected toxin '1080' (sodium monofluoroacetate). Frozen baits will be transported to Denham in the dedicated Western Shield bait truck. Prior to deployment, baits will be distributed on established bait racks on Peron Peninsula so they may thaw and 'sweat'. This process causes the oils and lipid-soluble digest material to exude from the surface of the bait making the bait more attractive to feral cats.</p>
<p>To optimise baiting efficacy, it is essential that baiting campaigns are conducted prior to the onset of late autumn/winter rainfall, which long-term weather records suggest for the Shark Bay area often begins in late May/early June (Bureau of Meteorology 2013). A dedicated baiting aircraft is used to deploy the baits at previously designated bait drop points. The baiting aircraft flies at a nominal speed of 160kt and 500ft (Above Ground Level) and a GPS point is recorded on the flight plan each time bait leaves the aircraft. A bag of 50 baits is loaded into the 'cat bait carousel', through a funnel, for each drop. The carousel is rotated by a DC motor speed controller which sets the carousel rotation speed (and therefore the bait distribution distance). The carousel has been designed with five segments separated by vanes so that, when loaded, the baits are distributed reasonably evenly around the segments of the carousel. The baits are loaded prior to the 'aerial baiting computer system' initiating the bait drop. When triggered by the 'aerial baiting computer system', the carousel rotates one complete revolution distributing the cat baits over the distance set by the carousel motor speed controller. The bombardier releases a bag of 50 baits into each 1km map grid, along flight transects 1 km apart, to achieve an application rate of 50 baits km-2. The ground spread of 50 baits is approximately 200 x 40m (Algar et al. 2013b).</p>
<p>A 25,000ha, pilot study was conducted on Dirk Hartog Island in March-May 2009 to assess the efficacy of the current aerial baiting strategy, the primary control technique to be used in the proposed eradication campaign (Algar et al. 2011). Prior to the baiting program, a number of cats were fitted with GPS data-logger radio-collars, to assess baiting efficacy and also to provide detailed information on cat activity patterns. Two independent methods were used to monitor baiting efficacy. Baiting efficacy was firstly determined from the percentage of radio-collared cats found dead following the baiting program. The second method involved surveys of cat activity at sand plots and along continuous track transects to derive indices of activity. The difference in indices pre- and post-baiting was then used as a measure of baiting efficacy.</p>
<p>The pilot study achieved very positive results with radio-collar returns (12 of 15 radio-collared cats ate at least one toxic bait) and indices of activity indicating that 80+% of the feral cat population died following bait consumption (Algar et al. 2011). These results demonstrated that a baiting program, with the Eradicat® bait as the primary control technique, would be highly effective in an eradication campaign on Dirk Hartog Island. High baiting efficacy was achieved despite what appeared to be a plentiful prey resource on the island with an abundant rodent population present following significant rainfall events over the previous two years. Several radio-collared feral cats were also implicated in predation of Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) hatchlings (Hilmer et al. 2010). It is possible that an even greater baiting efficacy could have been achieved when the prey resource was less abundant as optimal rates of bait consumption by feral cats are achieved during periods of food stress (Short et al. 1997; Algar et al. 2007; Algar et al.2013a).</p>
<p>Consumption of baits is not only a function of bait attractiveness and palatability but also bait encounter (Algar et al. 2007). All cats in this study should have had some opportunity to encounter baits given the baiting intensity and pattern flown by the aircraft. Despite being opportunistic predators, cats will only consume a food item if they are hungry (Bradshaw 1992); if a bait is encountered when the animal is not hungry it may not be consumed regardless of the attractiveness of the bait. Therefore baiting intensity and distribution pattern as well as bait longevity are critical components of successful baiting campaigns. Analysis of daily cat movement patterns on the island and encounter rates for various transect spacings (see Monitoring) suggest that reducing flight path widths to 500m may result in increased bait encounter, particularly in the short-term and may further improve baiting efficacy (Algar et al. 2011). However, increasing baiting intensity beyond 50 baits km-2 along 1.0km flight paths will not necessarily improve baiting efficacy (Algar and Burrows 2004). The home ranges inhabited by several cats in this study were almost centrally located between aerial bait transects and as a result these animals had less opportunities to encounter a bait. These cats would have experienced a greater bait encounter rate if the flight lines were at 0.5km intervals rather than 1.0km.</p>
<p>All three radio-collared cats that survived the baiting campaign were in excellent body condition and were obviously not food stressed. Two of these animals occupied/patrolled beaches while the remaining cat was utilising other food sources as it was not thought to be accessing beaches where turtle hatchlings were available. All three animals frequented one or more 'Bait Exclusion Zones' but also spent time where bait encounter was likely. The Western Australian guidelines for use of 1080 baits provides for 'Bait Exclusion Zones' of 500m radius at and around sites subject to high human visitation. The eradication plan will seek exemption from the requirement to establish 'Bait Exclusion Zones', as these may provide a bait-free refuge for cats, particularly those with small home ranges such as sub-adults.</p>
<p>The information gained from this pilot study has been used in the planning of flight transects to maximise the likelihood of feral cats encountering a bait within the shortest possible time, rather than arbitrarily assigning transect spacing. This will optimise baiting efficacy and provide a more cost-effective baiting campaign. The modifications proposed to the current baiting regime will maximise the likelihood of the entire cat population encountering a bait(s) when hungry. Modifying the bait pattern to provide baits in more complex topography such as that fringing the coast is also proposed. Unlike baiting campaigns on mainland sites where baits are required to be laid annually to control cat numbers, a single-site baiting leading to eradication of cats on Dirk Hartog Island will provide extremely cost-effective control.</p>
<p>In summary, the results obtained in the pilot trial demonstrated that a baiting program, with the Eradicat® bait as the primary control technique, will be highly effective in an eradication campaign on Dirk Hartog Island. The effectiveness of this management tool on the island could be further optimised by integrating the following recommendations: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Baiting intensity should be increased from 50 to 100 baits/km2. This would maximise the likelihood of the entire cat population encountering a bait (s) when hungry;</li>
<li>Modifying the bait pattern to provide baits in narrower transects as well as more baits in complex topography such as dunes and/or swales. Cats would experience a greater bait encounter rate if the flight lines were at 500m intervals rather than 1000m;</li>
<li>Considering whether 'Bait Exclusion Zones' are necessary on the island as they would provide a bait free refuge for cats particularly those with small home ranges, such as sub-adults;</li>
<li>Timing of bait application could be delayed to allow for cooler weather (but not rain) and completion of turtle hatching.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is unlikely that an aerial baiting program alone will result in cat eradication. Following the monitoring survey for cat activity post-baiting (see Monitoring), a ground baiting program will be undertaken with baits either laid by hand or strung at 'Bait Suspension Devices' (see Algar and Brazell 2008; Algar et al. in press) in the vicinity of cats that are still alive. This will then be followed by the intensive monitoring and trapping campaign to remove cats that survive baiting outlined below.</p>
<p>Monitoring</p>
<p>Monitoring is to be conducted within an adaptive management framework to inform decision making, whereby actions will be taken if/when certain events occur. The monitoring program will provide information on where control effort is required and whether additional measures and/or resources are needed. Decisions must be made while there is opportunity to act; delaying decisions will remove these chances and risk the success of the eradication campaign. This framework will allow project management to change tactics as results dictate; flexibility in planning is therefore essential. A key component of this eradication program is to employ monitoring methods that will provide quantitative estimates of the effectiveness of control operations; the techniques must also be capable of detecting animals at low density populations. Of necessity, the monitoring of feral cat activity must be conducted across the entire island and requires the provision of suitable access (see below; Survey tracks). Monitoring of cat activity on the island will serve four purposes: -</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, monitoring surveys conducted pre- and post-baiting will be used in conjunction with radio-collar returns to assess baiting efficacy;</li>
<li>Secondly, following the baiting campaigns an intensive monitoring program will be adopted to locate any cat activity and where warranted, ground-baiting and a trapping program will be implemented to remove any cats that remain;</li>
<li>Thirdly, following the completion of each of the two intensive monitoring programs (southern [winter 2015] and northern sections [winter 2016]) detector dogs and their handlers will be contracted to verify the absence of cats and to independently corroborate that eradication has been successfully achieved;</li>
<li>Finally, surveillance monitoring for cat activity will then be conducted on a seasonal basis for a following two years prior to the native species reintroductions, as an insurance policy that no cats have been overlooked or reintroduced.</li>
</ol>
<p>Survey tracks</p>
<p>Much of the former pastoral road network has regenerated, with many roads and fence lines shown on the pastoral plan being impassable and in many instances difficult to identify. The monitoring program is to be conducted from ATVs which will need to traverse the entire island in a safe and efficient manner. Prior to implementing the monitoring program, it will be necessary to construct a grid network of survey tracks to allow monitoring of cat activity across the island. The spacing of these tracks must of necessity be of width that will permit detection of any cat during the survey period (i.e. two weeks each month) and therefore provide confidence in the survey technique. Information obtained from the GPS data-logger radio-collars during the pilot study (Algar et al. 2011) was used to determine the likelihood of detection and to optimise the proposed spacing of the survey tracks for the eradication program. Analysis was performed in R2.9.0. (R Development Core Team 2009). Data from all cats alive immediately prior to baiting were utilised but only locations with an HDOP6 are less precise and are more likely to have shown a cat crossing a track line which it did not actually cross. For each simulation, four sets of track lines were located at random starting points and spaced at intervals of 500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000m respectively. Track lines were parallel to the long axis of the island and the orientation of the dune system. This is the preferred course for survey tracks for logistic reasons and to minimise disturbance and erosion to dunes. For each set of track lines, the time from initial collaring of each cat to when it would have first crossed the track line was determined. This process was repeated 5,000 times with different random starting locations for the track lines each time. For each spacing (500, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000m), the 95th percentile of the time to cross a track line for each cat was interpreted as the time it would take to be 95% sure of detecting that cat during survey. Analysis of daily movement patterns, pooled for all cats, indicated that the time (mean + s.e.) to encounter track lines spaced at 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000m was 1.0 + 0.2, 1.8 + 0.5, 4.6 + 1.1 and 12.2 + 3.2 days respectively. Cat movement data suggest that placement of monitoring tracks at a width of approximately 2.0km across the full length of the island will be sufficient to enable detection of these animals within each survey period. Choice of this spacing for the monitoring tracks and separation of camera traps (see later) is further strengthened by data collected on home ranges (100% MCP) of the radio-collared cats in the pilot study which were 12.7 km2 for males and 7.8km2 for females (Johnston et al. 2010). Thus, every cat has at least some probability of its sign being observed or the animal being photographed (i.e., one camera trap within each animal's home range).</p>
<p>Placement of monitoring tracks will strike a balance between limiting vegetation disturbance and erosion and optimizing cat encounters during survey periods. The location of the access route (tracks) has also taken into account factors such as logistics and efficiency of servicing. The track network linking the monitoring plots utilises existing tracks and fence lines where possible and has considered visual impacts and erosion potential. There is a total of 184km of secondary tracks on the island of which 103km will be used to access some of the monitoring plots and 62km will need to be maintained to provide ATV access. Approximately 147 km of new track will be created across the island. Any new tracks will be established using a rubber tracked skid steer loader (Positrack) fitted with a front mounted mulcher that will permit vegetation rehabilitation of the survey tracks at the completion of the program. The new tracks will be the width of the Positrack (less than 2m wide) and the vegetation mulched as the machine moves forward along the proposed alignment, leaving the mulched vegetation laid on the track as it progresses. Natural openings in the vegetation will be used in preference to clearing vegetation. The new tracks were initially located by DPaW staff (primarily P. Rampant; Remote Sensing Officer and J. Asher; Project Manager 'Dirk Hartog Island Restoration') using a number of software packages and datasets (listed by Oceanica 2013). Several minor changes were made to the location of these tracks following consultation with Oceanica who have endorsed track location and are considered appropriate to minimise the risk of erosion (Oceanica 2013).</p>
<p>The following guidelines were used to help to determine the track position (Oceanica 2013):</p>
<p>1. Utilise existing tracks and fence lines;</p>
<p>2. Relocate monitoring points to existing tracks if point is within a few hundred metres;</p>
<p>3. Avoid placing monitoring points on birridas or on active dunes;</p>
<p>4. Avoid areas of floristic, Aboriginal heritage or European heritage importance;</p>
<p>5. Avoid unstable and sensitive vegetation;</p>
<p>6. Avoid crossing dunes;</p>
<p>7. Minimise slope on proposed tracks;</p>
<p>8. Position tracks at low points in the terrain;</p>
<p>9. Minimise track visibility when approaching the island via boat;</p>
<p>10. Minimise visibility down the proposed tracks from main access roads;</p>
<p>11. Minimise wind tunnel effect from prevailing southerly wind by avoiding long straight north-south tracks.</p>
<p>The creation of the combined monitoring track network and in some cases the repositioning of the monitoring plots was an interactive 2D/3D process. The track placement decisions were primarily determined by the above guidelines and were applied in approximately the above order. Tracks and plots if necessary, were positioned in a 2D environment using ArcMap (ESRI) and were viewed and refined in the 3D environment of ArcScene (a component of ESRI's 3D Analyst extension).</p>
<p>The ATV tracks and fence line will be monitored for signs of potential erosion on a daily basis for two weeks of each month during the cat monitoring phase. Any early signs of erosion will be immediately ameliorated with brushing and/or matting. Tracks not required following completion of the cat eradication project will be allowed to rehabilitate.</p>
<p>1. Monitoring baiting efficacy</p>
<p>Two independent methods for monitoring baiting efficacy will be implemented: 1) trap, radio-collar and release of feral cats prior to the baiting program (see Trapping); and 2) detection of site occupancy using camera trap surveys of feral cat activity. The proportion of collared feral cats killed, i.e. direct mortality, and the difference in occupancy before and following baiting (determined by activity at camera trap monitoring plots; see Camera trapping) will be used as a measure of baiting efficacy.</p>
<p>2. Intensive monitoring program</p>
<p>An intensive monitoring program will be conducted post-baiting to locate cats that have survived so that they may be removed. Rapid detection of cats surviving the initial application of baits is critical to successfully eradicating cats as soon as possible. Detection of cats will be based on camera trap surveys which will be conducted for a two-week period each month when staff are not on the island so human disturbance will be at a minimum and the population will be closed (i.e. no removal of animals). Analysis of data from each camera trap survey will be conducted immediately upon return to the island to provide information on areas of cat activity and inform required control measures to be undertaken during that field period. In addition to the camera trap data, evidence of sign, principally cat track activity will also be used to locate areas where control effort is required. The network of survey tracks many of which will consist of a sandy surface substrate will enable cat footprints to be observed and thus daily cat activity to be recorded along their length. In addition to the conducting surveys along the monitoring tracks, sweeps along all beaches will be routinely undertaken. Track activity is unlikely to be used to provide indices of cat activity as animals will be removed during these observational periods however; evidence of sign, location and effort will be recorded. The detection of any cat sign during the course of the intensive monitoring programs will instigate an intensive ground baiting of the general location and the implementation of a trapping program at the site of the sign and surrounding area. It is anticipated that 12 intensive monitoring programs will be conducted in both the southern and northern sections of the island.</p>
<p>Cats are social animals and when at low numbers are likely to actively seek other cats in the area, particularly during the breeding season. The possibility of using several 'sentinel cats' will be investigated; these animals are brought in from outside the control area and sterilised (not de-sexed) so they maintain normal hormonal activity. Fitting radio-collars to these animals will allow their locations to be plotted and their subsequent removal. Information collected from the animals will be useful on two fronts: -</p>
<ol>
<li>firstly, recording these animals on the monitoring transects will give further confidence in cat detectability especially at low population densities;</li>
<li>secondly, once the 'sentinel cats' have been removed intensive searching of the area for subsequent cat sign will indicate whether the 'sentinel cats' had located additional animals in the area.</li>
</ol>
<p>3. Verification monitoring using detector dogs to corroborate absence of cats</p>
<p>Following the completion of each of the two monitoring programs, specialist detector dogs and their handlers will be contracted to: 1) detect the presence and location of cats so that they can be destroyed (shot) and/or 2) further independently verify the absence of cats and corroborate that eradication has been successfully achieved. The use of detector dogs can greatly increase the efficacy of monitoring especially when cats are wary of other methods and/or are at low densities. Dogs are able to detect cats from wind-borne or ground scents and track them to their resting places or dens, enabling their removal. Dogs are especially useful when cat densities are low because of their keen sense of smell and ability to follow scents over large distances in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p>The two sections of the island will be divided into blocks, allowing dogs and their handlers to systematically search the island. Blocks will be worked in an order that reflects wind direction; blocks yet to be worked remain upwind of teams who maintain a rolling front going into the wind. This will provide dogs with the best chance of detecting wind scents and minimises opportunities for cats to detect and avoid dogs. Blocks will be delineated by GIS and uploaded into GPS units carried by dog handlers. Handler's GPS units will be programmed to create track logs, showing where they have been. Dogs will be fitted with GPS collars, which along with the handler's units will be downloaded each evening to the GIS, allowing staff to visually track progress, determine any areas not sufficiently covered.</p>
<p>'Sentinel cats' may again be used to test the ability of the detector dogs in a blind trial. Dog handlers will not know whether or not 'sentinel cats' have been deployed, their number or location.</p>
<p>4. Surveillance monitoring</p>
<p>Surveillance monitoring for cat activity will be conducted on a seasonal basis for a following two years prior to the native species reintroductions, as an insurance policy that no cats have been overlooked or reintroduced. Surveillance monitoring will employ both camera trap monitoring and cat sign searches along the survey tracks. It is anticipated that surveillance monitoring will be conducted over a 10-day period in each of the southern and northern sections every three months but will be guided by 'stopping rules' used to determine the probability that eradication has occurred (see later).</p>
<p>Camera trapping</p>
<p>Monitoring the abundance of feral cats, like many mammalian carnivores, is difficult because they occur at low densities, have large home ranges and tend to be secretive and cryptic (Saunders et al. 1995; Witmer 2005; Long et al. 2007; Marks et al. 2009). Capture-recapture studies to estimate abundance are usually impractical (especially in eradication program where animals are removed when captured) because the animals are difficult to trap, leading to low capture rates and recapture probabilities (Saunders et al. 1995). Consequently most monitoring schemes rely on indices of abundance derived from data such as den counts (Coman et al. 1991), catch per unit effort indices (Algar and Kinnear 1992), spotlight surveys (Edwards et al. 2000; Sharp et al. 2001; Vine et al. 2009), scent station counts, (Phillips 1983; Harrison et al. 2002; Schauster et al. 2002), and track counts (Engeman et al. 1998; Mahon et al. 1998; Edwards et al. 2000; Algar and Burrows 2004; Engeman 2005; Algar et al. 2013a). Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages but they are unable to identify individuals and potentially confound animal activity with abundance (Anderson 2001).</p>
<p>Techniques that identify individual animals provide data that can be analysed using conventional capture-recapture statistical modelling, to provide robust estimates of abundance. In situations where individual animals can be identified from photographs (e.g. through variations in natural pelage patterns or markings), use of remotely deployed automatic cameras in camera trap studies have been employed to provide estimates of abundance. Camera trap studies have provided estimates of abundance for a number of species, particularly felids such as tigers (Panthera tigris, Karanth 1995; Karanth and Nichols 1998; Karanth et al. 2006) snow leopards (Uncia uncia, Jackson et al. 2006), bobcats (Lynx rufus, Heilbrun et al. 2006), jaguars (Panthera onca, Maffei et al. 2004; Silver et al. 2004; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), ocelots (Leopardus pardalis, Trolle and Kery 2003). Camera trap studies are useful in providing information on feral cat presence/absence but usually individuals cannot be easily distinguished with any degree of certainty especially if black cats are present in the population. At a rudimentary level presence/absence data from camera trap sites can be used to provide indices of relative activity (e.g. Jenks et al. 2011). Raw detection rates (i.e. total number of events/number of sites) are naive estimates of occupancy that do not account for probability of detection (Long et al. 2010). If detection probabilities are determined, estimates of occupancy can be derived from presence/absence data (MacKenzie et al. 2006; Long and Zielinski 2008). Occupancy is often used as a metric for estimating various species occurrence and is a function of abundance as it concerns the probability of a particular animal being at a given site (MacKenzie et al. 2006; Long et al. 2010; O'Connell and Bailey 2011), in this case a camera trap plot. In addition, occupancy surveys require lower sample sizes than abundance surveys (MacKenzie et al. 2006).</p>
<p>Camera traps will provide an ideal technique for monitoring the impact of control measures through the progression of the eradication campaign as they will allow remote monitoring of cats following each control period/activity when staff are not present on-island. Automated cameras will be installed at a minimum of 50 (see Fig. 4) and 104 (see Fig. 5) locations in the southern and northern zones respectively to survey for the presence of feral cats. Additional cameras may be installed once the monitoring tracks have been positioned and assessed. The cameras to be used are Reconyx HC600 (Reconyx, Wisconsin; USA) and will be set horizontally. Cameras are to set on ""Scrape"" program which records five pictures per trigger, picture interval is on ""RapidFire"" which is two frames per second; there is no quiet period. At each plot the camera will be mounted 30 cm above the ground on a 45 cm heavy duty plastic tent peg. The camera is to face south, and a 3m x 1m strip of vegetation will be pruned to ground level between camera and lures to provide an uninterrupted view between lure and camera and minimise false detections from taller, moving vegetation. A combination of olfactory and visual lures will be used to attract cats to the camera traps. Plots that do not have lures often generate sample sizes that are too low to adequately monitor population changes (Fleming et al. 2001), they also provide more precise population estimates by increasing the number of recaptures (Gerber et al. 2012). Lures for the camera trap surveys will consist of a spice jar with perforated lid containing an oil-based scented lure (Catastrophic, Outfoxed Pest Control, Victoria) which is attached to a wooden stake approximately 30 cm from the ground. A 1.5 m long bamboo cane is joined to the wooden stake, with white synthetic turkey feathers connected to the cane approximately 30 cm above the scented lure. A 30 cm length of tinsel is fixed to the top of the stake in a position where it is not within the field of view of the camera. This set up and combination of lures has recently proven successful elsewhere in attracting cats to the camera traps (Tiller et al. 2013; Comer et al. in draft; Johnston et al. in press). Lures to be used in the leg-hold trapping program (see Trapping) will not be used for camera traps.</p>
<p>Camera trap plots will be established well in advance of their use to avoid any neophobic reaction by cats and remain in place during the course of the eradication campaign. Lures, memory cards and batteries will be removed at the end of each survey period (i.e. commencement of each field trip) and reinstated/refreshed at the commencement of each survey period (termination of each field trip). At the time of installation, all cameras will be test-fired to confirm functionality and correctness of aim. A series of set-up photos will be taken in which a white board with the location details and date recorded will be held in front of the camera.</p>
<p>The software program 'Camera Base' (Atrium Biodiversity 2013) will be used for data storage and management. This software program also allows exporting data into formats for further analysis. Daily collection of detection--non-detection data will encompass the period from 18:00h one day to 18:00h the following day rather than the conventional 24h period and will be considered a sampling occasion.</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,not required,,,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, OVertime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"

Ecologically sustainable forest management is based on maintenance of forest biodiversity and ecosystem attributes. Demonstration of sustainability to international and national standards must address criteria and indicators documented by the Montreal Process (FPC 2000, DPIE 1997). This study aims to continue development of the suitability of litter invertebrates as a component indicator group for Criterion 3, Indicator 3.1c:  Area and percentage of forest land with diminished ecological components indicative of changes in fundamental ecological processes and or ecological continuity (tested by monitoring of functionally important species, e.g. predators such as spiders, detritivores sensitive to disturbance such as cockroaches, and grasshoppers and crickets that are likely to respond to changes in vegetation structure). 

 

 

Soil and litter invertebrate communities apparently exhibit short-term or very weak responses to imposed local disturbances such as logging and burning (Van Heurck et al. 1998, Abbott et al. in prep.). In contrast, invertebrate community composition apparently varies in unison across broader scales under the year to year influence of seasonal and longer term climatic variation. 

 

 

These observations have been obtained from landscapes with subdued topography and relatively limited spatial variation in original vegetation structure and community composition. Topographical effects are likely to modify soil invertebrate community responses to year to year seasonal and climatic variation.

","It is hypothesized that mammals, as well as being important in their own right, are also ‘ecosystem engineers’, aiding dispersal of plant propagules, nutrient cycling and increasing water permeability through digging and feeding activity. We have recently installed quadrats to measure any benefits to vegetation cover and plant species richness generally accruing from the presence of mammals that were extinct from these ecosystems for many decades.  

Murphy _et al. _(2005) have reported the benefits to sandalwood recruitment and regeneration in the presence of woylies (_Bettongia penicullata_), which dispersed and cached sandalwood seed at Dryandra woodland and Karakamia Sanctuary. Brand (1999) has also demonstrated the importance of grazing by introduced herbivores (domestic stock) on decimating sandalwood recruitment and degrading the condition of host plants in the WA rangelands. In addition to monitoring the general condition of the vegetation, I am proposing to specifically monitor a) the role of small–medium size marsupials (including Boodie - _Bettongia lesueur_ and b) the effects of excluding grazing by introduced and native herbivores  in the recruitment and regeneration of WA sandalwood _Santalum spicatum_.  

Rather than create a new SPP for this work, I would prefer to include it as an addendum to SPP 93/004 and an extension of the monitoring protocol outlined in the SPP and the Rangelands Restoration Adaptive Management Plan.

However, the impact of domestic stock has been well documented by Brand (1999) and others so these studies will be used as a comparison. Rabbits and kangaroos are present at varying densities depending on habitat and seasonal conditions (rainfall).  </p>
<p>As part of the fauna translocation program, an 1100 ha predator-proof compound has been constructed into which species including Boodies and Golden bandicoots have already been placed as part of the Gorgon threatened fauna reintroductions.  These animals are closely monitored.  Other species are planned for reintroduction inside and outside the compound. </p>
<p>To monitor and assess the role of medium size mammals on sandalwood recruitment and regeneration, as measure of the ‘ecosystem engineering’ benefits of fauna reconstructions, two populations of sandalwood occurring inside the compound and two occurring outside the compound will be fenced to exclude native and introduced mammals. Each exclosure will be 1 ha (100 m x 100 m). Similarly, two unfenced plots will be established both inside and outside the compound making 4 x 1 ha monitoring sites. Plots will be N-S / E-W orientation.</p>
<p>The following measurements will be made in each plot and annually: </p>
<p>1.      Adult trees: All adult sandalwood trees (&gt;50 cm tall) will be tagged and measured for </p>
<p>i)                    stem diam at ground level</p>
<p>ii)                  stem damage (drysidng etc,)</p>
<p>iii)                top height</p>
<p>iv)                crown condition (modified Whitford classes)</p>
<p>v)                  reproductive condition (flowers, fruits) </p>
<p>2.      Seedling assessment: </p>
<p>i)        Two 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats will be placed under 20 adult trees (40 in all) and all whole seeds found within these quads will be counted (after Murphy et al 2005).</p>
<p>ii)      The number of sandalwood seedlings (&lt;20 cm tall) and saplings (20 cm-50 cm tall) growing under or within 1 m of the parent crown will be tagged and counted and presumed to have resulted from seeds falling from the parent tree (after Murphy et al. 2005).  </p>
<p>iii)    All other seedlings and saplings in the plot and away from parent plants will be assessed by conceptually rather than physically gridding out the plot on a 10 m x 10 m grid and numbering each grid intersection (grid point) consecutively from 1-100 commencing in the NW corner of the quad. Each year, thirty grid points will be randomly sampled using a random number generator. The grid points will be located from the plot baseline using a GPS. At each grid point, all sandalwood seedlings and saplings in a 1 m x 1 m quadrat centered over the grid point will be recorded.   </p>
<p>3.      Animal activity: Diggings &amp; scats:</p>
<p>i)        The above grid and 1 m x 1 m quads will be used to sample all digs and scats (and animals species responsible) which will be categorized according to age - a system for classifying the age of diggings and scats is yet to be devised.</p>
<p>4.      Potential host plants  </p>
<p>i)        A  marked 100 m continuous line transect through the middle of the plot and on a N-S orientation will be used to record all woody shrubs and low trees. A tape will be laid along the transect and all vertical plant intercepts along the tape will be recorded according to a) species and life form of plant intercepted  b) height of plant intercepted and c) horizontal distance of the intercept,  or of bare ground.</p>
<p>Data analysis:</p>
<p>Differences in a) the number of sandalwood seedlings, b) the amount of animal activity and c) condition (cover and diversity) of potential host species will be compared across the 4 treatments using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. </p>

652,,"Until 1987, the Heath Mouse Pseudomys shortridgei was thought to be extinct in WA where it had been described from specimens collected in 1931. It is now known from only 5 locations in the southern wheatbelt and south coast areas of the state. It is also known from only two conservation areas in southwest Victoria. The Heath Mouse is listed as Endangered under Commonwealth legislation. In WA it is listed as “fauna that is rare, or likely to become extinct” and is the only threatened rodent in this State lacking a conservation program (Morris, 1995). The development of a recovery plan has been delayed by a lack of knowledge of the species.

Little is known of the biology and ecological requirements of the heath mouse. The limited studies undertaken here and in Victoria suggest that habitat requirements may be quite different between the states. (Cockburn 1978, Chapman 1995), and that fire history is an important factor in the distribution of this species. The taxonomic relationship between the WA and Victorian populations is also unknown and needs to be resolved.  If the WA populations are a different taxa, it is likely the conservation status of this species would increase.

Fire is used as a management tool on several of the conservation reserves where the heath mouse persists and mining interests are becoming an increasing presence in adjoining areas. Information on these potentially limiting factors and also the possible effects of predation by introduced species, is required.

Negotiation is underway for support from BHP/Billiton (RNO) and a PhD application

","Dryandra Woodland is a significant wheatbelt reserve with thirteen of its 27 species of mammals (excluding bats) still extant.  Since the early 1980’s there has been an ongoing fox control program that has resulted in the recovery of a number of Critical Weight Range endemic species in the Woodland.  This has allowed the translocation of these species to other reserves within this state and the eastern states eg numbats have been translocated to seven WA reserves and to a private sanctuary, in each of WA, South Australia and New South Wales.  Dryandra Woodland has been selected for its significant conservation value and as a site for Western Shield fauna reconstruction.

Many of the mammal species that have become extinct in the wheatbelt persist elsewhere in WA and the Northern Territory.  Due to the isolation and difficulty of obtaining some of these locally extinct species it would be more efficient and cost effective to establish a captive-breeding program for these species within the wheatbelt.  Dryandra Woodland with its infrastructure and availability of DCLM District staff is the ideal site to establish a captive-breeding colony for some of these species for the purpose of fauna reconstruction within the Woodland and other DCLM reserves.

The establishment of a large breeding enclosure in Dryandra Woodland would allow the investigation into a range of reintroduction techniques, and would enable animals brought in from islands, the arid zone and intensive captive breeding facilities to be acclimatised.  It will enable research to be conducted into breeding and husbandry techniques, and will allow comparison of the effectiveness of large and intensive breeding facilities.

Five species will be considered for the project.  They are the Western Barred Bandicoot or marl (Perameles b. bougainville), the Burrowing Bettong or boodie (Bettongia lesueur), the Rufous Hare-wallaby or mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus - unnamed subspecies), the Banded Hare-wallaby or merrnine (Lagostrophus f. fasciatus) and the Bilby or dalgyte (Macrotis lagotis).

The boodie, merrnine, marl are extinct on the mainland and only persist on offshore islands in WA.  The mala type specimen, from SW of WA, is extinct; the mainland subspecies only persist in captivity, but has been successfully introduced to Trimouille Is, WA.  The WA southwest subspecies of the dalgyte is extinct, but the species persist in fragmented populations in northern WA, the NT and southwest corner of Queensland.

The dalgyte, boodie and merrnine are currently listed as follows:

  * Schedule 1: Fauna that is rare or is likely to become extinct – WA Conservation Act (1950).
  * Vulnerable – 2002 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
  * Vulnerable – Australian Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

The marl is currently listed as follows:

  * Schedule 1: Fauna that is rare or is likely to become extinct – WA Conservation Act (1950).
  * Endangered – 2002 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
  * Endangered – Australian Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

The mala is currently listed as follows:

  * Schedule 1: Fauna that is rare or is likely to become extinct – WA Conservation Act (1950).
  * Critical – 2002 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
  * Endangered – Australian Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

<p>18)       2005 –Merrnine translocation carried out into Dryandra Woodland proper.  Development of trapping techniques and protocols for monitoring merrnine outside RTD enclosure.</p>",,"<p>1) Monitoring within Enclosure – Majority of animals initially released into the RTD enclosure were fitted with radio transmitters and monitored for survivorship and day/nest locations mapped.  Animal’s movements within the enclosure will be analysed using ArcView and Ranges 6.</p>
<p>Initially mala, marl and dalgytes are released into the north enclosure and boodies and merrnine are released into the south enclosure.</p>
<p>2) Trapping within Enclosure – Both enclosures have a fixed trapping grid of 7x4 at 40m intervals marked with dropper posts.  Trapping is undertaken in each enclosure on a three monthly basis.  In the northern enclosure two cage traps with restrictors and an Elliott trap are set at each post for dalgytes and marl.  Mala are trapped annually using Bromilow traps baited with lucerne.  In the southern enclosure two cage traps are set at each post.  Two additional lines of 12x2 traps are set; one in thick scrub in the NE and one in the SE corner of the enclosure.  All captured animals are weighed and measured (head, pes length, tail length and width, scrotum length and width), reproductive status determined and all new animals have a DNA tissue sample taken.  All animals are ear-clipped and implanted with a PTT for identification.</p>
<p>The numbers of individuals Known to be Alive is determined.  Survivorship determined using Cormack-Jolly-Seber Population Analysis (Program MARK – G White: Colorado State University), this will allow survivorship to be determined for a Closed Population.  </p>
<p>3) Release methods outside RTD enclosure – two-release method will be compared: soft release verses hard release.  Success of a particular release method will be determine by post release survivorship analyses using Known Fate (Program MARK – G White: Colorado State University) this will give an estimate of survival probability.  A minimum dispersal distance from release site will determine success.</p>
<p>Ho: no significant difference in survivorship between soft and hard released CWR marsupial species.</p>
<p>Ho: no significant difference in dispersal distance between soft and hard released CWR marsupial species.</p>
<p>4) Monitoring outside Enclosure – All released animals will be fitted with radio transmitters (where appropriate mortality type).  Initially animals will be monitored on a daily basis for the first four weeks, then every week for four weeks, then fortnightly for eight weeks, then monthly for the duration that the animal is fitted with a transmitter.  Locations will be obtained using a GPS and habitat and situation will be recorded.  This data will be analysed using Ranges 6 and ArcView.</p>
<p>5) Trapping outside Enclosure – Trapping grid sites will be determined based on early radio tracking results.  All captured animals weighed and measured as above.  New animals marked as above and tissue samples taken.</p>
<p>Known to be Alive determined and population models developed using Jolly-Seber Population Models (Program MARK – G. White: Colorado State University), population size, survival and birth rates can be determined using this model</p>
<p>6) Genetic Analysis – Ear tissue is collected from all RTD animals both inside and outside the enclosure.  It is proposed that mitochondrial DNA analysis be undertaken to determine genetic variability and relatedness within the population of these species.  It will also be possible to compare variability to samples collected from other site throughout the state.</p>",required,False,<p>Carcasses or remains of deceased animals will be sent to the museum when all data has been collected from them.</p>,not required,False,not required,<p>Data from monitoring both within and outside the RTD enclosure is held at Woodvale; all data is entered and stored on a dedicated MS Access database.

2605,<p>SPP2015-015</p>,"<p>Primary productivity is the basis of marine food webs, providing the energy that sustains invertebrate and vertebrate survival. As such, oceanic primary productivity is closely correlated with secondary production (fisheries) and ecosystem measures of diversity (Frank et al. 2007, Chassot et al. 2010). However, rates of primary productivity can be spatially and temporally variable and shifts in primary production due to factors like climate change have the potential to affect both the production of fisheries (Barange et al. 2014) and broader patterns of marine biodiversity (Brown et al. 2010).</p>
<p>While marine productivity is primarily attributable to oceanic phytoplankton (Sigman &amp; Hain 2012), productivity from benthic macrophytes becomes increasingly important in coastal food webs (Wyatt et al. 2010, Davis et al. 2014). However, the link between benthic productivity by vascular plants and algae and secondary production remains equivocal (Saenger et al. 2013). Moreover, local variations in hydrology are likely to influence the supply of nutrients, temperature and (turbidity) light, all of which are fundamental determinants of primary productivity.</p>
<p>Nearshore marine benthic productivity originates primarily from certain intertidal (seagrass, mangroves) and sub tidal (seagrass, seaweed and coral reef) habitats. Primary production in these systems is a likely source of energy for associated communities and a potential driver of abundance, diversity and secondary production. Animal movement between habitats or detrital transport from one habitat to another may also subsidise local productivity (Hyndes et al. 2014), particularly when these habitats are in close proximity to each other (Granek et al. 2009). As a consequence, assessing connectivity among marine habitats has become an important consideration in conservation planning (Olds et al. 2012, Berkstr&ouml;m et al. 2013). The diversity of primary producers in coastal systems makes it difficult to explicitly link sources of local production to community attributes, circumstances that may be further complicated by inputs from oceanic phytoplankton and energy from detrital pathways (Bouillon et al. 2008). Natural isotopic signatures of primary producers may, however, provide a mechanism to evaluate the relative importance of different primary producers to consumer diets and therefore secondary production (Hyndes et al. 2014, Lee et al. 2014).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary productivity in this study is defined as the net primary productivity. It is the growth rate at which energy is stored as biomass by primary producers and made available to the consumers in the ecosystem (Foley 1994). Which makes it the measure most relevant to our question of energy transfer. The north-western coast of Australia provides an ideal opportunity to investigate the influence of different benthic primary producers on the diversity and secondary productivity of coastal marine systems. The Dampier Archipelago, in the Pilbara region, has extensive island and coastal mangroves in relative proximity to seaweed, seagrass and coral reef habitats. The adjacent landscape is arid with infrequent input to the marine system from riverine catchments. Strong tidal currents are likely to promote movement of organic matter between habitats. Thus, results from Dampier will not be confounded by riverine inputs and will provide unique perspective of connectivity of primary productivity within turbid coastal environments.</p>","<p>The overarching goal of this project is to assess how spatial variation in primary productivity effects energy transfer among marine ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The specific project aims include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide coarse maps of primary producers at up to 16 sites.</li>
<li>Develop fine scale oceanographic modelling of the Dampier Archipelago to provide valuable water flow/retention data.</li>
<li>Measure primary productivity in different marine habitats (mangroves, seagrass, seaweed and coral reef) and assess how rates vary among locations in the Dampier Archipelago area.</li>
<li>Measure abundance, diversity and growth rates of fish and benthic communities and assess how this relates to spatial variation in primary productivity.</li>
<li>Measure stable isotopes of primary producers and secondary consumers, and use isotopic signatures to assess the extent of transfer from different primary producers to secondary consumer tissues.</li>
</ul>","<p>The project will map the spatial arrangement of major primary producers in marine coastal areas of the Dampier Archipelago. By quantifying the transfer of energy from primary producers to consumers, the project will directly investigate the influence of local primary producers on secondary production and biodiversity. Incorporating information from multiple sources of primary production among adjacent habitats, including the phytoplankton in the water column, the project will also assess the extent of connectivity between nearby habitats and how their proximity within the seascape affect secondary productivity and diversity. This ecosystem approach of assessing productivity and energy flows among marine habitats, often considered as discrete conservation values, will help to identify areas of high conservation value for planning and management in the Dampier Archipelago. The outcomes of this project will increase knowledge and awareness of key ecological processes and allow conservation planners and managers to consider the marine ecosystem rather than individual habitats to achieve effective conservation outcomes.</p>","<p>This project will provide knowledge that can be used by marine planners, policy makers and regional staff responsible for managing marine parks, particularly in the Pilbara. The information derived from this research will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform decision making relating to the design of marine reserves.</li>
<li>Contribute to developing accurate DBCA advice relating to development proposals.</li>
<li>Provide DBCA management staff with an improved understanding of the structure and function of high-conservation value Pilbara marine ecosystems that will improve their capacity to make informed engagement with key stakeholders and the general public.</li>
<li>Enable DBCA marine scientists to collaborate with other State agency scientists and the broader scientific and marine management community.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is anticipated that the knowledge generated by this study will be disseminated through various methods such as internal meetings, presentations of findings and information sheets. More broadly, the results will be presented at workshops, conferences, popular articles, web resources, social media and peer-reviewed publications in international journals.</p>","<table style=""border-collapse: collapse; width: 98.3372%; height: 316px;"" border=""1"">

<li><em>Mapping habitats</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The spatial arrangement of primary producers is important for many ecosystem processes, including carbon fluxes, dispersal, breeding and resource use, and can improve ecosystem resilience (Davis et al. 2014). Sea-scooters with a GoPro and tow-GPS attached will be used to film the benthos at up to 16 sites around the archipelago. Images will be analysed in EcoPAAS and the data will be geo-referenced to make habitat maps of all the chosen sites. &nbsp;This will be conducted in collaboration with Kathy Murry in Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis Program, where the site data will be used as training for habitat mapping using ARCGIS and ERMapper. The process involves conducting a supervisor maximum likelihood classification of Sentinel 2 satellite imagery (10m resolution) and newly acquired 10 metre resolution bathymetry data from Dr Mick O&rsquo;Leary at UWA from the intertidal to a depth no greater than 8 m. To avoid problems associated with turbid waters a minimum pixel composite of the Sentinel 2 imagery has been created using low tide, calm images from six capture dates in June to September 2019 providing a clear image of benthic features for classification.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Develop fine scale oceanographic model of the Dampier Archipelago</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Through collaborations with Professor Ryan Lowe at UWA, deploy current meters in bays across the archipelago as well as an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP), at various locations, and combined with bathymetry data from Dr. O&rsquo;leary, to inform and improve a quantitative model of water flow/retention at sampling sites over tidal, seasonal and annual cycles. This information will also be used to model the spatial and temporal variation of oceanic primary productivity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Measuring spatial variation of primary productivity</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Primary productivity will be assessed in mangroves, seagrass, seaweed and coral reef habitats of the Dampier Archipelago using established techniques (Table 2), with a focus on the most prominent primary producing taxa within each system. In addition, productivity within water and sediment samples from each site will be assessed to understand productivity of plankton and microalgae at local scales. Productivity within each of the habitats will be assessed at up to 16 sites. Productivity will also be assessed over recognized temporal durations (Table 2). Spatial differences in primary productivity will be assessed using metric multidimensional Scaling plots, PCA and Permanova. A full subsets approach (Fisher et al., 2018) will be used to identify which environmental variables most influence variation of primary productivity.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Comparing primary productivity to secondary abundance, diversity, and growth rates</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The abundance and diversity of fish communities within each of the habitats will be assessed using a combination of visual and video techniques over spatial scales (transects) relevant to fauna size and movement patterns (Table 2). The growth rates of prominent fish species common to all sites, or dominant in each habitat, will then be measured at each site (Table 2) and compared to local rates of primary productivity. Fish will be collected using minnow fish traps, speargun or clove oil and barrier nets from mangrove, coral, seaweed habitats and seagrass (if fish available). Muscle tissue will also be collected from fish for stable isotope analysis (see section v).</p>
<p>The importance of local primary productivity relative to other environmental factors will be explored using a full subsets approach (Fisher et al., 2018). Environmental variables considered will be measured <em>in-situ</em> (temperature) or downloaded remotely from the NOAA ERDDAP website (KD490, Chlorophyll-a), as well as metrics derived from the oceanographic modelling and the habitat mapping conducted as part of this project.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Stable isotope signatures and mixing models</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Five to ten samples of the most abundant primary producers (mangrove, coral, seagrass, seaweed) will be collected from each site for stable isotope analysis. These will be compared to stable isotope signatures (ẟC13, ẟN15 and ẟS34) of fish and invertebrates, using mixing models (Le et al 2019), to assess which sources of primary production are assimilated and contribute most to secondary production. As transport of particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the energy transfer between habitats (Alongi et al. 1989; Dittmar et al. 2006), measuring isotopic signatures of sediments (detrital/microplankton) and oceanic influence (phytoplankton) at each site will also allow an assessment of these sources influence on secondary productivity. Sediment cores (10cm diameter, 10cm deep) at increasing distances from each habitat will be taken and water samples will also be taken at each site to understand planktonic influence on the systems.</p>

659,"SPP 1999/005 1998/007 
","_Acacia_ is the largest genus of flowering plants in Australia (960 species comprising almost 1 200 taxa) and is an important component of many ecosystems, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas.  Within Western Australia there are 700 described taxa of Acacia (and perhaps as many as another 100 currently undescribed) of which 12 are listed as Critically Endangered, 7 as Endangered, 3 as Vulnerable, 2 as Extinct and 183 as Rare and Poorly Know (Buist et al. in Conservation Science Western Australia 4(3): 36-53).  Many of the Australian taxa of Acacia have the potential for economic, social and commercial utilization.  However, in order to undertake effective conservation, utilization and management of this enormous resource it is essential that the taxa be meaningfully defined and effectively named (Maslin in Conservation Science Western Australia 4(3): 1-9).  It is against this background that the current SPP is undertaken.

This project commenced in 2000-01 with a focus on those species considered to have agroforestry potential.  Current work involves taxonomic discrimination and investigations of the biology of _Acacia microbotrya_ (for Forest Products Commission), _A. saligna_ (for Natural Heritage Trust), and an assessment of the southern Australian Acacia flora for its potential as a new wood crop for semiarid regions as a means of salinity controp (for Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation under the title of AcaciaSearch).  These projects will be finalized in 2003.

 
","<p>Undertake research to provide taxonomic and other advise to enable the effective utilisation of <em>Acacia</em> for nature conservation and applied purposes.  The initial focus is on species with agroforestry potential (see above) but future work is expected to concentrate on re-assessing the systematic and conservation status of the W.A.

At the request of the Executive Director, the Science Division has prepared a scoping document for a comprehensive biological survey of the Pilbara IBRA bioregion.  The biota of the region is still poorly documented, despite a considerable amount of localised survey by government institutions and mining companies.  This hampers assessment of the likely environmental impacts of many economically important development projects, as well as development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.  New species of terrestrial plants and vertebrates, as well as very large numbers of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, are still being discovered in the Pilbara.  In addition, the region has recently been shown to contain a very rich groundwater fauna, which has considerable conservation importance and a high degree of local endemism.

 

 

A regional biological survey will provide an overview of biodiversity in the region and a context for assessing the significance of localised occurrences of surface and groundwater species (see Burbidge et al. 2000).

 

 

Stygofauna has not previously been included in the broadscale biological survey program in Western Australia (eg Burbidge et al. 2000) but lack of information about stygofauna and its distribution in the Pilbara is hampering economically important resource development projects and making it difficult to assess their likely environmental impacts because of the large number of new species being discovered in impact statement surveys. The urgent need for a regional survey to provide a framework for decisions about the conservation and management of stygofauna was identified in Recommendation 1 of Dr Phillip Playford's recent review of stygofauna for the Environmental Protection Authority, as well as at recent workshops involving government and industry. Hatton and Evans (1998, p 2) concluded in their review of the groundwater systems in Australia for LWRRDC that ""virtually nothing is known … of biodiversity"", although worldwide there is a recognition that groundwater probably contains a greater array of freshwater species than surface waters (Gibert et al. 1994).

<p>01</p>
<p>A four-year field program is envisaged, followed by one year of writing up. Formal analysis and publication of survey results is seen as a vital part of the scientific process. It allows peer review and is an essential quality assurance mechanism. It will not delay local dissemination of results: this should happen rapidly through workshops and informal communications with other interested parties. Between July and August 2002, collation of existing information on the location of boreholes and springs will begin and there will be preliminary liaison with landholders. Stygofaunal sampling will begin in August or September 2002. In July 2003, collation of existing information on terrestrial and surface-water invertebrates will begin, followed by surface-site selection; aquatic sampling will commence in August or September 2003 while terrestrial sampling will begin in April 2004. The final report, ready for publication, will be produced in June 2007.</p>

Points to be sampled will be chosen after existing biological data, and relevant climatic, soil and stratigraphic data, from the region have been compiled and reviewed.  Metadata for most of the biological datasets have been compiled by government and will soon be housed in the Science Division (Pilbara Environmental Surveys database).  In combination, maps available from the above studies and recent work by the Department of Agriculture on vegetation and land units in the region provide a rational basis for stratifying the biodiversity sampling program.  The Water and Rivers Commission's database of bores in the Pilbara will be used to locate potentially suitable bores for stygofaunal sampling and results of the recently completed First National Assessment of River Health, using AusRivAS, will be used in the selection of aquatic sites.</p>
<p>The approach being taken is that the survey should be point-based, as comprehensive as possible in terms of the number of taxonomic groups and habitats surveyed, and provide regional-level information about species-level biodiversity patterns in the Pilbara.  The survey will focus on four broad components - terrestrial fauna, terrestrial flora, aquatic flora and fauna, and stygofauna.</p>
<p>Sampling methodology for the surveys will be explicit and repeatable.  Taxonomic groups to be covered are listed in Table 1.  They include the biological groups of most public conservation interest.  Other factors influencing selection of taxa were that the survey should focus on a mix of trophic levels, show biogeographic pattern at a variety of scales, and include taxa with well known habitat associations elsewhere to provide an extrinsic context for interpreting survey results.</p>
<p>A range of physical and chemical measurements will be taken at each site to document environmental tolerances of the biota and to enable species and community distributions to be related to environmental gradients.  This will allow some predictive modelling of species and community distributions and interpolation across sites that were not sampled.</p>
<p>Sampling strategies</p>
<p>The Pilbara is a large region, with a total area of almost 200,000km2.  A large number of sampling sites will be needed to encapsulate the full variation of geological and climatic conditions and to maintain similar site densities to that of previous CALM surveys.  The suggested number of sites in each survey component is listed in Table 2.</p>
<p>Survey techniques will conform to accepted practice.  At terrestrial survey points, birds will be censused in large quadrats, within which terrestrial mammals (other than bats), reptiles, frogs and spiders/arachnids will be pit-trapped, bats echo-located and plants scored in smaller quadrats.  At aquatic survey points, waterbirds will be censused and invertebrates will be collected in sweep nets using a range of mesh sizes.  Stygofauna will be collected mostly from boreholes but sampling will also occur at surface springs where groundwater discharges.  In most cases, existing boreholes will be used although it is expected that a small number of purpose-drilled holes will be required as well.</p>

<p>Staff and associated institutions</p>
<p>The survey will be coordinated, and largely undertaken, by the Department of Conservation and Land Management but staff from the Western Australian Museum will also have a major role.  A small number of specialists from other institutions will be involved.  Table 3 is a list of staff and institutions with potential direct involvement.  We will be seeking assistance and indirect involvement from a wider range of institutions and companies, especially those based in the Pilbara, and will endeavour to maintain a high level of liaison.</p>

The development of perennial-based land use systems for the management of dryland salinity promises significant environmental and economic benefits.  Large scale planting of perennial pastures and woody crops also pose risks to existing natural biodiversity.  These risks include the establishment of new plant species as environmental weeds, hybridization with native species and gene flow from cultivated populations into natural populations (Bennett and Virtue, 2003). Invasive species have been identified as the second greatest threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction (Walker and Steffen, 1997).  Genetic contamination by native species planted outside their natural range can also have negative impacts on the viability of native vegetation.

 
","<p>This project aims to assess and manage the risk posed by introducing large scale plantings of new perennial pastures for managing dryland salinity.  Processes will be established to ensure the protection of biodiversity and prevent newly domesticated plant species from becoming environmental weeds.  The risk of genetic contamination between planted and naturally occurring species will be evaluated, and management processes designed and implemented.  All germplasm released by the Salinity CRC will undergo a rigorous weed risk assessment prior to release, and if necessary, appropriate management plans will be designed and put in place.</p>","<p>A strategy for the management of environmental weed risk associated with the development of exotic and naturalized germplasm including pre-release assessment protocols.  </p>

1511,,"<p>Aquatic habitats in the south-west of WA are under increasing threat from changes in hydrology, water quality and fire as a result of the drying climate and historical and current land use. At present, there is an inadequate understanding of the responses of aquatic communities to these threats to inform the management of many aquatic systems in the Forest Management Plan area, including the Muir-Byenup Ramsar wetlands.</p>
<p>This project has two components. Priority will be given to component 1, component 2 will be dependent on funding.</p>
<p><em>1) Re-surveys of aquatic invertebrates in Muir-Byenup Ramsar wetlands sampled in 1994 and 2004 and suites of wetlands further south sampled in 1993. This addresses KPI3 of the 2014-23 FMP.</em></p>
<p>The FMP area has many high value wetlands, particularly in the Warren region. Some of these are listed as nationally or internationally significant and&nbsp;many are priorities in regional nature conservation plans. These support numerous priority flora species, priority ecological communities, significant waterbirds, 6 of the 8 species of south-west endemic fish and a very high diversity and endemicity of invertebrates. Threats to many of these wetlands have intensified over the last decade. The available biodiversity data is 10 to 20 year old and up to date information is required to assess responses to threats and inform the allocation of resources to management actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>2) Continued monitoring of high condition streams, with a focus on effects of the drying climate and forest management. This addresses KPI1 of the 2014-23 FMP.</em></p>
<p>KPI20 of the previous FMP scored 24 of 51 monitored stream sites as impaired. This was not clearly related to forestry activities but could, in part, be related to reduced rainfall. This project would see continued monitoring at &lsquo;reference condition&rsquo; streams and those that are already affected by reduced rainfall. A focus on these streams aligns with KPI1 of the current FMP which focuses on change in &lsquo;currently healthy ecosystems&rsquo; and will allow us to track condition in relation to the ongoing decline in rainfall combined with forest management. In a region with high climatic variability long-term studies are essential to understand ecosystem responses.</p>","<ul>

"," 

Findings from CALM’s _Operation Foxglove_ resulted in recommendations to increase the standard operational 1080 baiting regime from a frequency of four baitings per year to six baitings per year for large areas of the multiple use northern jarrah forest.  The findings were based on a long term study of survivorship of translocated populations of the brush-tailed bettong, or woylie, _Bettongia penicillata_.  The preferred model to describe the survivorship data was constrained by the covariate “released in winter” and suggested survivorship was lower for woylies released in winter.  This model found the probability of woylie survivorship in areas baited six times per year was significantly higher over the duration of the study than in areas baited at the standard operational baiting frequency of four times per year (de Tores_ et al._, 1998; de Tores_ et al._, in prep-a).  Population modeling also showed translocated populations were unlikely to persist in the presence of the standard baiting regime (de Tores_ et al._, in prep-a).

 

The survivorship study, based on a sample size of 366 radio collared woylies monitored continuously over a 33 month period, also indicated the number of radio-collared woylie mortality events attributed to predation by cats was greater in two of the three fox baited treatments than in the unbaited control (de Tores_ et al._, in prep-a).  The data suggest a reduction in the number of predation events attributed to foxes was compensated for by an increase in the number of predation events attributed to cats.  This pattern is consistent with the principle of mesopredator release.  Similar conclusions were drawn from survivorship data for woylies translocated from Western Australia and South Australia to Yathong Nature Reserve, western NSW.  The Yathong Nature Reserve translocation was deemed to have failed as a result of predation by cats.  Foxes were considered to no longer be a threat to wildlife at Yathong, however, in the presence of fox control, 74% of the known predation events were attributed to predation by cats (Priddel and Wheeler, 2004).  Results from woylie translocations elsewhere have rarely been able to demonstrate translocation success.  Of approximately 34 translocations in Western Australia, only four (to Yendicup forest (Perup), Batalling forest, Boyagin Nature Reserve and Karakamia Sanctuary) have unequivocally demonstrated translocation success.  Of these, Batalling is a known anomaly as it supports a suite of rare fauna with populations of at least two species established as a result of translocation.  Boyagin Nature Reserve is within 50km of Dryandra (the source of the translocated woylies) and it is hypothesised that translocation success is a function of the presence of critical habitat attributes and effective fox control.  Similarly, the habitat at Yendicup is comparable to that in neighbouring forest areas where woylies have persisted.  Karakamia Sanctuary is enclosed by a predator proof (fox and cat proof) fence and provides no opportunity for re-invasion by cats.  The combined results suggest that in some sites, fox control alone is insufficient to result in translocation success for the woylie and successful translocations are dependent on cat exclusion and/or the presence of specific habitat attributes.  In the absence of a target specific cat bait, CALM’s ability to control cats will be limited (i.e. cat baiting may not be possible in the south-west forests where non-target species occur).  

 

Foxglove data also demonstrated re-invasion of foxes occurred within two weeks of an aerial baiting event and fox density was higher in forest areas closer to the interface with agricultural land than in core areas of the forest.  The number/proportion of foxes surviving a 1080 baiting event in the northern jarrah forest was unknown, as was the extent to which foxes may be bait shy or bait wary.

 

The interactions between the two introduced predator species (fox and cat) and the resident native predator species from the northern jarrah forest, the chuditch, _Dasyurus geoffroii_, are also poorly understood.  Predation by chuditch was thought to be limiting translocation success of the western ringtail possum, _Pseudocheirus occidentalis_, in baited areas of the northern jarrah forest (de Tores, unpublished data).  Data from other western ringtail possum translocation sites has also clearly implicated predation by cats and  pythons to be limiting translocation success (de Tores, 2005; de Tores_ et al._, 2005a; de Tores_ et al._, 2005b) and mesopredator release has been strongly implicated as a potential reason for this lack of success (de Tores, 2005).  There has been no assessment of the effect of fox control on the two large predatory varanids, _Varanus gouldii_ and _V. rosenbergi_.  

 
","<p>Specific aims are to test the mesopredator release hypotheses.  The conservation significance of mesopredator release will be examined in relation to pythons, chuditch, both large varanids and both introduced predator species (fox and cat), as will the conservation significance of intraguild predation.  Assessment of population density, habitat use, behaviour, survivorship and fecundity of these species will also be examined in the presence and absence of fox control.  The long term result will be to determine if fox control leads to mesopredator release, and, if so, which predator species show this mesopredator release response.  The research will also determine whether the effects of mesopredator release can be mitigated by baiting to control feral cats.</p>
<p>Hypothesis tested are set in an Information-Theoretic approach context:</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis</em>:       In the presence of sustained and long-term fox control which effectively reduces fox abundance, other predators increase in abundance - i.e. there is a mesopredator release effect.</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis</em>:       The resulting level of predation from mesopredator release outweighs the conservation benefits from fox control.</p>","<p>The project will determine whether fox control results in detrimental indirect effects.  Specifically, it will determine if cat abundance increases in the presence of fox control and if so, does this result in negative conservation outcomes.  In achieving this, the project will test the mesopredator release hypothesis.  The project will also assess fauna response in relation to fox and cat abundance and a suite of environmental factors.</p>
<p>Managers will be better placed by knowing if fox control does result in detrimental indirect effects and can make more informed decisions on the benefits of fox control in the absence of cat control.</p>","<p>Wildlife researchers and managers (e.g. biologists involved in assessing fauna response/recovery generally and CALM staff involved in Western Shield) responsible for a broad range of monitoring of survivorship (particularly those interested in adopting appropriate new technologies), habitat use and density/abundance estimates. The project will provide critical information on the genetic structure of the south-west carpet python from the northern jarrah forest and will therefore be of immediate value to CALM employees involved in wildlife licencing and law enforcement.</p>","<p><em>1.1                    </em><strong>Milestone</strong>__</p>

<p>The northern jarrah forest component of the Western Australian Demonstration Site will implement the major findings from <em>Operation Foxglove</em> and adopt “best practice” fox control for large areas of the northern jarrah forest by implementing a 1080 fox baiting regime of six baitings per year.  This baited area will be divided into two zones, both initially baited six times per year (see Fig 1).  One of these zones (nominally the northern zone) will, subsequently (two years post commencement of the project) be baited concurrently with fox baits and the cat bait, “Eradicat”.  Use of Eradicat is subject to further development, trials and confirmation of its suitability for broadscale application in a forest environment.  An alternative regime is proposed in the event a suitable cat bait is unavailable.  Under this alternative scenario, fox baiting will be withdrawn from the northern zone and this zone will effectively revert to an unbaited area.  Under both scenarios, the suite of predator and prey species will be monitored.</p>
<p>The study site will retain the majority of the former large (unbaited) control site from Operation Foxglove (Fig 1).  The size of each baited area is still subject to negotiation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Estimating fox abundance and assessment of use of the landscape by foxes</em></strong></p>
<p>Estimates of fox abundance will be derived through modified use of the sandplotting technique previously used and validated in Operation Foxglove (de Tores_ et al._, in prep-c).</p>
<p>A description of the technique and findings is extracted below from de Tores <em>et al</em>. (in prep-c):</p>
<p>25 sandplots, each 1mx1m were established within a grid/roading network of approximately 25km<sup>2</sup>, with a minimum distance of 500m between neighbouring sandplots.  Each sandplot was placed at the edge of an existing road or track, with the shape of sandplot grid/web network determined by the existing road and track network.  The exact area required to capture all 25 sandplots within each sandplot grid/web network was determined by calculating the minimum convex polygon (MCP) which encompassed all sandplots (Ranges6 software) (Kenward_ et al._, 2003).  A 500m buffer (ESRI, 1999-2004) was added to the Ranges determined MCP to estimate the final area capturing all 25 sandplots within each grid/web network.</p>
<p>A small cube of approximately 50g of fresh mutton was buried 5-10mm below the surface of the sand.  The sand was then raked smooth and lightly sprayed with water.  Each sandplot was monitored daily for ten consecutive days.  The presence/absence of fox spoor (i.e. track or scat) or other recognisable evidence of fox activity on each sandplot was recorded daily.  Presence of spoor was interpreted as an indicator of fox presence.  Identifiable spoor and evidence of activity of other species were also recorded.  The removal of rewards (mutton) was recorded and each removed reward was replaced.  All rewards were periodically checked and partially decomposed rewards were replaced.  Sandplots showing evidence of activity and/or removal of rewards were re-raked and each sandplot, whether showing activity or not, was lightly re-sprayed with water daily.  Sandplots were monitored immediately prior to the delivery of 1080 baits.  </p>
<p>Where neighbouring sandplots showed evidence of fox activity this was interpreted as indicating the presence of the same fox at those plots.  A break in continuity of sandplots showing evidence of activity, with two or more sandplots without evidence of activity between sandplots showing activity, was interpreted as indicating the presence of an additional fox.  Similarly, a break of more than 1km between plots showing activity was interpreted as indicating the presence of additional foxes.  The pattern of sandplots showing activity was mapped daily.  The estimated number of foxes was recorded daily at each sandplot grid/web and the cumulative mean after ten days was derived as:</p>
<p>Cumulative mean number of foxes = (cumulative number of foxes /</p>
<p>number of days monitored).</p>
<p>A pairwise correlation matrix (StataCorp, 2005) was then generated for the daily cumulative mean for days one to ten for the pooled data for all years, pre 1080 baiting.  The correlation value (r) was then plotted for each day.  An r value (correlation) of 0.9009 was observed at six days.</p>
<p>Fox density was estimated for each sandplot grid/web network by dividing the cumulative mean number of foxes at day 10 by the area derived from the MCP, inclusive of the 500m buffer.  </p>
<p>Proposed variations to the above are:</p>
<p>·       The number of sandplots with a reward will be halved and selection of sandplots with a reward within any sandplot area will be random (this will reduce the take by non target species);</p>
<p>·       Each sandplot will also be treated with the Pestat Ltd developed lure, synthetic fermented egg (FeralMone<sup>®</sup>);</p>
<p>·       Up to four sandplotting areas (each with 25 1x1m sand plots within an area of 25km<sup>2</sup>) will be established within each of the baited treatments and will be monitored for approximately 6 consecutive days each season.  Spacing between sandplotting areas will be maximised to maintain independence of each sandplotting area.</p>
<p>Fox scats will be collected seasonally, during and immediately post sandplotting.  Scats will be used in a collaborative program (with IA CRC UWA post doctoral researcher, Dr Oliver Berry) using molecular techniques aimed at determining the number of individual foxes present.  The presence of fox activity will be used to select trap placement (Victor Soft Catch, padded leg hold traps) for fox trapping.  Trapped foxes will be fitted with ARGOS satellite telemetry radio tags which, subject to developmental trials, will incorporate contact/proximity circuitry.  Satellite tags will be “duty tasked” to enable collection of diurnal and nocturnal location records and to minimise the effects of autocorrelation.  The number of radio collared foxes and hence the sample size for analyses of habitat use and use of the landscape, will be determined by capture rates.  Trapping will be carried out seasonally, post sandplotting, and opportunistically when fox presence is observed, to maintain the radio collared sample size.  The use of contact/proximity is proposed to assist in determining the predator responsible for predation events (see native fauna monitoring below) and to assist in the detection and extent of intraguild predation.  Radio telemetry monitoring will also determine if the fox population within the baited areas is being “turned over” by successive baiting events, or if there is a resident “bait shy” / “bait avoiding” population.  Similarly, molecular analyses of scats will determine if individual foxes are surviving successive baiting events.  If shown to be a viable technique for identifying individuals, the molecular analyses may also reveal the population genetic structure, specifically, it should indicate the extent of stability of the populations within the baited and unbaited areas.  The conservation implications of this, i.e. the extent to which introduced predator population stability affects native prey populations, is unknown and will be examined.</p>
<p><strong><em>Estimating cat abundance and assessment of use of the landscape by cats</em></strong></p>
<p>A combination of lures (the felid attracting phonid, or FAP), rewards, leg hold and wire cage traps and camera stations will be used to monitor for the presence of cats.  At worst, data from these techniques will be used to derive an index to abundance.  A suite of techniques will also be trialled for collection of hair/hair follicles for identification of individuals through molecular techniques.  As per the molecular analyses of fox populations, the conservation implications of the cat population genetic structure will be examined.</p>
<p>Trapped cats will also be fitted with also ARGOS satellite telemetry radio tags which, again subject to developmental trials, will incorporate contact/proximity circuitry, as per the fox satellite telemetry.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fox dietary analyses</em></strong></p>
<p>The fox scats used for molecular analyses will also be examined to determine the major dietary items and to examine the temporal and spatial variation in fox diet.  This variation will be compared with the temporal and spatial availability of medium and small mammal prey species, reptile species and invertebrate prey species.  The latter (temporal and spatial availability the invertebrate food resource) is subject to securing a stipend for a PhD student for this work.</p>
<p>The fox scats will be collected seasonally from each of the four grids/networks from each of the two baited treatment zones and the control site within which sandplotting is carried out.  Collection of scats will be during and immediately post sandplotting with scats collected from open ground, roadside and tracks from within the sandplot grid/network only.  The location of each collected scat will be recorded (GPS) and attributed according to the category of road/track from which it was collected.  All collected scats will be individually labelled and frozen for storage.  Post thawing, scats will be oven dried at 50-60<sup>0</sup>C for 48 hours to minimise potential of survival of parasites.  Scats will then be washed over a series of sieves and retained material allowed to dry before sorting into the major groups of interest – fur, bones, teeth, reptile skin and scales, feathers, plant material and invertebrates.  </p>
<p>The percentage of occurrence of each category of prey and total number of prey items will be recorded seasonally.  This will be compared with results from the seasonal availability prey for each category of prey (below).  Ideally this will be in a “resource selection” framework.</p>
<p><strong><em>Native fauna monitoring</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Survivorship monitoring of indicator species</em></strong></p>
<p>Woylie survivorship and population modeling (de Tores_ et al._, in prep-a) showed the previously translocated woylie populations are unlikely to have established self sustaining populations.  However, some individuals and/or populations may have persisted.  Initially, a one-off trapping program will be carried out at sites at and near the original Operation Foxglove translocation release sites within the current study area (Fig 1) and subsequently more widely within the study area.  Any trapped woylies will be fitted with movement sensitive mortality transmitters.  Subject to developmental work and trials, woylies will subsequently be fitted with contact/proximity collars.  Survivorship will be monitored weekly.  Monitoring emphasis will be on determining the predator responsible for mortality events attributed to predation.  Subject to the number of woylies trapped and incorporated into monitored sample, monitoring will also assess the fate of all radio collared woylies, will re-assess survivorship probability and will model the probability of the population(s) becoming self sustaining under the new baiting regimes.</p>
<p>Translocation of the boodie, <em>Bettongia lesueur</em>, is proposed for both baited areas and the unbaited control.  The translocation and the number of boodies translocated is subject to CALM approval of a translocation proposal and, as per the seasonal trapping, will proceed subsequent to the treatment areas receiving their requisite number of baitings in the preceding 12 months.  Boodies will be fitted with contact/proximity collars and monitored weekly to assess survivorship.  The use of surgically implanted transmitters will also be investigated for sub-adult and juvenile boodies.  Data will be analysed to model the probability of the translocated individuals establishing self sustaining populations in the presence and absence of fox control.  Monitoring will also focus on determining the cause of any known mortality events, with particular emphasis on the extent of cat and fox predation pre and post implementing cat control (cat baiting) in the northern baited area.</p>
<p>Distribution, abundance and survivorship of monitored populations of the common brushtail possum, <em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>, in the northern jarrah forest was shown to be a function of multi-dimensional factors, and not simply a function of the level of fox control imposed (de Tores_ et al.<em>, in prep-b; de Tores</em> et al._, in prep-d).  However, survivorship of sub-adult and juvenile possums was not assessed.  Subject to securing a CRC PhD stipend, survivorship of the common brushtail possum will be assessed with emphasis on juvenile and sub-adult possums.  This is now achievable through use of recently refined breakaway collars.  Where possible, this technology will incorporate contact/proximity telemetry.  If deemed necessary, surgically implanted transmitters will be assessed for use in juvenile and sub-adult common brushtail possums.</p>
<p>Results of survivorship monitoring of radio-collared indicator species (woylies and/or boodies and/or possums) will be analysed through use of a set of a priori candidate models and model selection based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Burnham and Anderson, 2002) in “Program Mark” (White, 2001).  The set of <em>a priori</em> candidate models will be examined to determine the model(s) which best describe survivorship.  Candidate models will include variables on fox and cat abundance and abundance estimates of other predator and alternative prey species.  Candidate models will also include habitat and environmental variables.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Animal handling and marking</em></strong></p>
<p>All mammal species trapped (woylies, possums, chuditch – see post doctoral research component for the chuditch study) or translocated (boodies) and fitted with radio collars will be anaesthetised using isoflurane gas anaesthetic (delivered using a conventional Modified Bains small animal anaesthetic machine) when collars are fitted.</p>
<p>Species collared will be restrained in calico or hessian bags while being mask-induced using 5% isoflurane.  Once anaesthetised, animals will be placed on a heat pad and maintained on 1.5% isoflurane concentration and an oxygen flow rate of 1.5 litres/min.  Intubation is not necessary; however, endotracheal tubes and a laryngoscope will be available in case of emergency.  Once collaring processes are complete the isoflurane will be turned off and animals will be allowed to breathe pure oxygen for a few minutes until they start to regain consciousness.  They will then be returned to calico or hessian bags, put onto heat pads and allowed to recover in a quiet place.  They will be regularly checked until fully conscious.  </p>
<p>All animals captured and held for collaring will be processed during of capture/trap clearing.  Unless identified as being unsuitable for release, each animal will be released that evening.  </p>
<p>Each medium size mammal will also have a subcutaneously implanted passive transponder (Trovan<sup>®</sup> brand) for unique identification.   A reflective ear tag will also be applied to radio collared possums.  For radio collared animals, transponders and ear tags will be applied when the animal is under inhalation anaesthesia.  Transponders will be implanted subcutaneously between the shoulder blades.  </p>
<p>A small ear biopsy will be collected from each woylie, boodie, chuditch and possum captured for radio-collaring.  Biopsy samples will be stored for future genetic analyses.  With the exception of woylies (and possibly boodies) which have a marginal vein in the pinna, ear biopsies will be taken from the outer edge of the pinna when the animal is under inhalation anaesthesia.  Biopsies will use a 5mm biopsy punch, leaving a notch on the edge of the ear.  In the case of woylies, the ear biopsy will be taken from a more proximal part of the pinna.  Biopsy punches will be flame sterilised between uses, and the animal’s skin will be disinfected prior to taking of the biopsy sample.  Ear tissue samples will be stored in DMSO<sub>4</sub> until genetic analyses can be carried out.</p>
<p>Alternative marking techniques will be investigated for all varanids – toe clipping is unlikely to be used and use of transponders and bird banding techniques will be investigated for allocating a unique identifier to each animal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Seasonal and spatial availability of native prey species</em></strong></p>
<p>The study will establish native fauna trapping webs to assess the temporal and spatial availability of the suite of small and medium size mammal fauna, the reptile fauna and invertebrate fauna.  The latter is subject to securing a CRC PhD stipend.  The trapping webs will be configured in accordance DISTANCE sampling web design (Buckland_ et al.<em>, 2001; Lukacs</em> et al.<em>, 2005) to ensure data are suitable for analyses through DISTANCE (Thomas</em> et al._, 2005) and conventional mark-recapture techniques (Burnham and Anderson, 2002; White, 2001).  These trapping webs will each be approximately 3.8ha in area, will incorporate wire cage, Elliott and vertebrate pitfall traps and will representatively sample the major habitat units within each of the baited treatments and the unbaited control.  Trapping will be conducted seasonally to determine the spatial and seasonal variation in the suite of prey species.  Seasonal trapping will commence once the treatment areas have received their requisite number of baitings in the preceding 12 months.</p>
<p><strong><em>Monitoring of pythons</em></strong></p>
<p>The south-west carpet python, <em>Morelia spilota imbricata</em>, is recognised as a threatened species.  The ecology of Western Australian wheatbelt and insular populations has been studied (Pearson, 2002) and a wealth of information exists on these populations.  However, populations from jarrah forest are poorly understood.  Predation by the carpet python has also recently been linked to the lack of success of translocation programs of the threatened arboreal mammal species, <em>Pseudocheirus occidentalis</em>, at coastal sites in the south-west of Western Australia (de Tores, 2005; de Tores_ et al.<em>, 2005a; de Tores</em> et al._, 2005b).  In collaboration with Murdoch University, CALM has commenced a PhD program studying various aspects of the ecology of the south-west carpet python.  This PhD program will assess the carpet python’s response, in a spatial context, to broadscale and localised introduced predator control (fox baiting programs) and will determine the role and importance of this ambush predator to translocation outcomes.  The program will also determine if there is a mesopredator release response by the south-west carpet python in the presence of fox control.  A sample size of approximately 10-15 radio-tagged (implanted) pythons is envisaged in the northern jarrah forest with an equivalent sample size at coastal sites.  The implanted transmitters (Holohil Systems) will incorporate temperature sensitive circuitry to provide information on seasonal variation in activity patterns.  Pythons implanted will be those known to have preyed on native species, as detected through monitoring of those species, and opportunistically collected pythons.  Monitoring will assess the frequency of prey species taken by pythons through periodic recapture of pythons and assessment of regurgitated gut contents and scat contents.  A broad range of data will also be collected on refuge and habitat use in the presence and absence of fox control.</p>
<p>This component of the project will also assess relationships between micro- and macro-habitat use, thermal biology (temperature regulation) in relation to microhabitat use and the influence of prey consumption, and prey distribution and abundance, to provide information for conservation strategies for this threatened species.  The work will also determine whether implanting a radio transmitter into pythons causes any infectious or inflammatory response by examining python haematology pre-and-post implantation of the radio transmitters.  Blood samples will be collected prior to, and following, implantation to enable assessment/detection of any infectious and/or inflammatory processes that may be caused by the implantation process. The thermal biology of the pythons will be monitored very closely post-implantation (using the heat-sensitive transmitters and a lazar temperature reader) for the following few days. Human patients will show signs of infection within 2-3 days post inoculation with increased body temperatures. </p>
<p>The study will also examine the genetic variation of carpet pythons within the northern jarrah forest.  This will allow baseline genetic data to be established. It will be valuable to conservation mangers to assess if populations are diverging genetically as increasing habitat loss may not be allowing sufficient genetic flow between populations. Genetic data will also be useful for people managing reptiles as pets, where captive bred reptiles are genetically monitored and illegal taking of pythons from the wild can be traced more effectively. The genetic information will be analysed through a collaborative effort with geneticists at Murdoch University. Measurements of genetic variation within the python population will involve scoring the presence or absence of attributes (genes or genetically determined morphological features) in the individuals, then extrapolating to arrive at estimates of the relative frequency of the attributes in the population (Lindenmayer and Burgman, 2005). </p>
<p>Capture marking and identification of study animals</p>
<p>Pythons will be captured in the following ways:</p>
<p>(a) Pythons found (through the above radio telemetry monitoring of native prey speies) to have preyed upon native species, will be captured and held for inclusion in the python ecology component of the research.  Pythons collected as a result of known predation events will be temporarily housed at the Dwellingup Research Centre until such time as the remains of the prey is regurgitated with the collar, or the collar is passed in a scat.  Alternatively, if the collar is not regurgitated or passed, once it is deemed that all prey has been digested and all faecal matter naturally passed, the python will be physically massaged to encourage it to regurgitate the radio collar. </p>
<p>(b) Attempts will be made to capture all pythons opportunistically sighted within the northern jarrah forest.  These captures will most likely be a result of sightings at night when driving, during summer (when pythons are most active and may cross roads more often) and sightings by the research team and/or District CALM employees.  Guidance and approval from CALM’s Nature Protection Branch will be sought when developing protocols for CALM employees to opportunistically collect pythons that they find within the study areas. </p>
<p>Opportunistically caught pythons will be physically restrained using conventional methods for handling snakes (pythons will be collected with care using either or a combination of conventional ‘head-grab’ behind the quadrate bone and the use of specialised snake hook and metal rimmed rounded calico bag). Following capture the pythons will be placed into a Hessian or calico bag to be transported to the Dwellingup Research Centre for the procedures documented below.</p>
<p>Each python will be individually marked by scale marking as described by Pearson (2002), however, use of Trovan<sup>®</sup> inert passive transponders will be also be investigated as an alternative identification technique.  The south-west carpet python is known to be able to “pass” surgically implanted transmitters (Pearson, 2002) and this phenomenon may make use of transponders ineffective.</p>
<p>Radio telemetry and transmitter implantation</p>
<p>The monitored sample size will be determined by the number of known predation events of native prey species, however a sample of 10 to 15 pythons is envisaged from the northern jarrah forest (exclusive of an approximate equal number of pythons monitored in the concurrent research at the western ringtail possum translocation sites).   Sterile radio transmitters will be surgically implanted into the abdominal cavity of each python. Different types (four sizes) of the temperature-sensitive radio transmitters (Holohil Systems Ltd., Canada) will be used depending on the size of the python.  All transmitters will be &lt;5% of the python’s body mass.  Aerials will be encased in 2mm non-toxic Silastic® tubing and the entire unit sealed with 734 flowable sealant (Dow Corning Corporation).  The battery cell life of each transmitter package used will vary depending upon the size of the snake to be implanted (larger pythons can be implanted with a larger battery cell/transmitter package).  Smaller cell/transmitter packages (3 or 5 g) will last for approximately 28 and 35 weeks respectively, whereas, the larger cell/transmitter packages (13 or 21 g) will last between 18-24 months.</p>
<p>Transmitters will be calibrated using a waterbath and circulating heater (Thermoline, Australia) against a certified mercury bulb thermometer (±0.1ºC). Temperature will be increased by 5ºC increments from 0-40 ºC. The period between pulses will be recorded using a Period/PPM meter (Titley Electronics, Australia) together with the time taken to hear 10 pulses using a stopwatch. The former measure is used for calculating body temperature from an automated telemetry system and the latter for data collected during fieldwork. Body temperatures of the pythons will be determined by applying third-order polynomial equations derived from calibration data. Transmitters will be calibrated following removal from the pythons to ensure there has not been significant drift in calibration. </p>
<p>Pythons will be anaesthetised using Isoflurane (“Forthane”, Abbott Pty. Ltd.) gas anaesthesia, intubated and with intermittent positive pressure ventilation used to induce and maintain the anaesthesia. Once under anaesthesia, each python will be given an intra-muscular injection of Ceftazidime 20mg/kg, which is a long-acting antibiotic used to prevent peri-operative infection. While maintaining each python under anaesthesia, surgical implantation of the radio transmitters will be achieved using an aseptic technique into the peritoneum through a mid-lateral incision 10% of the snake’s snout-vent-length (SVL) anterior to the vent. Absorbable sutures will be used to close the incision. Once the python shows signs of recovery from the anaesthetic procedure they will be given an intra-muscular injection of Butorphanol at 0.5 mg/kg. Butorphanol is an analgesic agent and is thought to provide pain relief for up to approximately 4 hours in reptiles. It has a slight sedative effect so the snakes will be maintained in a warm, quiet environment for one-three nights following the surgery and then released to point of capture. The administration of Butorphanol is important for initial post-operative pain relief. Further medication for pain relief is not warranted since the surgery is a relatively simple procedure that does not involve incision through muscle, organs or bone. During anaesthesia, standard morphometric data will be recorded. Pythons that have been implanted will be followed using radio telemetry for the duration of the study period. When possible, pythons will be recaptured close to the end of battery life of the transmitter and removed or replaced if necessary. </p>
<p>Study pythons will be tracked on a week-to-fortnight basis over the study duration. Pythons will be tracked on foot using a 3-element yagi aerial (Sirtrak Ltd., New Zealand) and receiver (RX3, Biotelemetry Services, Australia). The exact position of the pythons will be determined using a differential GPS system (post-processing using Thales MobileMapper software). Previous studies suggest that most pythons do not typically flee when approached by researchers in the field (Pearson, 2002). Therefore, behaviour, posture, proportion of body in sun, cloud cover and aspects of micro- and macro-habitat use will be recorded. Temperature recordings will be taken to gain information on microhabitat use and thermal regulation of the pythons. Temperature recordings will be taken to assess the various insulator capabilities of microhabitats and thermoregulation of pythons, quantified with data loggers.  This aspect will investigate different options for data logging information including implanted data loggers (encased within the implanted vhf radio transmitter) and stand-alone loggers to record physiological and immediate microhabitat environmental data.</p>
<p>Dietary analysis</p>
<p>Pythons collected for implantation of radio transmitters will be held for brief periods (1-2 days) for dietary analysis, including analysis of diet in relation to body size (the south-west carpet python shows strong body size sexual dimorphism (Pearson, 2002)).  Captive held pythons that have recently consumed prey will be palpated to obtain regurgitated and faecal material (this will occur also to ensure pythons have an empty stomach prior to anaesthesia).  Additional collection of faecal and regurgitated material for analysis will occur in the field through the radio telemetry study. This will limit the time spent in contact with, and limit/negate time spent in captivity for the python. Collection for dietary analysis will most likely be made on a bimonthly basis for each study animal. Limited additional collection of regurgitated material will occur opportunistically, where there is clear evidence (bulge in python) that there is recently obtained prey. </p>
<p>The results from the dietary analysis will be compared with the seasonal availability of prey (see above) and analyses will examine whether any species is preferentially selected as a prey item.</p>
<p>Haematology</p>
<p>When pythons are anaesthetised (to implant transmitter) a blood sample will be collected from the ventral midline, prior to and post implantation. The serum collected will be used to undertake haematology analysis. The haematology testing will enable the detection of any infectious and/or inflammatory response to the radio transmitter being implanted. Without haematology testing, information on the health status of the study python may otherwise go undetected by basic visual examination.</p>
<p>Telemetry data</p>

","The following has been extracted from the 2005 translocation proposal (de Tores, 2005), the 2004/2005 Science Division Activity Report, the publication prepared for the 2003 review of western shield (de Tores_ et al._, 2004), two popular press publications (de Tores_ et al._, 2005a; de Tores_ et al._, 2005c) and amended and updated where necessary:

 

 

 

Background  -  Distribution and conservation status

 

At the time of European settlement, the western ringtail possum, _Pseudocheirus occidentalis_, had a distribution which encompassed the south-west of Western Australia and extended from north of Jurien, to the south-west of Western Australia and east to the Esperance Plain (de Tores, in prep).  As recently as the 1970s the distribution included Wheatbelt areas near Pingelly (de Tores, in prep; Jones_ et al._, 1994).  Although there are recent unconfirmed reports of western ringtail possum presence from the Pingelly area, from Sawyers Valley/Mundaring and from the Darling Scarp near Jarrahdale, the distribution is now thought to have contracted to the south-west corner of Western Australia, with the most northerly confirmed record of occurrence (exclusive of translocated populations) in jarrah/marri forest and peppermint riverine habitat northeast of Harvey (de Tores, in prep).

 

The recent review of distribution and conservation status (de Tores, in prep) found the western ringtail possum met the IUCN (World Conservation Union) criteria (IUCN, 2001) for listing as a threatened species in the sub-category “Vulnerable”. 

 

History of previous western ringtail possum translocations

 

Despite being listed as a “threatened” species, the western ringtail possum is locally common in the Busselton area of south-west Western Australia.  Orphaned, injured and “nuisance” western ringtail possums are regularly brought into care and nurtured and/or rehabilitated by wildlife carers.  Historically, when the wildlife carers decided these possums were suitable for release, the animals were “provided” to the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) and released as part of a translocation and monitoring program.  Many were not “provided” to CALM and were released, and continue to be released, in an _ad-hoc_ un-monitored manner.  The latter has not been sanctioned by CALM.  The pre-release health and disease status and subsequent fate of these released animals are unknown.

 

In the Busselton area in particular, local and State Government approved developments have resulted in fragmentation and removal/destruction of western ringtail possum habitat.  Resident populations of western ringtail possums are regularly displaced as a result of this habitat fragmentation and habitat loss.  If unchecked, this habitat fragmentation will present a major threat to the western ringtail possum.

 

Existing known threats to the species include (de Tores, in prep; Wayne_ et al._, 2000):

 

·                population fragmentation through urbanisation and development in the Busselton, Bunbury and Albany areas;

 

·                predation from introduced predators;

 

·                increased predation in the presence of timber harvesting operations; and

 

·                climate change.

 

Translocation has been adopted as a management strategy to mitigate the effects from habitat clearing.  However, results from translocation have been equivocal.  Translocations of the western ringtail possum have been carried out by CALM since 1991.  A total of 381 western ringtail possums was translocated to four release sites in the period 1991 to 2001.

 

Of these, 106 rehabilitated possums, ex wildlife carers, were released at Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park in the period from 1991 to 1997; 142 were sourced directly from the wild (development sites, where habitat was destroyed), and released at Yalgorup National Park (two sites) in the period 1995 to 2001; and 133 were rehabilitated possums, ex wildlife carers, released at Lane Poole Reserve/Keats forest Block in the period 1996 to 1999 (various unpublished data).  The total number of translocated possums is thought to represent only a relatively small proportion of the number of western ringtail possums relocated, as many more rehabilitated ringtails have been released by wildlife carers as part of unsanctioned and un-monitored translocations.

 

All CALM sanctioned translocations were to release sites baited for fox control (dried meat baits impregnated with the toxin sodium monofluroacetate, or 1080).  All sites were monitored as funds permitted.

 

Each release site has shown some level of translocation success.  However, the full criteria for translocation success have not been met at any site.   Monitoring results from the primary release site, Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park, confirmed this population declined to a level where extensive survey effort was required to confirm western ringtail possum presence (de Tores_ et al._, 2004).

 

Changes to the 1080 baiting regime, specifically lapses in the baiting effort, a reduction in the number of baits delivered and a change to burying the baits, was proposed as the most parsimonious explanation for the decline at Leschenault (de Tores_ et al._, 2004; de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  However, fauna declines are unlikely to be the result of a single dimensional causal factor, such as predation (de Tores, in prep) and this no doubt also applies to translocation failure.  Alternative hypotheses proposed as possible causes for the translocation failure at Leschenault include competition with the common brushtail possum, _Trichosurus vulpecula_, predation by cats and/or chuditch and/or pythons, drought, unsuitable habitat, wildlife health related issues, presence of disease (toxoplasmosis has been confirmed in the ringtail population at Yalgorup) and prey switching (rabbit control has been conducted concurrently with fox control at Leschenault and has resulted in an observed, but unquantified, decline in rabbit abundance.  With this decline there is the possibility of prey switching by the suite of introduced and native predators and the potential for increased levels of predation on the western ringtail possum) (de Tores and Rosier, in prep).

 

_Post-hoc_ analyses using DISTANCE sampling techniques (Buckland_ et al._, 2001; Thomas_ et al._, 2002) of data from spotlight transects at Leschenault (1996 - 1998 and 2002) and Yalgorup (2002) identified increases in brushtail possum and western ringtail possum density at Leschenault in 1996-1998, and an additional, but small increase in density in brushtail possums in the period 1998-2002 (the period when the western ringtail possum declined at Leschenault) (de Tores_ et al._, 2004; de Tores and Rosier, in prep; de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  Further analyses also indicated partitioning of the nocturnal foraging habitat by the two species .  These results combined, suggested competition with the brushtail possum alone was unlikely to have been responsible for the western ringtail possum decline at Leschenault (de Tores_ et al._, 2004).

 

Additional translocations of displaced western ringtail possums have taken place in 2004.  These translocations have been necessitated by the requirement to relocate western ringtail possums displaced by developments which have removed western ringtail possum habitat.  The releases were at Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park (where monthly baiting was re-instated) and an unbaited control site established within Yalgorup National Park.

 

A subset of 37 of the 100 western ringtail possums released at Leschenault since January 2004 has been radio-collared and monitored.  Interim results have demonstrated a higher rate of predation-caused mortality at the baited site.  At 1 June 2006, there had been 11 mortality events attributed to predation by pythons, 10 attributed to predation by cats, 3 attributed to predation by a fox/cat? and 1 attributed to predation by fox.  33 of the 55 released ringtail possums at the unbaited Yalgorup site since January 2004 have been radio-collared and there have been only 5 known predation events, 1 attributed to a raptor and 1 to a fox, 2 to a fox? and 1 to a cat.  The results suggest a pattern of increasing predation events by cats and pythons in the presence of fox control.  This is consistent with the concept of mesopredator release.

 

Disease/wildlife health

 

Disease is often overlooked as a potential agent of population decline (Caughley and Gunn, 1996) and infectious diseases can result in significant declines of wildlife at the local population level and at the species level (Caughley and Gunn, 1996; Daszak and Cunningham, 1999; Spielman, 2001).  Disease poses an additional threat to wildlife populations already at risk from threatening processes and in some situations may be the final factor responsible for driving a species to extinction.  

 

In particular, introduced diseases can have a detrimental effect on naïve wildlife populations when trans-species infections occur from infected reservoir hosts.  Wildlife species known to have suffered significant population declines associated with infectious diseases include African buffalos (_Syncerus caffer_), black-footed ferrets, _Mustela nigripes,_ (canine distemper virus); the heath hen , _Tymphanuchus cupido cupido_ (by blackhead), the Indian wild ass, _Equus hemionus khur_ (by surra and African horse sickness), amphibian species (chytridiomycosis); lions, _Pantera Leo_, (canine distemper virus); and African wild dogs, _Lycaon pictus_, (rabies, canine distemper virus) (Caughley and Gunn, 1996; Daszak and Cunningham, 1999; Daszak_ et al._, 2000). 

 

There are potentially significant disease risks associated with wildlife translocation programs. Woodford and Rossiter (1994) outlined the disease risks which should be considered by conservation managers when undertaking a translocation project.  The risks for each translocation project will vary depending on the type of animal and epidemiological situations at the founding source location and release destination (Woodford and Rossiter, 1994).  Capture, transport and quarantine are stressful events for wild animals and stress in such animals can result in immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to infection and recrudescence of latent disease (Woodford and Rossiter, 1994). 

 

There are two aspects of disease transmission which must be considered for translocation projects.  Conservation managers must ensure the wildlife species being translocated, especially those originating from captivity, do not introduce novel pathogens to naïve populations of wildlife at the release site (Warren_ et al._, 2003; Woodford and Rossiter, 1994).  Conversely, they also need to be aware that resident native and introduced animals inhabiting the release site may carry pathogens to which the released animals have had no previous exposure.  Infection with such pathogens could adversely affect the survival of the released animals (Woodford and Rossiter, 1994).

 

Issues

 

The ongoing requirement to clear land for housing and industry in the greater Busselton area will continue to result in habitat loss and displacement of resident populations of the western ringtail possum.  There will be a continued need for land use planners and wildlife managers to address the conservation management issues associated with this habitat loss.  Although translocation has been identified as a possible management option for displaced and rehabilitated western ringtail possums, translocations are yet to be shown to result in sustainable populations at the release sites.

 

Monitoring of translocations to date has been opportunistic (i.e. as funds permitted) and has lacked a strategic approach whereby the suite of factors potentially limiting translocation success can be objectively assessed.  Although there are sufficient published data to suggest the western ringtail possum is highly susceptible to predation by foxes (see for example Augee_ et al._, 1996), the importance of other factors in terms of translocation success has not been determined.  Specifically:

 

(1)          There are no base-line data on the disease status of western ringtail possum populations in the wild.  During previous translocation procedures the pre-release health status was not assessed.  There was no identification or investigation of any disease conditions resulting from holding rehabilitated possums “in care” for short or extended periods.  There has been no comparison of survivorship and long-term health status of rehabilitated possums and possums translocated directly from the wild.

 

(2)          Toxoplasmosis was identified on post-mortem examination of a ringtail possum recruited to the translocated population at Yalgorup National Park (de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  The animal showed neurological signs following routine capture for radio collar replacement.  The possum was not released due to its clinical condition and was taken into captivity for care.  It failed to respond or show any evidence of recovery.  It was subsequently euthanased and the presence of Toxoplasmosis confirmed (de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  The prevalence of toxoplasmosis in ringtail possums in Yalgorup National Park and the other release sites remains unknown.  The prevalence of toxoplasmosis in feral cat populations (host) at each of the release sites is unknown.

 

(3)          The influence of the suite of site specific habitat factors has not been assessed.

 

(4)          The effect of competition, should it exist, between the western ringtail possum and the common brushtail has not been rigorously assessed.

 

(5)          Predation of western ringtail possums by pythons, _Morelia spilota imbricata_, has now been confirmed at the Leschenault Peninsula release site.  It is unclear if these predation events are a result of site specific factors, increased python abundance resulting from a reduced level of predation by foxes, increased python abundance and different use of the landscape resulting from a mesopredator release effect, learned behaviour, or seasonal predation patterns.  Similarly, it is not known if on-going predation by pythons, should it occur, will jeopardise translocation success, or if these effects can be ameliorated by the timing of translocation releases.

 

(6)          The potential for cat populations to increase in the presence of fox control (mesopredator release) has not been assessed.  Anecdotal accounts have reported such increases, however, no unequivocal data are available to support this assertion.  Even if such changes in cat abundance do occur, these changes cannot be assumed to equate with an increase in the net level of predation of the translocated species, or other _in-situ_ species.

 

(7)          There are no data available from this study, or other translocation studies, to differentiate between individual animals responsible for predation events.  The frequency of predation events of western ringtail possums at the Leschenault Peninsula release site since January 2004, combined with the spatial pattern of the retrieved carcasses and the nature of the predation events (i.e. predation attributed to a cat) suggests many of the mortality events attributed to predation by cats, may be the result of predation by one cat.  If this is the case, it provides managers with a very different long-term problem from that posed by an increased rate of predation resulting from an increase in cat abundance.

 

(8)          Wildlife carer records for the ten year period 1994 to 2003 revealed an average of 123 western ringtail possums per year had been handled by one carer alone.  Only a small proportion of these animals has been passed on to CALM for release as part of the formal release programs at Leschenault, Yalgorup and Lane Poole Reserve.  This suggests there is a very large number of ringtails “passing through” the wildlife carer network and released in unsanctioned translocations.  The fate of these animals is unknown.  The conservation value of releasing animals, post rehabilitation and/or post being held in care for other reasons, can only be assessed if releases are monitored.

 

(9)          The genetic structure of wild populations of the western ringtail possum is unknown.  Specifically, there is no information on mating systems, population sizes, gene flow and the effect of population and habitat fragmentation.  Similarly, the genetic structure of the founding stock used for translocations and the genetic structure of the establishing populations at translocation release sites are not known.

 

The translocation  -  General

 

The release and monitoring program is proposed to build on the results from previous translocations to Leschenault Peninsula Conservation Park and Yalgorup National Park (de Tores_ et al._, 2004; de Tores and Rosier, in prep; de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-a).  Translocation releases and monitoring re-commenced in 2004.  These translocations were sanctioned under interim approval from the Department of Conservation and Land Management and were deemed necessary as a result of habitat destruction from developments in the Busselton area.

 

138 western ringtail possums were relocated from three development sites in the period 13 January to 17 July 2004, with an additional 17 rehabilitated ringtails, ex wildlife carers, released in August 2004.  Capture, relocation and monitoring of these displaced and rehabilitated ringtails has been undertaken on an _ad-hoc_ basis as funds permitted.  The continuity and intensity of monitoring was again determined by the amount of funds available from developers.

 

Translocations and longer-term monitoring are now proposed through an integrated program structured in an active adaptive management framework, whereby monitoring (performance evaluation in a research context) is used to trigger changes to management (Possingham, 2001).  If sufficiently funded, monitoring will address the issues of mesopredator release and intraguild predation.  Mesopredator release is defined as an increase in the abundance of subordinate predators following the removal of a dominant predator which previously held the subordinate species in check (Soule_ et al._, 1988). Such an occurrence may constitute one link in a larger trophic cascade.  Intraguild predation is a combination of competition and predation and is the killing of one species by another species where both species use similar, often limiting, resources (Polis_ et al._, 1989).  It is different from “classical predation” as the act of intraguild predation reduces potential exploitation competition (Polis_ et al._, 1989).

 

The translocation program (de Tores, 2005) is innovative as it advocates development and use of novel “contact” telemetry for monitoring of predator and prey species.  The use of contact telemetry will also enable examination of the issues of mesopredator release and intraguild predation.  Contact telemetry utilises a technology whereby a data logger is incorporated into the radio-tag circuitry.  The data logger records when two tags (radio-collars) come in contact with, or are within close proximity of, each other and records the identity of the two tags (i.e. the two individual animals) in contact.  The data logger also records the time of the contact event.  For example, when a western ringtail possum (wrp1) is in contact with a radio-tagged cat (cat1), the contact event is recorded and the data is downloaded when the tag is subsequently recovered.  The data recorded by the data logger of “wrp1’s” tag include the specific ID of “cat1” and the exact timing of the contact event.  The corresponding information is recorded by the data logger in “cat1’s” tag.  Adoption of this technology will enable collection of detailed information on intraguild predation (i.e. it will enable detection of predation of cats by foxes, should it occur), on inter-specific competition (i.e. it will enable detection of cats and foxes coming into close proximity, similarly it will enable detection of ringtails and brushtails coming into close proximity) and will allow identification of the species and the individual responsible for each predation event.

 

The technology is currently advanced to a state where contact circuitry can be incorporated into collars of a weight suitable for fitting to foxes and cats.  However, pen/aviary enclosure trials are required to ensure the technology can be used on animals as small as western ringtail possums.  Ethics Committee approval has recently been given to trial these collars on western ringtail possums and common brushtail possums.  These trials will also enable assessment and adjustment of the “contact” distance, i.e. the distance between the collars required to activate “contact” mode.  The contact telemetry collars proposed for trial do not currently incorporate mortality circuitry.  Further development is required to re-instate mortality circuitry, without the collars becoming too heavy for use on the western ringtail possum.  Similarly, the option of incorporating the time of activating mortality mode into the data logger is being examined.

 

Development work is also being carried out by the collar manufacturers to determine whether contact telemetry can be downloaded remotely from satellite collars.  If this is able to be achieved, cats and foxes will be fitted with satellite collars incorporating contact circuitry.  The use of satellite telemetry will not only provide a more reliable data collection mechanism for contact events involving foxes and cats, but will provide a more cost effective mechanism for collection of fox and cat location records.  The accepted alternatives (triangulation from various ground locations and/or use of towers) are inherently difficult logistically and require an extensive commitment of field time with a lower level of precision and reliability.

 

The satellite telemetry data on fox and cat movement will also complement the mesopredator release research proposed at a landscape level (de Tores_ et al._, 2005b).  This work will incorporate to use of satellite telemetry to examine mesopredator release within the northern jarrah forest of Western Australia.  Specifically, the work will examine the extent of cat movements in the presence and absence of fox control.  The research will examine, _inter alia_, whether the pattern of use of the landscape by cats changes when fox control is implemented over large areas.  This has ramifications for CALM’s Western Shield program, specifically for translocation programs planned for large tracts of land where fox baiting has been/will be implemented.  The western ringtail possum translocation research will complement this large scale mesopredator release research by examining the same issues at a smaller scale, i.e. at smaller habitat patches in the presence and absence of fox control.  These smaller patches are representative of many of CALM’s translocation release sites in the south-west of Western Australia.

 

The western ringtail possum translocation program (de Tores, 2005) also proposes to introduce a system whereby wildlife carers are required to notify the Department of Conservation and Land Management within 72 hours of a western ringtail possum being taken into care.  A similar system is in place for several other species (Peter Mawson, pers. comm.).  Under this proposal, wildlife carers will be required to ensure all western ringtail possums suitable for release (as determined by health screening protocols outlined in this proposal) are released in accordance with the translocation and monitoring protocols of this program and only at sites identified in this proposal.

 

It is further proposed to ensure all proponents of development proposals are aware of their requirement to seek approval from the Federal Environment Minister where the proposed development _“has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance”_ (Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, 1999 – EPBC Act).  The EPBC Act defines _“matters of national environmental significance”_ to include proposals which may have an impact on listed threatened species.  Translocations from development sites will only be undertaken where the development proponent has sought and been given translocation approval from the Commonwealth of Australia, consistent with the EPBC Act, or where the Commonwealth has deemed such approval is not required.

London, pp. 178-198.</p>","<p>1) General methodology</p>
<p>Rehabilitated and displaced western ringtail possums will be translocated to the five translocation sites above (see Section 5(d)).  Animals will be sourced from wildlife carers and from development sites.  Rehabilitated possums residing with carers in Busselton will be translocated once deemed healthy and suitable for release.  Numbers of translocated possums sourced from carers may be in the order of 100 per year.  Timing of translocation events and the total number translocated will be dictated by the number of western ringtail possums made available by carers and by development activities in Busselton.  </p>
<p>A subset of animals from each source will be “health screened’ and radio-collared prior to release (10 animals per study site).  These animals will comprise the main radio collared study population for the duration of the research project.  To maintain the study sample size, any deaths will be replaced with new animals (i.e. subsequent releases and/or recruits to the population).</p>
<p>Rehabilitated animals coming out of care will be “health screened” and returned to care for two weeks prior to collaring and release.  This will enable results from the “health screening” to be reviewed and interpreted prior to release and will ensure there are no clinical contraindications for release into the translocated population.  Ringtails captured from development sites will not be held in care after screening.  Release of these animals will occur immediately after capture and screening.  The health screening and radio-collaring processes are described in detail in the section on Specific Procedures below.</p>
<p>All translocated animals will be identified by means of subcutaneous passive transponders (Trovan<sup>®</sup>) and fitted with a reflective ear tag (right ear for females, left ear for males) to enable visual differentiation between translocated animals and recruits to the population.  Ear biopsies for future genetic population studies will also be taken.  These procedures will be undertaken under gas inhalation anaesthesia (see Specific Procedures below).</p>
<p>Radio-collared animals released into the five translocation release sites will be monitored weekly.  Radio collars used will incorporate movement sensitive mortality circuitry and monitoring will entail: (a) checking that the animals are alive, (b) locating any that die and determining cause of death and (c) locating and marking diurnal rest sites and nocturnal foraging locations.  </p>
<p>Western ringtail possums that die will be located (by radio-tracking), and the cause of death determined if possible (fox, cat, chuditch or python predation; other cause).  Carcasses will be autopsied if sufficiently intact.  Radio-collars will be retrieved for re-powering and re-use and the site at which the animal died will be searched for indications of predator identity (scats, teeth marks, burial method, presence of python etc).  </p>
<p>Weekly radio-tracking will alternate between day-time and night-time.  Rest sites and foraging locations will be marked using flagging tape, and differentially corrected GPS coordinates recorded.  Home range sizes, overlaps between individuals and species, and habitat use will be analysed using GIS techniques (ArcGIS 9) (ESRI, 1999-2004) and Ranges 6 home range software (Kenward_ et al._, 2003).  Radio-tracking will also enable determination of recruitment levels through visualisation of dependent offspring during nocturnal tracking sessions.   </p>
<p>Brushtail possums already resident in the study sites will be captured using wire cage traps (a minimum sample size of 5 common brushtail possums per study site), anaesthetised, health screened and radio-collared (see Specific Procedures below for details).  Radio-tracking of these animals will be carried out weekly as for the western ringtail possums to provide data for comparison of habitat use and foraging range and to determine likely levels of inter-specific competition (spatial analysis using GIS).  </p>
<p>Predation of western ringtail possums by carpet pythons will be investigated in collaboration with the PhD project examining the ecology and diet of the carpet python (see below).  Frequency of python predation rates will be analysed and any pythons ingesting collared western ringtail possums will be captured for inclusion in the python project.  </p>
<p>Interactions between individual possums of both species and between possums and predators will be investigated through the use of contact telemetry in collaboration with the study on fox/cat interactions (subject to development of this to a stage where the technology can be use on the western ringtail possum) (see below also).  Contact telemetry technology is currently under development and is unlikely to be used on western ringtail possums until the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> year of the project.  </p>
<p>Fox baiting will take place at three of the five study sites (see tables in the Specific Procedures section below).  Survivorship and rates of predation will be compared between sites to determine whether fox baiting has a positive, negative or neutral effect on survivorship of translocated western ringtail possum populations.  </p>
<p>Spotlighting transects will be carried out in each of the study sites towards the beginning of the project to ascertain numbers of western ringtail and brushtail possums present in the sites prior to introduction of newly translocated animals.  Western ringtail possums from previous translocation efforts are likely to be present at low density in all sites except site 5.  These spotlighting transects will be repeated annually to determine whether population numbers are increasing, decreasing or remaining stable as time progresses.  Recruits to the western ringtail population will be identifiable due to the lack of reflective ear tags. Transects will be designed to include representative structural habitat categories for each site so that possum density estimates can be stratified on the basis of habitat variables (see section on Analytical Techniques below).   Transect lines will be marked by reflective tape on jarrah stakes and will be walked over several consecutive nights using hand-held 35W spotlights to detect eye shine.  </p>
<p>Habitat categories will be delineated, following ground-truthing of digital data, on the basis of floristics and structural vegetation units as previously mapped by Trudgen (1984).  A suite of habitat variables will also be monitored during radio-tracking activities.  These will include aspects of individual trees in which possums are resting or foraging (species, height, proximity to other vegetation, types of rest site, possum position within tree) and landform variables such as aspect, and slope.  </p>
<p>Data on environmental and climactic conditions will be collected throughout the duration of the project to provide covariates for statistical analyses of habitat use and survivorship.  Rainfall, temperature and humidity data will be obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology, and data on soil type and nutrient status of vegetation obtained through collaboration with projects examining Tuart decline in the region.  </p>
<p>2) Specific Handling Procedures</p>
<p><em>a) Capture and holding</em></p>
<p>Western ringtail possums will be captured at development sites using a dart gun (de Tores_ et al._, unpublished) and the intramuscular anaesthetic, Zoletil.  Possums will be transported and held captive within calico bags inside boxes with heat pads for warmth.  Rehabilitated western ringtail possums residing with carers are similarly transported in calico bags but not anaesthetised until health screened or collared.</p>
<p>Brushtail possums will be trapped (conventional “Sheffield” wire cage traps) at the translocation sites and transported to the field station in hessian bags.  Field stations used will be at Busselton (western ringtail possums) and Preston Beach (brushtail possums and western ringtail possum recruits and previously released western ringtail possums re-captured for radio-collar replacement).  </p>
<p><em>b) Anaesthesia</em></p>
<p>Possums of both species will be anaesthetised using isoflurane gas anaesthetic (delivered using a conventional Modified Bains small animal anaesthetic machine) for all health screening and radio-collaring activities.</p>
<p>Possums will be restrained in calico bags whilst being mask-induced using 5% isoflurane.  Once anaesthetised, animals will be placed on a heat pad and maintained on 1.5% isoflurane concentration and an oxygen flow rate of 1.5 litres/min.  Intubation is not necessary; however, endotracheal tubes and a laryngoscope will be available in case of emergency.  Once screening and collaring processes are complete the isoflurane will be turned off and animals will be allowed to breathe pure oxygen for a few minutes until they start to regain consciousness. They will then be returned to calico bags, put onto heat pads and allowed to recover in a quiet place.  They will be regularly checked until fully conscious.  </p>
<p>All possums captured and held for screening and collaring will be processed during the day following the night of capture.  Unless identified as being unsuitable for release, possums displaced from development sites will be released the same evening as the health screening to ensure they have ample opportunity to forage.  Possums provided by carers will be returned to care or housed at the Fauna Rehabilitation Foundation, Malaga in the period post health screening and prior to availability of the results from the health screening.</p>
<p><em>c) Health screening: sites, numbers and rationale</em></p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Although western ringtail possums have previously been translocated into four of the five study sites that will be used for this project, translocation success has yet to be demonstrated. Reasons for the previous lack of demonstrated success are unclear.  Possible explanations include: competition with the common brushtail possum, increased predation by foxes, cats or pythons, prey switching, unsuitable habitat, climactic effects and disease.  The most parsimonious explanation is an increase in the level of fox predation as a result of changes to the 1080 baiting regime (de Tores_ et al._, 2004).  The influence of disease on translocation success is unknown and there is minimal information on levels of disease in the natural and translocated populations is presently available.  The current project aims to redress this knowledge deficit and to ascertain whether and how the presence of disease is likely to affect the outcome of western ringtail possum translocation programs.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>·       Determine baseline haematology and serum biochemistry values for western ringtail possums and brushtail possums, both in the Busselton region (western ringtails) and at translocation sites (western ringtails and brushtails). </p>
<p>·       Detect western ringtail possums with abnormal haematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis values, especially those coming out of care, to ensure that overtly unhealthy animals are not translocated.</p>
<p>·       Determine infection status and/or evidence of exposure to single-celled blood-borne parasitic diseases such as Toxoplasmosis, Leptospirosis and Cryptococcosis in western ringtail and brushtail possums, both in the Busselton region (western ringtails) and at translocation sites (western ringtails and brushtails). </p>
<p>·       Determine infection status and/or evidence of exposure to Chlamydia in western ringtail and brushtail possums, both in the Busselton region (western ringtails) and at translocation sites (western ringtails and brushtails). </p>
<p>·       Determine (both pre- and post-translocation) whether western ringtail and brushtail possums show evidence of infection by Ross River Virus, and thus whether they may act as reservoirs for this mosquito-transmitted disease.</p>
<p>·       Determine normal levels of infection by gastro-intestinal parasites and ectoparasites in western ringtail possums and brushtail possums, and detect ringtails with unusually heavy parasite burdens that might require treatment prior to translocation.</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>See Table 1 for numbers of animals to be screened at each site, and Table 2 for details of parameters to be screened.</p>
<p>Possums will be anaesthetised using inhalation anaesthesia (Isoflurane, as above) prior to sampling for health screening.  Blood will be taken from the lateral tail veins to a maximum of 5 ml blood per kg of animal.  Whole blood will be allowed to clot (after removal of 400µl for haematology) and then spun down to obtain serum for biochemistry and health screening (Toxoplasmosis, Leptospirosis, Cryptococcosis and Ross River Virus).  The bladder will be expressed to obtain a urine sample and the cloaca swabbed for microbiological screening.  Swabs will also be taken from the conjunctiva, pharynx and cloaca for Chlamydia screening. A faecal sample will be obtained opportunistically during the period that the animal is in captivity.  Samples will be analysed at Murdoch University (Veterinary Clinical Pathology laboratory) and also sent away for specific tests (Leptospirosis tests by Lee Smythe at the WHO/FAO/OIE Collaborating Centre for Reference &amp; Research on Leptospirosis in QLD, Cryptococcus tests by Mark Krockenberger at Sydney University, Chlamydia tests by Peter Timms at the Queensland University of Technology, Toxoplasmosis testing in Tasmania).  </p>

<p>Rationale:</p>
<p>General health screening (routine haematology, biochemistry, microbiology, and parasitology) of western ringtail possums prior to translocation will provide a measure of the general health status of animals at the time they are first introduced into the translocation sites.  Animals with overt signs of disease will not be translocated.  Comparison of initial screening values with results obtained 4-6 months after translocation will show whether the health status of animals changes, and whether there is evidence of exposure to disease post-translocation.  These results will help determine whether disease is a limiting factor in translocation success and whether sites vary in exposure rates to different diseases.  </p>
<p>Western ringtail possum disease screening (Toxoplasmosis, Leptospirosis, Cryptococcosis and Ross River Virus) will take place both prior to translocation to determine levels of disease in the natural population or evidence of infection whilst in care, and 4-6 months post-translocation to determine transmission rates of disease from other animals in the translocation sites to the newly introduced western ringtail possums.  Brushtail possums in the translocation sites will be screened to determine levels of disease in the natural population and the potential for transmission of diseases to translocated western ringtail possums that might not have been previously exposed to disease.</p>
<p>Results will be compared to those obtained from naturally occurring populations (see below) for the western ringtail and brushtail possums in the greater Busselton region to determine (a) whether diseases are likely to be transmitted into translocation sites via translocated western ringtails and (b) whether brushtail possums in the translocation sites are likely to infect western ringtail possums with diseases to which they have not previously been exposed. </p>
<p><em>d) Radio-telemetry</em></p>
<p>The major objectives of the radio telemetry work at the translocation release sites are to:</p>
<p>·           derive home ranges estimates (diurnal rest sites and nocturnal foraging locations) of translocated western ringtail possums and <em>in situ</em> populations of the brushtail possum to determine the extent of competition for food and resting habitat between the two possum species.</p>
<p>·           determine population densities of translocated western ringtail possums in the study sites, and migration of translocated animals following release at the sites.</p>
<p>·           determine survivorship and reproductive rates of translocated western ringtail possums in the months and years following release and derive estimates of population growth and stability or otherwise of the translocated western ringtail possum population.</p>
<p>·           investigate rates of predation of radio-collared animals and determine the predators responsible to explain observed survival/mortality rates.  This will be carried out in conjunction with other aspects of the larger project which is investigating mesopredator release and python ecology at the same study sites (see below). </p>
<p>·           use the newly developed contact telemetry to examine detailed interactions between individuals of various species (western ringtail and brushtail possums, pythons, cats, foxes and possibly chuditch).  </p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>See Table 3 for numbers of animals to be radio-collared at each site, and Table 4 for details of parameters to be monitored.  The adult animals used for radio-collar attachment will be the same individuals used for the health screening aspect of the project.</p>

<p>Both western ringtail and brushtail possums will be anaesthetised using inhalation anaesthesia (isoflurane) for the entire collaring process to minimise stress of handling.  Radio-collars used on western ringtail possums weigh approximately 15-17g, and those used on brushtail possums are slightly heavier.  Battery life of the collars is 4-6 months and 10-12 months for the ringtail and brushtail collars respectively.  Collars are carefully fitted to the anaesthetised animals, checking that they are neither too tight nor too loose.  Animals will be re-captured towards the end of the collar’s battery life for collar replacement.  This enables long-term monitoring of survival and reproduction of individual animals.  Removed collars will be sent back to the manufacturer for refurbishing and reused.</p>
<p>Juvenile or sub-adult western ringtail possums captured opportunistically from translocation sites (e.g. captured along with the mother when re-collaring the latter) will be radio-collared with specially developed breakaway collars that do not interfere adversely with animal growth (de Tores and Rosier, unpublished-b).  Monitoring of these animals will provide data on survivorship, dispersal and reproduction of recruits to the translocated population.  </p>

<p>Geographic positional data on possum resting and foraging locations obtained by radio-tracking will be imported into Ranges 6 (Kenward_ et al._, 2003) and ArcGIS (ESRI, 1999-2004) along with vegetation maps and analysed spatially to determine home ranges, dispersal patterns of animals and overlapping use of territories and foraging grounds.  </p>
<p><em>e) Application of ear tags, transponder implantation, ear biopsy</em></p>
<p>Small reflective ear tags will be applied to every translocated western ringtail possum, whether or not the animal is part of the radio-tracking and health screening program.  This will enable differentiation between translocated animals and new recruits to the population as time progresses.  Each translocated animal will also receive a subcutaneously implanted passive identification transponder (Trovan<sup>®</sup> brand).  These provide unique identification for ear-tagged animals that may later be captured or found dead, and enable an animal’s history to be traced through data records.  Ear tags and transponders will be applied under inhalation anaesthesia.  Ear tags will be applied to the left ear on male possums and the right ear on females.  Transponders will be implanted subcutaneously between the shoulder blades.  Brushtail possums captured for health screening and radio-collaring will also receive ear tags and identification transponders.</p>
<p>A small ear biopsy will be collected from each animal captured for translocation, health screening or radio-collaring for future genetic analyses to confirm genetic diversity and population sustainability.  This will be an essential follow-on from the translocation project if the latter appears successful on the basis of specific criteria for success (see Analytical Techniques section below).  Ear biopsies will be taken from the outer edge of the pinna of the ear under inhalation anaesthesia using a 5mm biopsy punch, leaving a notch on the edge of the ear.  Ear punches will be flame sterilised in between uses, and the animal’s skin will be disinfected prior to taking of the biopsy sample.  Ear tissue samples will be stored in DMSO<sub>4</sub> until genetic analyses can be carried out (these analyses are not part of the current project).  </p>
<p>3) Analytical techniques</p>
<p><em>a) Spatial analysis of data using GIS techniques and home range analysis software</em></p>
<p>All positional data (resting and foraging locations) will be imported into ArcGIS for visual display and for spatial analysis.  Location data will be collected using differential GPS to sub meter accuracy.  This will be particularly important for the results of spotlighting surveys (see below).  Analysis of home range data will be carried out using Ranges 6 software (Kenward_ et al._, 2003).  Correlations between digitally available habitat variables and characteristics of possum resting and foraging locations will be carried out to derive habitat suitability indices and to investigate partitioning of habitat use between possum species.  </p>
<p><em>b) Estimation of population density using Distance sampling techniques and software</em></p>
<p>Analysis of annual spotlighting surveys using Distance sampling protocols (Buckland_ et al.<em>, 2001) and DISTANCE software (Thomas</em> et al._, 2005) will be carried out to derive estimates of western ringtail and brushtail possum density in the study sites.  Survey transects will cover representative vegetation strata so that data can be analysed relative to habitat types.  Differential GPS will be used in the surveys to ensure accuracy of distance estimates from the transect line.  Results of analyses will provide evidence for or against habitat partitioning between the two possum species as well as providing density estimates of the translocated western ringtail possum population to quantify population growth/decline over time.</p>
<p>_c) Determination of survivorship and population viability using Information Theoretic techniques _</p>
<p>Results of survivorship monitoring of radio-collared western ringtail possums will be analysed using Program MARK mark-recapture software (White, 2001) in an Information-Theoretic framework (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).  A set of <em>a priori</em> candidate models will be examined to determine the model(s) which best describe survivorship.  Candidate models will include variables on fox and cat abundance (see below) and abundance estimates of other (alternative) prey species (see below).  Candidate models will also include habitat and environmental variables (vegetation strata, vegetation density, specific attributes of individual trees, aspect, slope, climate) and results of pre- and post-release health screening.  Recruitment data obtained from observations of reproductive status of radio-collared animals will also be used, as will data from the limited number of radio-collared recruits to the population, for subsequent modeling of population persistence (population viability analysis).  </p>
<p><em>d) Demonstration of criteria for success of translocation</em></p>
<p>A major objective of the analyses will be to assess whether translocation is considered successful.  Criteria for translocation success (from de Tores_ et al._, 2004) are:</p>
<p>·           Released possums establish regular use of dreys and/or tree hollows</p>
<p>·           Home range estimates are comparable to those reported in the literature for naturally occurring populations of western ringtail possums.  (Comparison of results with those obtained for the natural population in the Busselton region will contribute to this.)</p>
<p>·           Females produce young and the sex ratio of young is not significantly different from parity. </p>
<p>·           Dispersal patterns of young are consistent with that expected from the literature (i.e. female young stay within the natal range and male young disperse).  </p>
<p>·           Recruits to the population breed successfully.  </p>
<p>·           Sustainable increase of the translocated population. </p>
<p>·           Maintenance of genetic diversity and confirmation that breeding is not restricted to a limited number of individuals.  (This final criterion is beyond the scope of this project.)</p>
<p><strong>Methodology - Naturally occurring populations</strong></p>
<p>This aspect of the project involves research on naturally occurring populations of western ringtail possum (wrp) and common brushtail possum (cbp). The research will be undertaken at selected sites supporting naturally occurring populations of Western Ringtail Possums in the Busselton/Capel region (see Section 5(d) for sites). The study will focus on determining survivorship, reproductive success and habitat use for both possum species. The importance of site specific habitat variables to abundance, habitat use and habitat partitioning will also be examined. The project will involve long-term health monitoring to determine the health status and prevalence of specific diseases for both possum species.</p>
<p>This component of the research will largely employ the same methodology as the “translocation outcomes” component to provide new information on abundance, survivorship, reproductive success, habitat use, background health status and disease prevalence of both possum species in different ecological states.  The purpose of both projects considered together is to identify features enabling the success of translocated populations, and of influences contributing to lack of success. Without the background information provided by the “natural populations”, the results of the “translocated populations” study may be ambiguous. The findings of both projects will be a tool for planners and conservation managers involved with urban development, reserve development and long term strategies for conservation of the species.</p>
<p>The health and disease aspect of the project will involve collaboration with researchers at Murdoch University and interstate facilities, which will contribute to conservation medicine of marsupials in Australia. Intended outcomes include:</p>
<p>§         Establishment of haematological and biochemical references ranges for both possum species; neither of which are currently listed on Isis, the international physiological reference ranges database</p>
<p>§         Determination of exposure of wild populations to diseases that may affect possum populations or for which they may act as carriers for other marsupials: Toxoplasmosis, Chlamydiosis, Leptospirosis and Cryptococcosis</p>
<p>§         Evaluation of anaesthesia techniques commonly applied to other wild marsupial species, but for which there is little data for the western ringtail possum.</p>
<p>The immediate benefit of the information obtained will be in contributing to conservation management of the western ringtail possum via translocation.</p>
<p>The research will involve spotlighting, telemetry, and physical examination and biological sample collection. Animals involved in monitoring will be periodically recaptured for replacement of radio-telemetry collars, and sample collection. Details of all these procedures are described below.</p>
<p>The research aims to answer the following specific questions for the sites studied:</p>
<p>§         What is the overall abundance and density of extant WRP and CBP populations?</p>
<p>§         How does abundance and density change through the year?</p>
<p>§         What are patterns of survivorship of extant WRP and CBP?</p>
<p>§         What influence do factors such as season and density of both species have on survivorship?</p>
<p>§         What influence does physiological and disease status have on survivorship?</p>
<p>§         What are the features of habitat that are preferred by possums, for different activities?</p>
<p>§         What is the size, variability and spatial pattern of possum home ranges?</p>
<p>§         Is there evidence for spatial competition between WRP and CBP? Can any conclusions be drawn as to effective competition?</p>
<p>§         What are the baseline reference ranges for haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, faecal microbiology and parasitology, in the WRP and CBP?</p>
<p>§         What is the baseline indication of exposure to <em>Cryptococcus</em>, <em>Chlamydia</em>, <em>Leptospira</em> and <em>Toxoplasma</em> in the WRP and CBP? Is there evidence of clinical disease, and does this appear to influence survivorship?</p>
<p>§         What are the morphometric data in these populations of WRP and CBP?</p>
<p>§         In the case of death of individuals, what causes can be identified? What role does predation, by various species, play in survivorship?</p>
<p><em>Spotlighting</em></p>
<p>Determination of spotlighting transects will initially involve broadly stratifying each site for vegetation density in the lower and mid canopies. This will be achieved by examination of digital images and subsequent ground-truthing. Stratification is necessary to satisfy the requirements of the “Distance” abundance analysis program with respect to detectability. Individual transects may include more than one particular vegetation density stratum, but total length of transect of a particular stratum will be determined by the proportion of that stratum in the site. Transects will be straight and parallel, spaced 100m apart to avoid double counting of animals from the adjacent transect. It is expected that transects will be roughly between 200-1000m long.</p>
<p>Transects will be traversed at a slow walking pace by two operators, each scanning the habitat on one side of the transect. One of the two operators will always be the principal researcher. A third person may be present as a scribe and assistant. Hand held spotlights, powered by rechargeable batteries, and containing 20-35W globes will be used to scan all vegetation from the transect, and from ground level to directly overhead. The operators will be seeking to detect the reflection of light that signifies the eyeshine of mammals.</p>
<p>Spotlighting will be carried out at least once a year, to coincide with the season of greatest predicted abundance. If time permits, additional spotlighting at other times of year will hopefully indicate variation in abundance through the year.</p>
<p>The following information will be recorded (for use as covariates in Distance analyses) for each possum sighting:</p>
<p>§         Time</p>
<p>§         Number of individuals seen together</p>
<p>§         Species</p>
<p>§         Type of vegetation in the general vicinity: species of plants, height of canopy, approximate density of the vegetation (on a qualitative scale)</p>
<p>§         Species and total height of the tree containing the possum, height of the animal at the time it was first sighted</p>
<p>§         Special note of presence of hollow or drey</p>
<p>§         GPS recording of the location, using post-processing technology to increase the accuracy to within 1 metre</p>
<p>Analysis of location recordings to give an estimate of abundance will be carried out using the “Distance” software (Thomas_ et al._, 2005) and calculation of a detection function for the probability of a sighting with varying distance from the transect.</p>
<p><em>Radio-Telemetry</em></p>
<p>General</p>
<p>The aim is to have a minimum of 10 possums of each species at each of the four sites – a total of 40 WRP and 40 CBP at any one time over all sites – although more possums are likely to eventually be involved when loss through mortality is considered. This number will give sufficient data for the analyses listed above, although information on home range overlap and interactions between individuals may be limited.</p>
<p>The radio collars to be used are as described for the “translocation outcomes” component of the research.  Each radio collared possum will be located once a week, alternating between diurnal and nocturnal locations. Where full monitoring is underway, the following information will be recorded for each possum location:</p>
<p>§         Time</p>
<p>§         GPS recording of the location, using differential post-processing</p>
<p>§         Whether the possum was sighted; if so, comment on activity</p>
<p>§         Type of vegetation in the general vicinity: species of plants, height of canopy, approximate density of the vegetation (on a qualitative scale)</p>
<p>§         Species and total height of the tree containing the possum, height of the animal</p>
<p>§         If in a hollow or drey, details of approximate size etc</p>
<p>§         Details of other animals seen associated with the target animal</p>
<p>Time constraints may limit detailed monitoring to selected sites only, on a sequential basis. The sites not involved in detailed monitoring will be monitored for survivorship, by determining the viability of the possum at least once a week.</p>
<p><em>Trapping</em></p>
<p>The common brushtail possum will be initially captured with wire cage traps on the ground. The type of bait used, and the pattern and spacing of distribution is yet to be determined, and will depend on best results achieved in other studies. Traps will be checked every morning and removed as soon as sufficient possums have been caught to meet the monitoring quota.</p>
<p>Possums will be examined, sampled and radio-collared on the same day, and returned to the place of capture that evening.</p>
<p>Application and Reapplication of collars</p>
<p>The first capture for application of collars will occur by trapping for the common brushtail possum and by spotlighting and darting for the western ringtail possum.</p>
<p>It is expected that western ringtail possums will need to be recaptured every 4 months to renew the radio-collar within a safe time period to prevent collars going off the air. The similar interval for the common brushtail possum is 10 months as larger batteries are able to be used in this species.</p>
<p><em>Anaesthesia</em></p>
<p>Possums will be captured as described for collaring, and transported immediately to the Busselton Field Station. Immediately before processing (collection of morphometric measurements, samples for health assessment and disease screening, and re-collaring) the individual possum will be anaesthetised using “Isoflurane” administered by mask. Induction and maintenance rates are as described for the “translocation outcomes” component.  Zoletil and Isoflurane are recognised as the agents of choice for injectable and inhalation anaesthesia (respectively) in possums and gliders (Vogelnest, 1999).</p>
<p>Although it is intended that all anaesthesia processes will proceed smoothly, it is necessary to prepare for the emergency situation to ensure the safety and continued health of the animal.  An endotracheal tube will be used if required for emergency stabilisation of the airway. There will also be immediate access to drugs of cardiorespiratory stabilisation, such as “Adrenaline” and “Dopram”. Throughout the duration of the anaesthesia the body temperature of the animal will be supported by an electric, covered pet heating pad (Redflex); cloacal body temperature will be collected at the end of the sample collection procedure (not earlier, so as not to interfere with analysis of cloacal microbiology). A record of the anaesthetic administration (doses, heart rate, respiratory rate and depth, palpebral reflex, mucous membrane colour) will be included on the processing checklist.</p>
<p><em>Physical examination and sample collection under general anaesthesia</em></p>
<p><em>Purpose:</em></p>
<p>§         Physical examination and morphometric measurements</p>
<p>§         Establishment of baseline parameters of haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, faecal microbiology and parasitology</p>
<p>§         Establishment of baseline indication of exposure to <em>Cryptococcus</em>, <em>Chlamydia</em>, <em>Leptospira</em> and <em>Toxoplasma</em></p>
<p>§         Tissue sample collection for future genetic analysis</p>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<p>Collection of morphometric measurements, and samples for health assessment and disease screening, will occur when possums are captured for renewal of radio collars.  Ethics and budget plans for the project have allowed for health assessment and disease screening to be carried out twice a year on the WRP and once a year on the CBP, commencing winter/spring 2006.</p>
<p>Hence:</p>
<p>§         Only morphometric measurements will be collected at every radio collar renewal. </p>
<p>§         Health assessment and disease screening samples will be collected at only two of the three collar renewals for the WRP per year. Wherever possible, animals will be retested in the same and successive years to track their status through the course of the study. It is hoped that some animals will remain on the air, and be tested repeatedly, through the entire 24 months of fieldwork.</p>
<p>§         Health assessment and disease screening samples will be collected at collar renewals for the CBP to a maximum of 20 samples per year, with an additional allowance of 10 possums to allow for predation or other losses and hence inability to retest original animals; total annual samples = 30.</p>
<p>It is likely that the recollaring will become staggered through the year, hence sample collection will be similarly staggered across the seasons; comparison of results over various months will provide a good picture of changing health and disease status over the year.</p>
<p>Identification</p>
<p>The very first time an individual is captured a reflective ear tag (for identification of the individual as involved in the study) and microchip (for unique and retrievable identification of the individual) will be applied while the animal is under anaesthesia.  An ear biopsy will be taken for subsequent DNA analysis as described for the “translocation outcomes” component of the research.</p>
<p>Morphometric Measurements</p>
<p>The following information will be collected:</p>
<p>§         Bodyweight</p>
<p>§         Head length</p>
<p>§         Head-body length</p>
<p>§         Tail length</p>
<p>§         Right pes length</p>
<p>§         (Females) Presence and measurements of pouch young</p>
<p>Health Status Samples</p>
<p>The following information and samples will be collected:</p>
<p>§         Body condition / general appearance</p>
<p>§         Comment on normality or otherwise of eyes, ears, skin, teeth, urogenital tract</p>
<p>§         Collection of blood from lateral tail vein using aseptic technique – total volume allowed dictated by bodyweight of the animal (10% maximum, of 50ml/kg circulating blood volume). Collected by syringe and transferred into 1.3ml EDTA blood tube and 5ml Plain vacutainer (to the remaining allowable volume).</p>
<p>§         Urine – by manual expression of the bladder through the abdominal wall, where sufficient urine is present in the bladder. Placed in a vial and sent to Murdoch clinical pathology laboratory for routine urinalysis, with culture if evidence of significant pathogens.</p>
<p>§         Faeces – scats from the cage or bag. Placed in a vial and sent to Murdoch clinical pathology laboratory for parasitology analysis.</p>
<p>§         Cloacal microbiology – a moist swab will be wiped in the cloaca, to test for routine pathogens including Salmonella. Placed in transport medium and sent to Murdoch clinical pathology laboratory.</p>
<p>Disease Screening</p>
<p>The following diseases will be tested:</p>
<p>§         Chlamydia screening – 4 dry swabs will be carefully wiped over each of the oropharynx, conjunctiva bilaterally, and the cloaca. Placed in transport medium and frozen.</p>
<p>§         Cryptococcus screening – serum collected by the above procedure. Placed in plain tube and frozen.</p>
<p>§         Leptospirosis screening – serum collected by the above procedure. Placed in plain tube and frozen.</p>
<p>§         Toxoplasmosis screening – serum collected by the above procedure. Sent to the appropriate laboratory via Murdoch clinical pathology laboratory.</p>
<p>§         Ross River Virus screening (under consideration) – serum collected by the above procedure, sent via Murdoch clinical pathology laboratory.</p>
<p>§         Skin scrapings – where there is evidence of ectoparasites, or disease potentially caused by ectoparasites. Visible ectoparasites will be stored and transported in a small vial containing 70% Ethanol; skin scrapings will be stored and transported in a small vial containing a few drops of paraffin oil.</p>
<p>Holding and Release</p>
<p>Before and after processing at the field station, possums will be held in a soft cloth bag in a padded cardboard box, in a quiet environment. Temperature and air quality will be monitored as appropriate.</p>
<p>The possums will be released in the evening following health screening and/or radio-collaring (i.e. same day), so that total time away from the natural habitat is less than 24 hours. Immediate release during the day time is not possible for both logistical and ethical reasons: the normally nocturnal possums would be disorientated and at risk.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>Detailed mapping of each site with respect to vegetation species, form and structure, topography, special features and fire history, will be combined with the telemetry and spotlight monitoring data in GIS analysis to determine significant influences on habitat partitioning.</p>
<p>Survivorship monitoring data will also be as described for the “translocation outcomes” component through use of a set of a priori candidate models and model selection based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)  in “Program Mark” (White, 2001).</p>
<p>Analysis of home range and habitat use data will also be as described for the “translocation outcomes” component and will derive home range estimates through Ranges 6 software and will assess if there is selection and/or avoidance of specific habitat types through use of the “Jacobs index” (Kenward_ et al._, 2003) and/or Resource Selection techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Methodolgy - ecology of the south-west carpet python</strong></p>
<p>This aspect of the project will examine various aspects of the ecology of the south-west carpet python and, in particular, will examine its response, in a spatial context, to localised introduced predator control (fox baiting programs). It will examine the role and importance of the pythons as ambush predators to the translocation success of the western ringtail possum at coastal sites.  Information gained through this research will improve mammal translocation programs and will allow a better understanding of significant ecological interactions between threatened native predators and introduced predators.</p>
<p>This component of the project will also assess relationships between micro- and macro-habitat use, thermal biology (temperature regulation) in relation to microhabitat use and the influence of prey consumption, and prey distribution and abundance, to provide information for conservation strategies for this threatened species.</p>
<p>A third aspect to the python component of the research will determine whether implanting a radio transmitter into pythons causes any infectious or inflammatory response by examining python haematology pre-and-post implantation of the radio transmitters.  Blood samples will be collected prior to implantation and following implantation to enable assessment/detection of any infectious and/or inflammatory processes that may be caused by the implantation process. The thermal biology of the pythons will be monitored very closely post-implantation (using the heat-sensitive transmitters and a lazar temperature reader) for the following few days. Human patients will show signs of infection within 2-3 days post inoculation with increased body temperatures. </p>
<p>The fourth component will examine the genetic variation of carpet pythons at the coastal western ringtail possum translocation release sites.  This will allow baseline genetic data to be established. It will be valuable to conservation mangers to assess if populations are diverging genetically as increasing habitat loss may not be allowing sufficient genetic flow between populations of the same subspecies. Genetic data will also be useful for people managing reptiles as pets, where captive bred reptiles are genetically monitored and illegal taking of pythons from the wild can be traced more effectively. The genetic information will most likely be analysed through a collaborative effort with geneticists at Murdoch University. Measurements of genetic variation within the python population will involve scoring the presence or absence of attributes (genes or genetically determined morphological features) in the individuals, then extrapolating to arrive at estimates of the relative frequency of the attributes in the population (Lindenmayer and Burgman, 2005). </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Capture marking and identification of study animals</p>
<p>Pythons will be captured in the following ways:</p>
<p>(a) Pythons found (through the above radio telemetry monitoring of ringtail and brushtail possums) to have preyed upon either species of possum, will be captured and held for inclusion in the python ecology component of the research.  Pythons collected as a result of known predation events will be temporarily housed at the Dwellingup Research Centre until such time as the remains of the prey is regurgitated with the collar, or the collar is passed in a scat.  Alternatively, if the collar is not regurgitated or passed, once it is deemed that all prey has been digested and all faecal matter naturally passed, the python will be physically massaged to encourage it to regurgitate the radio collar. </p>
<p>(b) Attempts will be made to capture all pythons opportunistically sighted at the western ringtail possum translocation release sites.  These captures will most likely be a result of sightings at night when driving, during summer (when pythons are most active and may cross roads more often) and sightings by the research team and/or District CALM employees.  Guidance and approval from CALM’s Nature Protection Branch will be sought when developing protocols for CALM employees to opportunistically collect pythons that they find within the study areas. </p>
<p>Opportunistically caught pythons will be physically restrained using conventional methods for handling snakes (pythons will be collected with care using either or a combination of conventional ‘head-grab’ behind the quadrate bone and the use of specialised snake hook and metal rimmed rounded calico bag). Following capture the pythons will be placed into a Hessian or calico bag to be transported back to Dwellingup Research Centre for the procedures documented below.</p>
<p>Each python will be individually marked by scale marking as described by Pearson (2002), however, use of Trovan<sup>®</sup> inert passive transponders will be also be investigated as an alternative identification technique.  The south-west carpet python is known to be able to “pass” surgically implanted transmitters (Pearson, 2002) and this phenomenon may make use of transponders ineffective.</p>
<p>Radio telemetry and transmitter implantation</p>
<p>The monitored sample size will be determined by the number of known predation events of western ringtail and common brushtail possums, however a sample of 10 to 15 pythons is envisaged across all sites (exclusive of an approximate equal number of pythons monitored in the concurrent research in the northern jarrah forest).   Sterile radio transmitters will be surgically implanted into the abdominal cavity of each python. Different types (four sizes) of the temperature-sensitive radio transmitters (Holohil Systems Ltd., Canada) will be used depending on the size of the python. All transmitters will be &lt;5% of the python’s body mass. Aerials will be encased in 2mm non-toxic Silastic® tubing and the entire unit sealed with 734 flowable sealant (Dow Corning Corporation). The battery life of each transmitter used will vary depending upon the size of the transmitter. Smaller transmitters (3 or 5 g) will last for approximately 28 and 35 weeks respectively, whereas, the larger transmitters (13 or 21 g) will last between 18-24 months.</p>
<p>Transmitters will be calibrated using a waterbath and circulating heater (Thermoline, Australia) against a certified mercury bulb thermometer (±0.1ºC). Temperature will be increased by 5ºC increments from 0-40 ºC. The period between pulses will be recorded using a Period/PPM meter (Titley Electronics, Australia) together with the time taken to hear 10 pulses using a stopwatch. The former measure is used for calculating body temperature from an automated telemetry system and the latter for data collected during fieldwork. Body temperatures of the pythons will be determined by applying third-order polynomial equations derived from calibration data. Transmitters will be calibrated following removal from the pythons to ensure there has not been significant drift in calibration. </p>
<p>Pythons will be anaesthetised using Isoflurane (“Forthane”, Abbott Pty. Ltd.) gas anaesthesia, intubated and with intermittent positive pressure ventilation used to induce and maintain the anaesthesia. Once under anaesthesia, each python will be given an intra-muscular injection of Ceftazidime 20mg/kg, which is a long-acting antibiotic used to prevent peri-operative infection. While maintaining each python under anaesthesia, surgical implantation of the radio transmitters will be achieved using an aseptic technique into the peritoneum through a mid-lateral incision 10% of the snake’s snout-vent-length (SVL) anterior to the vent. Absorbable sutures will be used to close the incision. Once the python shows signs of recovery from the anaesthetic procedure they will be given an intra-muscular injection of Butorphanol at 0.5 mg/kg. Butorphanol is an analgesic agent and is thought to provide pain relief for up to approximately 4 hours in reptiles. It has a slight sedative effect so the snakes will be maintained in a warm, quiet environment for one-three nights following the surgery and then released to point of capture. The administration of Butorphanol is important for initial post-operative pain relief. Further medication for pain relief is not warranted since the surgery is a relatively simple procedure that does not involve incision through muscle, organs or bone. During anaesthesia, standard morphometric data will be recorded. Pythons that have been implanted will be followed using radio telemetry for the duration of the study period. When possible, pythons will be recaptured close to the end of battery life of the transmitter and removed or replaced if necessary. </p>
<p>Study pythons will be tracked on a week-to-fortnight basis over the study duration. Pythons will be tracked on foot using a 3-element yagi aerial (Sirtrak Ltd., New Zealand) and receiver (RX3, Biotelemetry Services, Australia). The exact position of the pythons will be determined using a differential GPS system (post-processing using Thales MobileMapper software). Previous studies suggest that most pythons do not typically flee when approached by researchers in the field (Pearson, 2002). Therefore, behaviour, posture, proportion of body in sun, cloud cover and aspects of micro- and macro-habitat use will be recorded. Temperature recordings will be taken to gain information on microhabitat use and thermal regulation of the pythons. Temperature recordings will be taken to assess the various insulator capabilities of microhabitats and thermoregulation of pythons, quantified with data loggers.  This aspect will investigate different options for data logging information including implanted data loggers (encased within the implanted vhf radio transmitter) and stand-alone loggers to record physiological and immediate microhabitat environmental data.</p>
<p>Dietary analysis</p>
<p>Pythons collected for implantation of radio transmitters will be held for brief periods (1-2 days) for dietary analysis, including analysis of diet in relation to body size (the south-west carpet python shows strong body size sexual dimorphism (Pearson, 2002)).  Captive held pythons that have recently consumed prey will be palpated to obtain regurgitated and faecal material (this will occur also to ensure pythons have an empty stomach prior to anaesthesia).  Additional collection of faecal and regurgitated material for analysis will occur in the field through the radio telemetry study. This will limit the time spent in contact with, and limit/negate time spent in captivity for the python. Collection for dietary analysis will most likely be made on a bimonthly basis for each study animal. Limited additional collection of regurgitated material will occur opportunistically, where there is clear evidence (bulge in python) that there is recently obtained prey. </p>
<p>The results from the dietary analysis will be compared with the seasonal availability of prey (see below) and in particular will examine whether the western ringtail possum is preferentially selected as a prey item.</p>
<p>Haematology</p>
<p>When pythons are anaesthetised (to implant transmitter) a blood sample will be collected from the ventral midline, prior to and post implantation. The serum collected will be used to undertake haematology analysis. The haematology testing will enable the detection of any infectious and/or inflammatory response to the radio transmitter being implanted. Without haematology testing, information on the health status of the study python may otherwise go undetected by basic visual examination.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis and computer programs - Telemetry data</p>
<p>For each individual python, location datasets will be divided into various categories (e.g. day/night, season, breeding status).  Survivorship will be modeled through the use of Program MARK (White, 2001).  Ranges 6 (Kenward_ et al._, 2003) using harmonic mean analyses will be used to generate an overall home-range estimate for each individual.  Home range estimates will be incorporated into a GIS (ESRI, 1999-2004) or analysed directly in Ranges (Jacobs Index) to determine if there is preferential use of any of the major habitat units (as identified and delineated through use of digital imagery in the GIS).  Habitat use will also be analysed between baited and unbaited sites.  </p>
<p>Genetic analysis</p>
<p>Genetic analysis may be possible as a collaborative project with a geneticist from Murdoch University, Dr Peter Spencer, and CALM’s Nature Protection Branch.  The scales removed from each study python at their initial capture will be used to provide the sample for genetic analysis.  In the absence, or in addition to scale marking, genetic analysis may use blood obtained for haematology analysis (as reptile red blood cells are nucleated and each cell therefore contains that individual’s DNA). A smear of blood will be placed onto FTA paper, dried and stored in a cool, dry environment for future analysis. Additional to blood smears, mouth swab sample collection for genetic analysis will occur.  Mouth swabs will be collected onto sterile cotton buds then smeared onto FTA paper, dried and stored in the same manner as the blood samples.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology - assessment of the seasonal availability of small to medium size vertebrate prey species</strong></p>
<p>This aspect of the project (carried out initially through an honours research program) will examine the spatial and temporal availability of a suite of alternative small to medium size vertebrate prey species at the western ringtail possum translocation sites and may also collect samples for subsequent analyses of the spatial and temporal availability of the invertebrate food resource.</p>
<p>The five western ringtail possum translocation release site will be examined.  The prey species abundance will be determined within a minimum of two major vegetation structural units at each site – the peppermint dominated unit and the more open tuart / jarrah / banksia woodland.  The relative proportions of each major unit at each site will be determine through aerial photograph interpretation (or more specifically, digital image interpretation using a GIS (ESRI, 1999-2004)).</p>
<p>A minimum of two trapping webs will be established within each of the five sites.  Web design (Lukacs_ et al.<em>, 2005) will be utilised to enable quantitative data analyses and estimates of abundance through DISTANCE Sampling (Thomas</em> et al.<em>, 2002) and mark-recapture techniques (White, 2001) and will incorporate analyses through the Information–Theoretic and multimodel selection approach (Buckland</em> et al._, 2001; Burnham and Anderson, 2002).  A major objective of this component of the research will be to assess the feasibility of using trapping webs as opposed to the more widely used, but less quantitative, techniques such as convenience and transect trapping.  The latter report only known to be alive and/or capture success rates.</p>
<p>Each trapping web will incorporate Sheffield wire cage traps, Elliott folding aluminium box traps and vertebrate pitfall traps (the specific design of the vertebrate pitfall traps is yet to be determined).  Invertebrate sampling will utilise pitfall traps consistent with the FORESTCHECK design.  Each web will be approximately 4.5ha in area.</p>
<p><strong>Methodology - Assessment of fox and cat density, survivorship and use of the landscape</strong></p>
<p>Estimates of fox abundance will be derived through modified use of the sandplotting technique previously used and validated in Operation Foxglove (de Tores_ et al.<em>, in prep) whereby 25 sandplots, each 1mx1m were established within a grid/roading network of approximately 25km<sup>2</sup>, with a minimum distance of 500m between neighbouring sandplots.  Each sandplot was placed at the edge of an existing road or track, with the shape of sandplot grid/web network determined by the existing road and track network.  The exact area required to capture all 25 sandplots within each sandplot grid/web network was determined by calculating the minimum convex polygon (MCP) which encompassed all sandplots (Ranges6 software) (Kenward</em> et al._, 2003).  A 500m buffer (ESRI, 1999-2004) was added to the Ranges determined MCP to estimate the final area capturing all 25 sandplots within each grid/web network.</p>
<p>A small cube of approximately 50g of fresh mutton was buried 5-10mm below the surface of the sand.  The sand was then raked smooth and lightly sprayed with water.  Each sandplot was monitored daily for ten consecutive days.  The presence/absence of fox spoor (i.e. track or scat) or other recognisable evidence of fox activity on each sandplot was recorded daily.  Presence of spoor was interpreted as an indicator of fox presence.  Identifiable spoor and evidence of activity of other species were also recorded.  The removal of rewards (mutton) was recorded and each removed reward was replaced.  All rewards were periodically checked and partially decomposed rewards were replaced.  Sandplots showing evidence of activity and/or removal of rewards were re-raked and each sandplot, whether showing activity or not, was lightly re-sprayed with water daily.  Sandplots were monitored immediately prior to the delivery of 1080 baits.  </p>
<p>Where neighbouring sandplots showed evidence of fox activity this was interpreted as indicating the presence of the same fox at those plots.  A break in continuity of sandplots showing evidence of activity, with two or more sandplots without evidence of activity between sandplots showing activity, was interpreted as indicating the presence of an additional fox.  Similarly, a break of more than 1km between plots showing activity was interpreted as indicating the presence of additional foxes.  The pattern of sandplots showing activity was mapped daily.  The estimated number of foxes was recorded daily at each sandplot grid/web and the cumulative mean after ten days was derived as: Cumulative mean number of foxes = (cumulative number of foxes / number of days monitored).</p>
<p>A pairwise correlation matrix (StataCorp, 2005) was then generated for the daily cumulative mean for days one to ten for the pooled data for all years, pre 1080 baiting.  The correlation value (r) was then plotted for each day.  An r value (correlation) of 0.9009 was observed at six days.</p>
<p>Fox density was estimated for each sandplot grid/web network by dividing the cumulative mean number of foxes at day 10 by the area derived from the MCP, inclusive of the 500m buffer.  </p>
<p>The above methodology will be adopted at three of the western ringtail possum translocation sites (Leschenault, Preston Beach Road and Martins Tank/Lake Pollard), with the following variations/modifications:</p>
<p>·       only one network of sandplots will be established at each site;</p>
<p>·       the area estimate of each sandplot network will be derived exclusive of the buffer, or with a reduced buffer;</p>
<p>·       sandplots will be monitored seasonally, for six days only each season;</p>
<p>·       the meat lure/reward will be placed (randomly) at 50% of the sandplots; and</p>
<p>·       each sandplot will also be treated with the Pestat Ltd developed lure, synthetic fermented egg (FeralMone<sup>®</sup>).</p>
<p>Fox scats will be collected seasonally, during and immediately post sandplotting.  The presence of fox activity will be used to select trap placement (Victor Soft Catch, padded leg hold traps) for fox trapping.  Trapped foxes will be fitted with ARGOS satellite telemetry radio tags which, subject to developmental trials, will incorporate contact/proximity circuitry.  Satellite tags will be “duty tasked” to enable collection of diurnal and nocturnal location records and to minimise the effects of autocorrelation.  The number of radio collared foxes and hence the sample size for analyses of habitat use and use of the landscape, will be determined by capture rates.  Trapping will be carried out seasonally, post sandplotting, and opportunistically when fox presence is observed, to maintain the radio collared sample size.  The use of contact/proximity is proposed to assist in determining the predator responsible for predation events and to assist in the detection and extent of intraguild predation.  Radio telemetry monitoring will also determine if the fox population within the baited areas is being “turned over” by successive baiting events, or if there is a resident “bait shy” / “bait avoiding” population.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Estimating cat abundance and assessment of use of the landscape by cats</em></strong></p>
<p>A combination of lures (the felid attracting phonid, or FAP), rewards, leg hold and wire cage traps and camera stations will be used to monitor for the presence of cats.  At worst, data from these techniques will be used to derive an index to abundance.  A suite of techniques will also be trialled for collection of hair/hair follicles for identification of individuals through molecular techniques.  As per the molecular analyses of fox populations, the conservation implications of the cat population genetic structure will be examined.</p>
<p>Trapped cats will also be fitted with also ARGOS satellite telemetry radio tags which, again subject to developmental trials, will incorporate contact/proximity circuitry, as per the fox satellite telemetry.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fox dietary analyses</em></strong></p>
<p>The seasonally collected fox scats will be examined to determine the major dietary items and to examine the temporal and spatial variation in fox diet.  This variation will be compared with the temporal and spatial availability of medium and small mammal prey species and reptile species.  </p>",required,False,"<p>The number of voucher ringtail and brushtail specimens is dependent on the number of mortality events (a subset only of mortality events for the western ringtail possum and common brushtail possum will be forwarded to the WAM). Possums dying during the course of the study will undergo a post mortem at Murdoch University if considered necessary or appropriate. This may include cases where the cause of death is, or is not, obvious. As well as contributing to assessment of causes of mortality, post mortem at Murdoch University is likely to provide educational value for veterinary students on pathology rotation, enhancing exposure to and awareness of issues surrounding marsupial conservation in Western Australia. Python mortalities will be held initially for post mortem and subsequently forwarded to the West Australian Museum. A representative sample of each of the reptile and small mammal species trapped will be forwarded to the WAM – exact number is unknown. Retriered fox and cat carcasses will be held for examination of gut contents and, subject to the requirements of the WAM, subsequently forwarded to the WAM. </p>",not required,False,not required,"<p>Each of the three PhD students and the honours student will have ownership and data management responsibilities for their respective research areas. However, the following general principles will be adopted: • Hard copies of data collected during processing of animals or in the field will be filed and stored for backup and reference. • All data collected during the project will be entered into the relevant relational database (in MS Access) which will be built to conform with database normalisation principles. Databases will have a purpose built front end. • The databases will be designed to enable component data sets to be easily linked and analysed. For example, the unique identifier for each individual possum/python/fox/cat will be used as a key field in a base table, with referential integrity links to secondary tables holding data on health screening, radio-collaring, radio-telemetry location monitoring records, predation events and ultimate fate. Habitat data will be stored similarly. Results such as haematology/biochemistry reference ranges may eventually be posted on external databases such as Isis. Findings will be published primarily as a PhD Theses (Murdoch University) and in scientific journals covering topics including but not limited to conservation biology, zoology, ecology, veterinary pathology and wildlife disease; unpublished internal reports where appropriate; and occasional newsletters and presentations to interest groups, e.g. FAWNA (the wildlife carer group in Busselton) </p>",,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, OVertime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"

Rehabilitation of sites through revegetation requires knowledge of the genetic adaptation of the species to the sites in order to manage these sites on an ecologically sustainable basis. This requires an understanding of the genetic structure and local adaptation of the species. 

 

CALM has provided guidelines to Forest Products Commission that collections of seed for rehabilitation of understorey species in forest sites should be made within a 20km radius of the site. It is generally agreed in the scientific community that local seed sources should be used in rehabilitation so as to protect the genetic integrity of sites and maintain any adaptive variation that has developed through evolutionary history. However, the definition of “local” is very vague and rarely directly specified. 

 

There is no scientific data to underpin the determination of seed collection zones in Western Australian forests. Identification of appropriate seed source distances requires information on the level and extent of local adaptation and underlying genetic diversity within species. This information can be obtained through growth trials and analysis of genetic diversity. By determining this information for a range of species with different life histories and breeding systems, general guidelines on seed collection zones can be developed that will be implemented in forest rehabilitation programs.

 

The project will initially be focused on species in the Jarrah and Karri forest where seed is used for rehabilitation after logging by Forest Products Commission. Later the project may be expanded to include species outside the south-west forest areas.

 

 

 

The project relates to the following strategy in the Corporate Plan:

 

Manage the forests and woodlands entrusted to us, and the resources they provide, on an ecologically sustainable basis over time.

The European red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) arrived in the south-west of WA in the late 1920s (King and Smith 1985) and has been implicated in the decline of several species of medium-sized marsupials (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989).  Like all canids, foxes are highly susceptible to the toxin sodium monofluoroacetate, or 1080 (McIlroy 1981, McIlroy and King 1990) while most native WA mammals are tolerant to this poison (King _et al._ 1978, 1981; Mead _et al._ 1979).  In areas of Western Australia where foxes were controlled with regular 1080 poisoning, populations of rock-wallabies (_Petrogale lateralis_), numbat (_Myrmecobius fasciatus_), tammar wallaby (_Macropus eugenii_), woylie (_Bettongia penicillata_), brushtail possum (_Trichosurus vulpecula_), and chuditch increased significantly (Kinnear _et al._ 1988, 1998, Kinnear 1990, Friend 1990, Start _et_ _al. _1998, Morris _et al_. 2003).  In 1996, the Western Shield fauna recovery program commenced (Bailey 1996), with fox baiting occurring over approximately 3.5 million hectares of conservation estate.  In a short space of time, this led to a significant increase in woylie, quenda (southern brown bandicoot _Isoodon obesulus_) and tammar wallaby populations, and in 1998 these species were removed from the State and Commonwealth threatened fauna lists (Morris _et al._ 1998).

 

 

 

However, by 2000/2001 Western Shield monitoring started to detect declines in populations of some medium-sized mammals, most notably woylies, which had attained extremely high abundances (up to 60% trap success).  In a review of Western Shield in 2003, Orell (2005) identified several sites in the south-west of WA where fauna had not recovered, or had declines, despite ongoing fox control.  Lake Magenta nature reserve was one of these sites.  Chuditch were reintroduced to Lake Magenta in 1996 and woylies were translocated there in 1997. Following 12 months of fox control, populations of the quenda and brushtail possum were also discovered. Presumably they had persisted at Lake Magenta prior to fox control commencing, but at undetectable levels.  Trap success rates for all species increased in the period 1996-2001.  However, after this time, trap success rates for quenda and woylies declined to a point where they are no longer trapped, and chuditch and brushtail possums have persisted, but at reduced abundances.

 

 

 

This project is part of a larger program examining introduced predator control and sustained fauna recovery in the rangelands and south-west of WA.  In particular this project will be examining whether there has been a mesopredator release effect after several years of fox control ie have other introduced / native predators increased in abundance and become a threatening process for fauna survival.

<p>Two study sites will be used, Lake Magenta nature reserve (104 000ha), 400 km south-east of Perth and nearby Dunn Rock nature reserve and adjacent UCL (ca 65 000ha).  Lake Magenta has been fox baited since 1996, Dunn Rock has never been fox baited.  Study sites will be visited for 5 - 10 days every 8 – 12 weeks throughout the year.  Vegetation descriptions of each of the trapping grids will be undertaken by consultant botanist Ms Anne Rick.  Plant specimens will be lodged in the Newdegate Regional Herbarium, and the WA herbarium where necessary.</p>
<h1><strong><em>Index of relative fox and feral cat abundance</em></strong></h1>
<p>Sand pads will be set at 400m intervals along replicated linear transects (tracks) of 20 – 25 km at both Lake Magenta and Dunn Rock. Sand pads will be of two types – an ‘active’ pad comprising a 1m x 1m sand pad on the side of the transect with audible (FAP) and scent lures (pongo), and a ‘passive’ pad comprising a sand strip 1 m wide across the whole 4-5 m track, with no lures. Active and passive pads will be alternated along the transect.  Presence / absence of fox, feral cat and other mammals will be recorded on each pad over four consecutive nights. An index describing relative population levels will be determined according to the methodology of Engeman (2005). The presence / absence of native species such as malleefowl, bandicoots and woylies will also be determined from sand pad monitoring. Differences in activity of foxes and feral cats will be determined through comparisons of mean indicies and their standard errors within and between sampling periods. Sand pads will be assessed at regular times after fox baiting activities on Lake Magenta to provide some indication of the effectiveness of current baiting regimes. Fox and cat scats will be collected and stored for DNA analysis by an IA CRC post-doctoral scientist. Remote digital cameras will also be used to assist in the identification of individual foxes and cats.</p>
<h1><strong><em>Fox and feral cat diet</em></strong></h1>
<p>Foxes and feral cats will be recorded and samples shot along a standard vehicle transect near the boundaries of Lake Magenta and Dunn Rock reserves.  Dietary, morphometric and reproductive information will be collected. Numbers shot is difficult to estimate, but would be in the order of 6-10 animals per shooting trip (6 times per year).</p>
<p><strong><em>Relative abundances of small vertebrates and medium-sized mammals</em></strong></p>
<p>Small vertebrates will be sampled in the dominant vegetation types of both reserves through a system of trapping grids.  Five grids will be installed on each reserve.  Each grid will comprise 5 x 5 pit (20 L buckets, 7 m fence) set at 20m intervals (each covering an area of 1 ha). Similarly configured trapping grids comprising medium Elliott traps will also be used to target native rodent populations. Medium-sized mammals will be sampled by linear trapping transects covering 20 km in each reserve.  Medium Sheffield wire cage traps will be set at 200 m intervals, large Sheffield wire cage traps (for feral cats) will be set at 2km intervals.<strong> </strong>Grid and transect trapping will occur for four consecutive nights. Seasonal species diversity and relative abundances will be determined for each reserve.  This will be related to cat/fox diet to determine if prey availability influences baiting effectiveness.  </p>
<h5>Translocations of predator-vulnerable species</h5>
<p>Once information on the effectiveness of current fox baiting regimes has been obtained, and a bait becomes available to control feral cats (anticipated in December 2007), it is proposed to introduce a baiting regime that demonstrably reduces fox and feral cat abundance, and to release predator – vulnerable native mammals into Lake Magenta.  It is proposed that in 2007, bilbies (<em>Macrotis lagotis</em>) would be released, followed by boodies (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) in 2008.  Translocation proposals for each species will be prepared and these will detail the release and monitoring protocols to be followed.</p>
<h1><strong><em>Disease prevalence and transmission</em></strong></h1>
<p>The occurrence of disease agents / parasites will be determined through a collaboration with Murdoch University, and potentially an ARC Linkage grant.  All native and introduced mammals trapped / shot will be investigated for haemoparasites, faecal parasites and ectoparasites and other potential diseases. A protocol for doing this will be developed in collaboration with Murdoch University. Up to 10 individual of each species could be sampled over a year.</p>

The Earth’s biota is facing profound risks of damaging climate change during this century. This is due to steeply rising CO~2~ emissions and positive feedbacks which reinforce and amplify human-caused global warming. Some degree of global warming is inevitable due to the concentration of CO~2~ already in the atmosphere. Thus, to protect biota, effective climate change adaptation strategies are now required.

 

Many taxa have survived past regional climate changes by contracting to dispersed refuges characterised by features that ameliorate climate impacts. Such refuges will likely contribute to the persistence of species and ecological communities under anthropogenic global warming. The identification and management of climate refugia is therefore a vital component of climate change adaptation strategies.

 

In Australia, the south-western Australian (SWWA) global biodiversity hotspot is already experiencing climate change attributed in part to global warming, and there are predictions for further warming and drying in the area. This old, highly weathered and flat landscape offers little scope for the biota to migrate to altitudinal refuges. However, the landscape is characterised by numerous granite outcrops and inselbergs scattered across the mesic to semi-arid rainfall gradient. These minor variations in topographic complexity may serve to ameliorate the impacts of climate change for the flora of this hotspot.

 

Identifying the characteristics and occurrence in landscapes of potential climate refuges is a key international climate change research agenda that requires transdisciplinary approaches in the ecological, evolutionary and spatial sciences. In this project we use a transdisciplinary approach to understand past dispersal and contraction of species and scalar relationships with regional landscape components to contribute to developing effective Climate Change Integrated Conservation Strategies.

 
","<p>We propose that granite outcrops (GOs) provide important climate refuges for plant species and ecological communities. We investigate the potential of GOs and their associated environments to act as refuges in the face of anthropogenic climate change across the south-western Australian climatic gradient. We investigate the biophysical mechanisms facilitating persistence of species and ecological communities in GO climate refuges by asking the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do topographic and micro-habitat features of GOs designate them as refugia?</li>
<li>Do phylogeographic patterns demonstrate that GOs have acted as refuges in the past and are important reservoirs of genetic diversity?</li>
<li>Are particular environments at the base of GOs more productive, and are individual plants in these environments under less stress than those in the intervening matrix?</li>
<li>Are the plant communities of GOs more resilient to anthropogenic climate change disturbances than the communities of the surrounding landscape matrix?</li>
</ol>","<p>By identifying areas that can act as refugia under projected climate conditions, adaptation and conservation activities can be focused where they will provide greatest benefit. The many granite outcrops scattered across the mesic to semi-arid rainfall gradient of the region include over 17 % of the State’s vascular flora in less than 1 % of its area. We contribute to developing conservation strategies for outcrop flora by examining the evidence of granite outcrops as refugia and as reservoirs of genetic diversity. </p>",<p>Nature Conservation and Regional Services Divisions</p>,<p>The project is managed by Curtin University.</p>,,<p>See section E4 of the final ARC Linkage LP0990914 proposal. </p>,required,False,,not required,False,not required,<p>Curtin University</p>,,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, OVertime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"

1790,<p>CF 2011-106&nbsp;Online GIS biodiversity mapping (NatureMap)</p>,"<p>One of the department&rsquo;s corporate goals is to conserve biodiversity. A key strategy for achieving this is acquiring scientific knowledge to underpin decision-making. The department therefore invests heavily in ecological survey (from small area- inventory through to major regional surveys) and on-going monitoring projects from which data are&nbsp;collected through field observation and analysed to produce new information. Because of the size of Western Australia, and the inaccessibility of many sites, data collection is typically the most expensive component of producing new information and understanding, and the datasets are often irreplaceable.</p>
<p>However, the majority of datasets collected through survey are not lodged in a corporately accessible and managed environment. While the department maintains some&nbsp;corporate scientific and management databases, these capture only a small proportion of data generated through survey, probably less than 25%. The remainder of datasets are managed on a per-project basis, satisfying individual project requirements, but invariably without due attention to on-going data maintenance and availability. To compound the issue, an increasing number of scientists and project officers responsible for historical datasets are close to retirement age. The department therefore faces an increasing and significant risk of data loss.</p>
<p>Compounding the situation,&nbsp;data are stored in various ways ranging from spreadsheets to Microsoft Access, on desktops, laptops, or local file servers. As such, security and data protection&nbsp;are dependent on the data custodian, resulting in inconsistent practices and increased likelihood of data loss or corruption. In addition, data access is typically limited to local users, or restricted by vendor-specific applications. Departmental requirements for linking to related systems&nbsp;are&nbsp;generally not considered. And, finally, while survey methodologies are well understood, inadequate attention is paid&nbsp;to data collection and management standards (particularly ecological data, which still has developing standards), and therefore inconsistency and lack of documentation in how data attributes are defined.</p>","<ul>

<p>Science&nbsp;Division (2008) A Strategic Plan for BIodiversity Conservation Research 2008-2017. Department of Environment and Conservation, Perth, WA.</p>","<p>Design principles and approach for BioSys include&nbsp;two key attributes: <em>open source development</em>, and <em>scalability</em>. All intellectual property created during BioSys development will be made available through the open source paradigm. While early stages of development will be kept in-house, once BioSys has reached a basic level of acceptance and maturity, the source code will be housed within a publicly accessible repository. Other developers and research institutions will be able to contribute to the code base so that the software will benefit from potentially many sources.</p>
<p>Key reasons for making the source publicly available include&nbsp;a) providing a public good benefit given that BioSys has been developed using public funds, and b) benefitting from the keen interest that other parties have already expressed, and the additional expertise they could bring to the project.</p>
<p>There has been a high level of difficulty in the conceptual design of the&nbsp;database thus far. Ecological data is, by its nature, complex.&nbsp;Additionally, survey protocols change over time as&nbsp;knowledge and techniques improve, resulting in different attributes being collected. And, finally, the lack of ecological data standards, together with&nbsp;a culture of independence amongst some researchers,&nbsp;contributes to even greater variation in survey protocols and&nbsp;data content and organisation.</p>
<p>This leads to a&nbsp;second key design attribute: scalability. It is a challenge to design a database that will scale to increasing&nbsp;data&nbsp;complexity and variability so that all ecological data can be captured and curated, while on the other hand providing reports and outputs in consistent formats for scientific research, conservation planning or environmental impact assessment, or&nbsp;consumption by other information systems.&nbsp;Traditional methods (e.g. relational databases) do not have the flexibility to accommodate complex ecological data.&nbsp;BioSys is therefore being designed using the most recent techniques for storing and updating semi-structured data that provide the required scalability and flexibility.</p>
<p>An inherent tradeoff with the above approach is that variability in data structure will be replicated within the database. Inconsistencies in how researchers manage their data will potentially be perpetuated. It is not possible to guarantee storage&nbsp;and curation of any dataset, while also&nbsp;guaranteeing those datasets can be consolidated into a single, monolithic, relational data model (e.g. for reporting or data exchange purposes). That is a much harder&nbsp;proposition.</p>
<p>The BioSys project is therefore a long-term project. In the first instance, risk of data loss must be mitigated. It is therefore more important that data is captured and protected within a corporate system ""as is"", than attempting the harder task of data standardisation. BioSys will also allow data to be curated, the system potentially becoming the&nbsp;point of truth, rather than the desktop. Development will be incremental and adaptive&nbsp;- system capability and design will be enhanced as new datasets and survey protocols extend conceptual boundaries. In subsequent years, other capabilities will be added (subject to available resourcing), such as offline data capture tools that feed into BioSys.</p>
<p>Architecturally, BioSys is being developed as a web-based application using OIM-preferred and supported technologies.</p>
<p><strong>BioSys</strong>&nbsp;is being implemented in a phased approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build database to support Kimberley Land Conservation Initiative (LCI) monitoring data and&nbsp;Kimberley Island survey data</li>
<li>Release minimum viable product for acceptance testing</li>
<li>Test and adapt database design by accommodating Pilbara and other key survey data sets</li>
<li>Implement a standardised ecological data model based on outcomes from initiatives such as Essential Measures vegetation working group</li>
<li>Evaluate feasibility of an offline data entry tool</li>
<li>Invite co-development from interested parties</li>
</ul>
<p>The phased approach described above is dependent on ongoing funding. Estimates below are based on current and historical funds provided from the Kimberley Land Conservation Initiative, at Director's discretion, but this is not an indication such funds will continue to be provided in the future.

"," 

Land clearing and subsequent fragmentation of native vegetation and habitats is a major threat to biodiversity (Hobbs & Yates 2003; Burgman et al. 2007). Among the many impacts are changes to fire regimes brought about by changes in sources and frequency of ignition and continuity of fuel loads. In some landscapes, fragments experience an increase in fire frequency (one component of a fire regime) because they are exposed to more intensive use by humans and greater sources and frequency of ignition (Kemper et al. 1999; Tabarelli & Gascon 2005). In other landscapes, the displacement of traditional human societies and active fire management practices, discontinuous vegetation cover and/or advances in fire suppression cause declines in fire frequency in fragments (Ross et al. 2002; Hobbs & Yates 2003). 

 

Changes in fire regimes can have substantial impacts on plant species composition and abundance. Extremes of fire frequency and scale may cause local population declines or extinctions (Bradstock et al. 2002). Long intervals between fires risk the decline or loss of species that recruit exclusively or predominately in the post-fire environment if the interval between fires exceeds plant and seed longevity, and/or risk an ecologically dysfunctional abundance of certain fire-susceptible species (Withers & Ashton 1977; Burgman & Lamont 1992; Yates & Ladd 2005). Alternatively, fires that are too frequent can also cause species decline, either directly (if fire frequency is less than the juvenile period for obligate-seeding species, or if these species otherwise fail to recruit post-fire), or indirectly, through facilitating weed invasion (Hobbs & Yates 2003; Yates et al. 2003).

 

South-western Western Australia (SWWA) is a globally significant hotspot for plant diversity and endemism (Hopper & Gioia 2004). However, the native vegetation of large parts of this region has been extensively cleared for agriculture. In parts of the wheatbelt, as little as 2-3% of the native vegetation remains (Hobbs & Saunders 1992), existing in fragments of varying sizes, shapes, degree of isolation, tenures, history and landuses, and surrounded by agricultural land. The wheatbelt region has historically experienced fires, and many plants possess traits that enable them to persist and prosper in a fire-prone environment (Burrows & Abbott 2003). Many fragments are characterized by long intervals between fires (Brown & Hopkins 1983; Hobbs & Atkins 1991) and may be experiencing a different contemporary fire regime from the regime prior to land clearance (Yates et al. 1994; Hobbs 2003; McCaw & Hanstrum 2003). 

 

Partly as a consequence of perceived differences in fire regimes in fragments, and the subsequent biodiversity conservation problems this may pose (together with asset protection concerns), recent steps have been taken to increase active fire management in the southern wheatbelt region, particularly in larger fragments (McClusky et al. 2003). Prior to this management change, most fires resulted from lightning strike or escapes from neighboring agricultural properties, and were actively suppressed in native vegetation (McClusky et al. 2003). 

 

While the responses of some individual species and communities to particular fire regimes or fire events have been studied (Yates et al. 2003; Yates & Ladd 2004), what may constitute an appropriate fire regime for biodiversity conservation in this region is poorly understood. Regional knowledge of upper and lower limits of fire intervals for plant communities is lacking, which prevents the definition of appropriate fire-return interval ranges. 

 

Gaining this understanding of fire responses is also compromised by the lack of knowledge of landscape and historical patterns of fire, and how these may relate to current landscape configurations. An understanding of fire history is also important for interpreting current patterns of vegetation composition (Bond and van Wilgen 1996).

 

DEC uses a variety of methods prior to wildfire events to reduce the risk of fires to life, property and natural assets (Shedley 2007). One of these, scrub rolling or chaining, consists of a chained strip of natural vegetation, which is burnt at a later date. This technique facilitates fuel reduction by rendering prescribed burns easier to manage (via reduced flame heights) and initiate (through creating a more continuous fuel bed and drier fuel) (McCaw and Smith 1992). Scrub rolling and burning has the potential to have significant impacts on plant communities. Vegetation rolling (without subsequent fire) can change the composition of the vegetation community (Pelton and Conran 2002). The use of fire after chaining adds additional possibilities for impacts on vegetation, through the complex interactions of fire and plant characteristics. Some plant fire response types may be more vulnerable to burning after chaining than others. Obligate seeding species with canopy stored seed may be particularly at risk, as seed capsules may open due to desiccation following plant or shoot death after chaining, leaving the seeds unprotected during the subsequent fire (McCaw and Smith 1992; Shedley 2007). In a study of two serotinous species, McCaw and Smith (1992) found that one (Hakea pandanicarpa spp. crassifolia) released seeds soon after chaining, but another (Banksia baxteri) did not. Consequently, they recommended burning within ‘a few’ weeks of chaining to reduce the risk of local loss of serotinous species. The effects of scrub rolling and burning on other plant fire response types, other serotinous genera and species, and the vegetation community as a whole, has not been studied.

 
","<ul>
<li>Map the recent fire history across a sample study area of the southern WA wheatbelt to determine if there are differences in fire regime (fire frequency, season, intensity and extent) related to landscape configuration (i.e. between native vegetation fragments of differing sizes, and between fragments and extensive areas of uncleared vegetation). If differences are detected, can these be related to varying sources of ignition, spatial barriers to fire spread, or fire suppression activities?</li>
<li>Investigate how vegetation structure and composition changes with increasing time since fire in two widespread vegetation associations in the wheatbelt; mallee with an understorey of Melaleuca uncinata and Proteaceae species, and Tallerack mallee-heath. This study will also assist with the identification of target plant species for more detailed study (i.e. those sensitive to fire interval – next aim). </li>
<li>Determine the approximate upper and lower limits of inter-fire intervals for species susceptible to fire-related decline in fragments in the WA wheatbelt.</li>
<li>Investigate the of impact scrub rolling and burning on vegetation communities. We aim to determine if (i) there are differences in species composition between areas of three different fire management treatments: rolled and burnt, burnt in the same fire but not rolled, and vegetation neither (recently) burnt nor rolled; (ii) if there are differences in recruitment between assemblages of taxa grouped on the basis of traits relevant to recruitment after fires and other disturbances (Gill 1999; Pausas et al. 2004): obligate seeders (further divided into those with canopy- or soil-stored seed), resprouters (subdivided into those with canopy and soil-stored seed) and fire ephemeral herbs; and (iii) if any effects of scrub rolling and burning are consistent across multiple ‘events’.</li>
<li>Determine whether prescribed fire promotes weed invasion in mallee and heath communities in nature reserves in the wheatbelt, and to identify areas most at risk. Specifically, we aim to test whether: (i) invasions are limited by seed availability or opportunities for seedling establishment (by comparing weed establishment in plots with and without added weed seeds); (ii) fragmentation enhances vulnerability to weed invasion (by comparing plots adjacent to remnant boundaries with plots adjacent to interior roads and plots away from all edges; this tests whether invasions are limited by factors associated with edges, such as soil nutrient enrichment or greater water availability); and (iii) fire enhances weed invasion (by comparing burnt and unburnt plots).</li>
</ul>","<p>The various components of this project will provide much needed data for informing ecological fire management in plant communities that are widely distributed across Wheatbelt and South Coast Region Nature Reserves. Specifically:</p>
<p>1.   Investigating the recent fire history of vegetation fragments in the wheatbelt will increase our understanding of how recent landscape change affects fire regimes, and how current fire regimes may differ from that expected in areas of extensive equivalent vegetation. </p>
<p>2.   Investigating the responses of mallee and mallee-heath communities to increased time since fire will address one of the key information gaps limiting ecologically appropriate fire management in the wheatbelt; that of an appropriate fire return interval for these communities. </p>
<p>3.   Investigating the impacts of scrub-rolling on mallee-heath vegetation will provide data for analysis of the benefits to and impacts on biodiversity of this management treatment.</p>
<p>4.   Investigating the relationship between fire, landscape position and annual grass invasion will provide data on the risk of invasions following fire. </p>","<p>The knowledge gained by this project will be most directly used by DEC staff in planning and undertaking fire management activities, and conserving plant species and communities, in Wheatbelt and South Coast Region Nature Reserves. The findings of the research will be disseminated through scientific publications in peer reviewed journals, Science Division information sheets, participation in conferences and workshops, and presentations to regional staff.</p>",<p>Monthly milestones will be established through the BCI reporting process and reported on at three monthly intervals.

704,"All current and future SPP’s where invertebrate wet pit trapping is required
","Wet pitfall trapping has been a method used for at least the last 30 years (Martin 1977) to sample assemblages of ground dwelling invertebrate across time frames ranging from weeks to several months and, occasionally years.  This sampling method utilises open containers (often one or two litre plastic jars) containing preservative solutions and buried flush with the ground. Where these traps are set over long time frames preservative solutions that are stable and do not evaporate have been employed and these have incorporated various ratios of glycol (ethylene or propylene) with other preservatives and fixatives such as formalin or ethyl alcohol (Upton and Norris 1980). A comparison of the preservation attributes for invertebrate samples  of  these chemicals, along with a number of other additives, was conducted by Schmidt et al. (2006) where they concluded  that ethylene glycol had better sampling efficiencies and conservation attributes than brine, water or ethanol.

The long time frames over which traps can be left open, particularly in remote areas, allows a cost efficient sampling method that can span the often brief and unpredictable  activity patterns of terrestrial invertebrates. Consequently our understanding of patterns of invertebrate species incidence and species richness has been dramatically improved as a result of this technique. In Western Australia wet pitfall trapping has been critical for evaluating invertebrate assemblages in DEC’s bioregional biodiversity surveys (Burbidge et al. 2000; Keighery et al. 2004; George et al. 2010) and as part of the forest biodiversity monitoring program (Department of Environment and Conservation 2006) as well as frequently being used by environmental consultants undertaking sampling for short range endemic invertebrates.

One of the undesirable consequences of wet pitfall trapping is the amount vertebrate by-catch and this has become a major ethical concern in recent years (New 1999; Thompson et al. 2008). Of particular concern to Animal Ethics Committees are the number of individual animals caught, the way they succumb within the solutions and the fact that beyond morphological identification most vertebrate samples have no other scientific value. Ethylene glycol and additives generally denatures DNA, leave vertebrates discoloured, desiccated, distorted and sometimes partially decomposed (Western Australian Museum 2007). Death is likely to take place over a prolonged time frame while the animal swims in a chemical that  is a considerable irritant and is toxic when ingested (Hall 1991).

While it is highly desirable to continue the use of wet pitfall trapping in biogeographic survey, biodiversity monitoring and environmental impact assessments due to the utility and efficiency of the technique, Animal Ethics Committees will require key ethical issues in relation to vertebrate by-catch to be addressed (Department of Environment and Conservation 2008). Specifically this work needs to address reducing the amount of vertebrate by-catch, lessen the level of distress associated with vertebrate captures and, improve the scientific value of vertebrate by-catch. Although there has been some work examining design techniques of wet pit-fall traps to reduce by-catch(e.g. Pearce et al. 2005) and some preliminary examination of physical effects of low specific gravity non irritant fluids to reduce the time taken for by-catch to reach death(Burbidge 2004), there has been no work to improve the scientific value of vertebrate by-catch.

This work will be undertaken by the WA ChemCentre and the following assessments will be used. A shortlist of candidate chemicals will be developed for use under prolonged periods of extreme climatic conditions. Examinations will be conducted to assess and control evaporation of preservative against dehydration and ensure  invertebrates and vertebrates are rapidly submerged in preservative.  Performance indicators that meet standards in taxonomic research include; mounting (thorax), flexibility (legs, wing, antennae), brittleness (appendage joints), damage, colour (pigmentation), odour (microbiological spoilage), swelling and shrinking (abdominal, thoracic). Investigations will be made on the effects of time, temperature and ethanol on the preservation of crickets. Performance indicators that satisfy requirements in molecular research include; DNA quality and PCR amplification. This will involve the use of a  kit which enables the isolation of DNA from insects. A shortlist of priming sequences will be developed based on published data. Optimum conditions will be established for the PCR amplification of invertebrate gene sequences. This process will be repeated for a model vertebrate. </p>",required,False,,not required,False,not required,,,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, OVertime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"

707,"SPPs for coral and fish community monitoring are presently in development as part of the Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP)
","The Montebello/Barrow islands are situated in the Pilbara Offshore marine bioregions (IMCRA, 1997) approximately 1,600km north of Perth.  The waters and reefs surrounding these remote islands are characterised by geomorphological and oceanographic conditions which provide a diverse range of marine habitats for a variety of both widely distributed and endemic tropical marine species.  The marine environment is generally considered to be in a relatively undisturbed condition as a result of low human usage and strict management controls on industry activities in the area. The Montebello/Barrow Islands Marine Protected Areas (MBIMPAs), incorporating the Montebello Marine Park, Barrow Island Marine Park and the Barrow Island Marine Management Area, were gazetted in 2004 and the conservation and management objectives for these reserves are expressed in the management plan for the MBIMPA.

 

The Gorgon Project (GP) which is based on Barrow Island is one of the world's largest natural gas projects and the largest single resource natural gas project in Australia's history. The plant will include three, 5 million-tonne-per-annum LNG trains, with domestic gas piped to the mainland, and a four kilometre long loading jetty for international shipping. The Gorgon Gas Development Revised and Expanded Proposal: Barrow Island Nature Reserve was approved by the Western Australian Government in September 2009 subject to a number of conditions and a commitment by the Gorgon Joint Venture participants to fund a series of conservation initiatives titled “Additional Gorgon Joint Venture Undertakings”.  A final investment decision (FID) was made by Chevron and industry partners to begin the project.

 

The GP includes a dredging program that will involved the removal and dumping of ~ 7.6M tonnes of marine sediment over a period of approximately 18 months and started in May 2010. The conditional approval for the GP included conditions for environmental compliance monitoring programs (including a marine baseline project and a ‘near-field’ marine monitoring program by Chevron) and a number of environmental offsets, one of which was a total of $2.5 M over three years to DEC to assess the potential impacts of the dredging on marine biodiversity over the broader scale of the MBIMPAs.  

 

The Gorgon Dredging Offset Monitoring Evaluation and Reporting Project (Gorgon MER) will investigate the potential impacts of the dredging and dumping activities on selected marine communities within the MBIMPAs (i.e. the ‘far-field’). The Gorgon MER project will also help inform future environmental impact assessments (EIA) by improving predictions of the spatial scale and nature of the likely impacts of dredging and dumping activities on sensitive marine communities. Additionally, this project will increase the knowledge base of the MBIMPAs.   
","<p><strong><em>Primary</em></strong></p>
<p>·         To assess the nature and extent of potential impacts of the Gorgon dredging program on the condition[1] of coral, fish and other important ecological (if appropriate[2]) communities of the MBIMPA; </p>
<p>·         To determine the cause/s, with a particular focus on dredging, dumping and re-suspension of spoil, of any changes in the condition of the above communities; </p>
<p>·         To assess the effects of potential confounding natural (e.g. cyclones, disease, predation, bleaching) and other anthropogenic (e.g. fishing) pressures on the condition of coral communities of the MBIMPA.</p>
<p>·         To assess the nature and extent of the impacts from the Gorgon dredging program on the social assets (if appropriate2) of the MBIMPA.</p>
<p><strong><em>Secondary</em></strong></p>
<p>·         To ensure that the Gorgon MER is integrated with the DEC Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP). </p>
<p>·         To ensure, where possible, that the Gorgon MER is complementary to industry compliance monitoring programs</p>
<p>·         To contribute data, as appropriate, to the development of a strategic capability for predicting the impact of dredging and dumping on shallow tropical communities.    </p>
<hr />
<p>[1]   Asset condition includes structure and functions</p>
<p>[2]   Current focus is on corals and fish but other ecological (e.g. macroalgae) and social assets should be considered. This will involve collation and assessment of existing marine habitat data in areas of interest. </p>","<p>The project addresses strategies in the following documents: </p>

The information gained from this study will also be used to inform the EIA process for the assessment of future dredging programs, in addition to augmenting WAMPP data sets that are used to support the decision process for the management of marine protected areas. A data report containing all raw data collected during each year of the project will be produced annually and archived by DEC. A final summary technical report containing all data collected over the duration of the project will be completed at the conclusion of the study. Knowledge gained from the project in the form of all reports and other communication mediums will be distributed to all relevant DEC staff. A copy of all major reports will also be forwarded to the Karratha Department of Fisheries and the Western Australian Museum. People outside of DEC will be able to gain the information obtained during the survey by contacting DEC’s Marine Science Program. A comprehensive communication component of the project will be undertaken in order to communicate the findings of the project to DEC, other marine science providers and the wider public. Science related outputs include the publication of annual data and milestone reports in addition a final summary technical report. In addition, peer reviewed journal articles will be produced. Communication outputs will also include a DEC Landscope article, an article in the local newspaper and an article in DEC’s Conservation News. Additional communication outputs will also be explored. By communicating information about and findings of the survey we will be helping to increase Western Australians’ appreciation of the need to conserve their marine environment, including the MBIMPAs. The results of the research completed will be directly relevant to the marine management performance assessment reports that the Marine Parks and Reserves Authority requires from DEC at regular intervals. Additionally, the information gained can be used by the day to day managers of the reserves in monitoring areas of high conservation significance. Managers can then target these areas during compliance and enforcement patrols, potentially resulting in increased protection of these areas.</p>","<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>The Gorgon Dredging Offset Monitoring Evaluation and Reporting Project (Gorgon MER) assess the nature and extent of potential impacts of dredging and spoil dumping activities on selected marine biodiversity assets within the MBIMPAs. The ‘Condition’ (ie structure and function) of these assets is a result of the interplay between natural, anthropogenic and climate change pressures.  The primary purpose of the Gorgon MER program is to identify undesirable changes in asset condition as a result of human pressures (expressed relative to management objectives and targets).  The Gorgon MER program must therefore be able to discern when change in recognised assets is due to human activity rather than natural variability, to offer the opportunity to mitigate pressures.</p>
<p>Within the MBIMPAs, coral and finfish communities are identified as important biodiversity assets and are the primary focus of this project. ‘Coral community’ in the context of this work is defined as the hermatypic coral component of coral reef communities, the term being commonly used to describe the myriad of flora and fauna species that are part of a coral reef ecosystem.  Hermatypic, or reef building corals provide the physical foundation of the reef structure, three dimensional habitat for other reef biota and a source of primary production.  Coral communities are a keystone community within coral reef ecosystems and their condition is identified as a key performance indicator (KPI) in Western Australia marine protected area management plans. </p>
<p>Finfish communities, in the context of this project, are defined as targeted and non-targeted reef fish assemblages associated with high relief shallow benthic habitats that are being monitored at permanent coral community GMER sites within the Montbello/Barrow Islands (MBIs).  This does not include pelagic species.  </p>
<p>The WAMMP program Asset Knowledge Reviews highlight important asset condition, pressure and management response (CPR) indicators and recommended methods to measure these indicators (Wilson and Kendrick, in prep; Simpson <em>et al</em>., in prep). In some cases, due to the potential for elevated levels of human pressures faced by assets at MBIMPAs (dredging and sedimentation), standard WAMMP methodology has been enhanced, although in no case has the standard long term dataset that has been proposed for collection, assessment and reporting been proposed to be at a lower level than the standard WAMMP criteria.</p>
<p>Benthic cover was surveyed at 26 sites throughout the MBIMPAs in December 2006 as part of an initial characterisation of coral communities within the MPAs (Bancroft, 2010). Digital video methodologies were used to collect benthic imagery over ‘fixed’ transects at each of the sites.  Digital still images were later extracted from these videos and analysed for benthic cover in the lab using the point count method (Bancroft 2010). The digital images also provide a permanent record of the benthic community. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Methods</p>
<h3>2        Site Selection Criteria</h3>
<p>The coral and finfish reviews (Simpson <em>et al.,</em> in prep; Wilson and Kendrick, in prep) identified the natural, anthropogenic and climate change pressures that are likely to influence the coral and finfish communities within the MBIMPAs.  Site locations were chosen to maximise the potential of recording change as a result of anthropogenic pressures (particularly dredging) while minimising the potential range of confounding factors.  The generic guidelines for site selection are detailed in Wilson <em>et al</em> (in prep). From 30 coral community sites established throughout the MBIMPAs, 15 sites will primarily be used for coral and finfish monitoring within the Gorgon MER (Table 1). </p>
<p>The 15 sites are located along a North South transect (See Table 1, Figure 1) with sites at increasing distance from the area of dredge activity in both north and south directions.  This will enable the monitoring of sites with a gradient of influence from the dredge plume both north and south.  </p>

<p>For the measurement of coral community dynamics, at each of the 15 sites, four replicate 50 m permanently marked transects will be established by positioning star pickets at each end of the transect.  Relocation of the transects will be aided by the use of a GPS at the surface and subsurface buoys attached to star pickets to aid locating the star pickets underwater.  To help ensure the accurate relaying of the transect lines across the length of the transect, ‘reo bars’ will be driven into the substrate at 15m, 25m and 35m along the transect and cable ties will be used to improve the relocation of the transect lines between each of the reo bars.  At each of the permanently marked sites the fish community dynamics will be measured using six unmarked non overlapping 50m transects running over the same area investigated for community dynamics.</p>

<h3>3        Coral Community</h3>
<p>Coral communities are subject to a range of natural and anthropogenic factors or ‘pressures’ that cause changes in their condition (or ‘health’) ranging from episodic, large scale natural pressures (e.g cyclonic wave damage) that result in extensive damage to coral communities, to chronic localise human pressures (e.g. diver impact on reefs).  In order to understand the extent to which one identified pressure is impacting a system it is necessary to determine the impact that other recognised pressures are having, or to design experiments which nullify those pressures.  </p>
<p>A number of natural and anthropogenic pressures have been identified as potential contributors to the change in coral communities at the MBIMPAs[2].  Monitoring information on change of each of these potential pressures is essential to identify what pressures are driving change in asset condition.</p>
<p><strong>Table 2.</strong> Identified pressures that significantly influence coral condition at MBI’s</p>
<p>Natural</p>
<p>Seawater Temperature Rise</p>
<p>Sedimentation</p>
<p>Cyclones</p>
<p>Predation</p>
<p>Anoxia</p>
<p>Disease</p>
<p>Anthropogenic</p>
<p>Sedimentation</p>
<p>Chemical Pollution</p>
<p>The natural structuring pressures of most biological systems are varied and interdependent, especially in highly biodiverse systems such as coral communities (Dambacher <em>et al.</em>, 2009; Done <em>et al</em>., 1997; Fabricius 2007, Wooldridge 2005). The variables identified in Table 2 are considered key natural pressures affecting coral community ‘health’ at sites within the MBIMPAs over time.</p>
<p>In the coral review, Simpson <em>et al.,</em> (in prep) identified eight important anthropogenic pressures that are likely to impact coral reef communities within Western Australia.  The two pressures identified in Table 2 are the key pressures that have a high probability of impacting the coral communities within the MBIMPAs.</p>
<p>The coral review suggests that rising sea temperatures, increased intensity of storms, ocean acidification and sea level rise pose the greatest potential impact to coral reef communities as a result of climate change.  Given the relatively short time frame of the project relative to the predicted rate of change associated with climate change pressures,  these threats are not considered to be a significant impact to the coral communities over the duration of the Gorgon MER.</p>
<p>Coral reef communities are complex entities made of many parts. The coral review highlighted both structural and functional indicators which were likely to respond to recognised pressures, and the Gorgon MER program therefore needs to quantify significant change in these components through the suite of methodologies being employed to monitor these communities.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><em>3.1     Structure indicators</em></h3>
<ol>
<li>Benthic cover of Live Coral,</li>
<li>Composition and diversity,</li>
<li>Size Class frequency distributions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>3.1.1    Benthic Cover__</p>
<p>The change in live coral cover against other benthic components provides a primary indicator of coral community change[3]. In the case of the Gorgon MER cover of the benthos (as a percentage) will be determined across the following categories: ‘live coral’, ‘dead coral’, ‘bleached coral’, ‘soft coral’, ‘macroalgae’, ‘turf algae’, ‘rubble’, ‘sand’, ‘CCA’ and ‘other’ to be consistent with the classification scheme used by WAMMP. </p>
<p>Surveys of the benthic community along these transects will be undertaken using digital still cameras to enable analysis of the benthic community in the laboratory while providing a permanent record for potential further investigation. For each transect digital images of quadrats will be taken every metre along one side of the transects at a height of 1m from the substrate, providing 50 images per transect which will be analysed using a point count method to determine benthic cover.  Using the point count method, 6 points will be overlayed randomly on each quadrat allowing the type of benthos underneath each point to be recorded according to the classification developed by Moore <em>et al.,</em> (in prep).  The sum of all the points (6 x 50 quadrats) provides an estimate of the benthic cover for each transect. Power analysis of the data collected, will determine the power to detect in coral cover using this sampling regime.  </p>
<p>The survey of each of these transects within each site will be repeated in November 2009 and April 2010 prior to the commencement of the dredge program in May 2010 to provide a temporal baseline for the benthic communities prior to the dredging.  Surveys will be completed biannually (November and April) for the duration of the dredging project and for a year post dredging to monitor any changes in benthic cover. </p>
<p>3.1.2    Composition and Diversity__</p>
<p>Analysis of the digital imagery taken for the assessment of benthic cover will also provide data on the diversity and composition of the coral taxonomy, morphology and benthic group composition (see Benthic Cover 22.3.1.) based on the classification scheme developed for the WAMMP monitoring program (Moore <em>et al</em>., in prep).</p>
<p>All 15 GMER sites will be surveyed twice a year (see Table 1).</p>
<p>3.1.3    Size Frequency Distribution__</p>
<p>Data on size frequency distributions (SFD) will be measured along the transects at each site.  The maximum linear dimension (‘diameter’) of colonies &gt;10mm will be measured for each individual colony intersecting the 50m x 1m belt transect.  Each transect will be filmed using stereo video methods to enable accurate measurement of coral colonies. </p>
<p>The stereo-video equipment comprises two downward facing video units secured to an aluminum frame. A light emitting diode is positioned on a rod in front of the cameras so the footage can be synchronized when it is viewed on a computer. The video units are configured to record the coral colonies from different angles. A computer program is then used to calculate the exact size of coral colonies by mathematical triangulation using two sets of video footage.</p>
<p>Colonies will be categorized into the following size classes based on the maximum colony diameter (mm): &gt;20 – 50, &gt;50 – 100, &gt;100 – 200, &gt;200 – 500, &gt;500 - 1000, &gt;1000 -2000, &gt;2000 which is largely consistent with other studies of size class frequencies (e.g. Van Woesik and Done 1997) including the Chevron baseline survey (Chevron, 2009). A subset of corals would be selected from the available taxon, where size class frequency distribution varies markedly with age (a mix of fast and slow growing corals). This would include corals found consistently across sites (e.g. Acroporidae, Lobophyllia) to allow intra and inter-site comparisons.  Where colonies are divided by partial mortality into separate areas of living tissue while maintaining structural integrity these will be considered a single colony.  </p>
<p>SFD of corals will be recorded along belt transects at 6 sites to the north and south of dredging activity annually (Table 3). </p>
<h3><em>3.2     Functional indicators</em></h3>
<p>The coral asset knowledge review (Simpson <em>et al</em>., in prep), highlighted which functional components of corals were likely to respond to recognised pressures, and where the Gorgon MER program should focus activity. These functional components of coral communities define the processes that maintain asset ‘health’ through time, without which the integrity of the community would begin to change. These three parameters are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coral Settlement</li>
<li>Coral Recruitment</li>
<li>Coral Growth and Survival</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>3.2.1    Coral Settlement</p>
<p>The abundance of coral settlers on replicate terracotta tiles attached to the substrate represents a measure of coral settlement rate (Mundy, 2000). Three sets of 4 artificial settlement tiles, ~10m apart will be attached to the natural substrate using stainless steel mounts and masonry push mount plugs (Mundy 2000). The artificial settlement surfaces (acid washed and scrubbed) will be deployed approximately 1 month prior to the predicted broadcast spawning peak in Autumn of 2012. The surfaces will be deployed onto horizontal surfaces away from coral colonies to reduce competition, and will be retrieved approximately 2 months later.  Retrieved tiles will be replaced to investigate the impact on larval supply of corals throughout the year.  Tiles will be left for up to four months at a time. </p>
<p>Retrieved tiles will be placed on a metal rod with rubber spacers between the tiles to prevent rubbing of the tiles and removal of the coral settlers.  Each rod of 12 tiles from a site will then be wrapped in bubble wrap to prevent abrasion and submerged in household bleach for 24 hrs to remove biological material before investigation of the tiles using dissecting microscopy.  Taxonomic identification based on the corallite structure (basal plates of coral skeleton) and abundance will be recorded for one of four taxonomic groups (Poritid, Acroporid, Pocilloporid or other).  Additional information including the number of polyps per settler (related to age) and location of coral settler/s on the tile will also be recorded.  </p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>Settlement tiles will be deployed at 6 sites to the north and south of the dredging activity (Table 3).</p>
<p>3.2.2    Coral Recruitment</p>
<p>A subset of digital images recorded on each transect at each site will be used to quantify coral recruitment (Heyward, in prep).  Colonies will be categorized into the following size classes based on the maximum diameter (mm): &lt;10, 10 -&lt;25, 25 -&lt;50, 50 – &lt;75 and 75 - &lt;100. Sites with similar substrate complexity will be selected (Heyward, in prep).</p>
<p>At 6 sites along a north/south oriented transect extending over the area of dredge activity (Table 3), coral recruitment will be assessed annually.</p>
<p>If time permits, in-field surveys of coral recruits &lt;100mm will be completed in situ along belt transect at subsets of each of the 4 permanent 50m transects used for the monitoring of benthic community.  At the start and end of each of the transects, a 10m x 25cm belt transect will be surveyed to provide an indication of the recruits &lt;100mm diameter.  Colonies will be measured to the nearest mm. </p>

<p>3.2.3    Growth and Survival</p>
<p>Survivorship of corals will be measured at a coral community level through the temporal assessment of changes in community cover at each site (see 2.2.1.1).  Changes in the coral cover component of benthic cover will indicate the survivorship of the coral communities along each of the transects.</p>
<p>At each of the 6 sites (Table 3) 20 <em>Porites spp</em> colonies will be cored approximately 1 year after the completion of the dredging program to determine the growth rate of these coral colonies for at least 10 years prior to, during and after the dredging project by drilling cores through the colony as detailed in Heyward et al., (2003).</p>
<h3>3.3     Natural Pressures</h3>
<ol>
<li>Seawater Temperature </li>
<li>Cyclones </li>
<li>Sedimentation</li>
<li>Coral Predation</li>
<li>Anoxia</li>
<li>Coral Disease</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>3.3.1    Seawater Temperature</p>
<p>Seawater temperature (+0.1<sup>o</sup>C) will be measured using instantaneous insitu loggers (Sensus Ultra), and will be consistent with guidelines of minimum requirements identified for measuring water temperature within WAMMP (Bancroft, in prep). The loggers provide a dual channel temperature (resolved to 0.01°C, accuracy of +/- 0.8°C) and depth (resolved to 1.5cm, accuracy +/- 30cm) feature. Loggers are fully enclosed reducing the potential for flooding and the unit provides a large memory capacity (up to 10 years memory capacity at 10min recording intervals).  Loggers will be covered by a rubber sleeve (tyre tubes) with a thin strip of stainless wire through the opening to the water pressure sensor to reduce the rate of fouling of the sensors.  </p>
<p>Loggers will be double calibrated prior to deployment and downloaded data will be post-processed to ensure data accuracy to 0.1°C.  Data will be downloaded to the Australian Institute of Marine Science (<a href=""http://data.aims.gov.au/aimsrtds/faces/map.xhtml"">http://data.aims.gov.au/aimsrtds/faces/map.xhtml</a>) for post processing together with the Meta data for each deployment.</p>
<p>Loggers will be deployed at the 7 sites at the depth of the coral communities being monitored, (Table 3). Loggers will be programed to record measurements every 10 minutes, and replaced in &lt;3months to allow regular data downloads, removal of fouling and reduce the impact of potential logger failures.</p>
<p>Sea surface temperature will also be monitored via products supplied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite and information service <a href=""http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/data_nrt/sba/current_vs_alerts.txt"">http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/data_nrt/sba/current_vs_alerts.txt</a>. Sea surface temperature records and coral bleaching alerts are available for the Montebello area. The MBI virtual station alerts provide information on a weekly basis to indicate the likelihood of a bleaching event at the MBIs.  </p>
<p>3.3.2    Cyclones</p>
<p>Monitoring of severe storm activity and in particular cyclones over the duration of the Gorgon MER project will allow the correlation of any changes in the coral community to those pressures.  Monitoring will be maintained through a range of freely available web based weather monitoring media (<a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone"">www.bom.gov.au/cyclone</a>) to record information on cyclone path, intensity and duration.  Additional information on the wave height and direction is also available from BoM (<a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/charts/viewer/index.shtml?domain=combinedW&amp;type=sigWaveHgt"">http://www.bom.gov.au/australia/charts/viewer/index.shtml?domain=combinedW&amp;type=sigWaveHgt</a>) and wind speeds (<a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/marine/wind/index.jsp"">http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/marine/wind/index.jsp</a>) will allow more detailed correlation with any changes recorded.</p>
<p>Wave buoys have been deployed in the Barrow Island port by Chevron and a request will be made for the raw data from these devices as part of the project.</p>
<p>Regular visitation to the sites by both Chevron and DEC throughout the duration of the project will also enable spot checks for the recording of any changes in the level of mechanical damage, community size structure and composition (form and taxonomic composition) that may relate to cyclone activity that has been recorded over the duration of the project.  </p>
<p>Fortnightly reports from the compliance monitoring as part of the ministerial conditions (Chevron) also provide information on the extent of any mechanical damage that may have occurred.  With this knowledge we are able to make an informed decision about the mobilisation of a field team to quantify the occurrence of mechanical damage at the GMER sites. </p>
<p>3.3.3    Sedimentation</p>
<p>Measurements of natural sedimentation associated with the influence of flood plumes and cyclones will be completed as part of the assessment of the anthropogenic sedimentation monitoring (see anthropogenic sedimentation).</p>
<p>3.3.4    Coral Predation</p>
<p>The abundance and size distribution of the coralivorous gastropod snail (<em>Drupella spp)</em> and the Crown of Thorns starfish (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) will be quantified at six sites along a north/south oriented transect extending across the area of dredge activity (Table 3). The methods used will be consistent with those generic monitoring protocols identified within the individual SPP documents (Bancroft, in prep).</p>
<p>Surveys of_ Drupella spp_ and A. planci will be conducted during the dredging program and a year after the completion of the dredging has been completed.  Reactive surveys of the either predator may also be completed if regular monitoring of other marine communities suggests that unusually large numbers are present at a site. </p>
<p>3.3.5    Anoxia</p>
<p>No direct measure of anoxia will be made in this project as the spatial and temporal nature of these events is too fine scaled for comprehensive recordings to be made under the scope of this project. However, coral monitoring sites were selected in locations subject to high flushing rates in shallow water to reduce the potential of anoxic events impacting coral and fish communities. However during periods of elevated threat levels for anoxia DEC and Chevron will be on the lookout for the results of any potential anoxia event (fish kills, coral mortality). If at anoxic event is suspected, field observations to identify coral community loss will be initiated and fish kill specimens will be sent to Brian Jones at the Pathology lab for confirmation of cause of death.</p>
<p>3.3.6    Coral Disease</p>
<p>A coral disease survey will be completed across the GMER coral reef monitoring sites using methods consistent with those for collecting data at Ningaloo (Onton <em>et al</em>., in prep) (see Table 3). At each site, three 20 x 2m belt transects will be surveyed for corals and disease in accordance with the standardized protocols developed by the Global Environmental Facility Coral Reef Targeted Research Program’s Coral Disease Working Group (Van Woesik <em>et al.,</em> 2008). This involves in-situ visual identification of hard and soft corals to lowest taxonomic level recognized or morphological group. Each colony will be counted and categorised as healthy, bleached or assigned to a disease category. Corals exhibiting compromised health states or other notable impacts (e.g. <em>Drupella</em> spp. feeding scars) will also be recorded. Disease prevalence will be expressed as the mean percentage of coral colonies affected by disease per site (number of diseased coral colonies/total number of coral colonies x 100). </p>
<p>To confirm the type of disease observed in the field, samples from infected colonies will be collected for histological examination. Samples of coral affected by disease will be collected using bone cutters or hammer and chisel and placed in seawater in labelled plastic bags. Care will be taken to ensure both normal and abnormal tissue bordering the lesion is collected. Corals will be preserved in 10% seawater buffered formalin fixative solution. Samples will later be washed with 0.9% saline, drained and embedded in 3% bacto-agar. Corals will be decalcified through ascending concentrations of up to 10% formic acid over 24 hours, then rinsed, embedded in wax, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Grocott’s methenamine silver for tissue sections where fungi is expected. The sections will be mounted on slides and were examined using a stereo light microscope at magnifications ranging from 10 to 40x. Under microscopy, lesions will be described in terms of depletion of zooxanthellae, presence of associated microbes and structure of tissue layers. Digital still photographs of the tissue sections under magnification will also be collected. </p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>At each of 6 sites (Table 3), along a north/south oriented transect extending over the area of dredge activity quantification of coral diseases will be completed at least once during the dredging program with a further assessment 6 – 12 months after the completion of the dredging program.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h3><em>3.4     Anthropogenic pressures</em></h3>
<ol>
<li>Sedimentation </li>
<li>Chemical Pollution </li>
</ol>
<p>3.4.1    Sedimentation</p>
<p>_Sediment Plume Monitoring: _The extent and duration over which an area has been covered by the dredge plume will be measured using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. True colour enhancements of MODIS images will be downloaded on a daily basis from the NASA archive (modis.gsfc.nasa.gov). The images will be reprojected into GDA94 MAGA zone 50 ready to import into DEC GIS. The extent of the plume (graded assessment), and the day length duration of the plumes coverage, which will be linked to measurements of sedimentation rate (see sedimentation rate below) will be mapped from MODIS imagery.</p>
<p>Dredging plume boundary/ies will be drawn by digitising a line around the plume (vector digital polygon) with a new polygon created for each plume that is visible. Interpretation of the plume boundary will be completed using a predetermined set of guidelines on what constitutes a plume utilising comparative imagery of the same area captured on both plume affected and plume free days. Observer variability will be checked and differences standardised. Post processing of the daily plume boundaries will be completed to determine the frequency of days any position (monitoring sites) within the MBIMPA is affected. This will involve running a hotspot analysis in ARC GIS using ADRESI software (or related software options). The direction of the plume (north or south) and the overlap with monitoring sites will also be recorded each day as a coarse assessment of the plumes potential impact on Gorgon MER sites.  </p>
<p><em>Sediment Deposition Rate: _Sediment traps will determine the relative sedimentation rate among sites and record if there is a significant change to background levels of sedimentation as a direct result of dredging activities. Three frames, &gt;10m apart, each holding 4 sediment traps per frame (mounted <sub>500 mm apart) will be deployed at each site. Sediment traps consist of 50mm diameter PVC pipe cut to 300mm lengths and placed vertically in the water column.  A length/diameter aspect ratio of 6:1 was found to be ideal for sediment trap design in a previous study of sedimentation rates in nearby coastal waters (Forde, 1985) and the minimum requirement for sediment trap studies in the review by.  Approximately 4 cm below the mouth of each sediment trap, 6 strands of 0.5 mm diameter copper wire are criss-crossed across the opening to prevent most fish and invertebrates from entering the traps and disturbing the accumulated sediments. The mouths of the sediment traps are consistently held </sub>0.75m above the substrate and each frame will be at least ~10 m apart, weighted and tied to a star picket driven into the substrate</em>.  _</p>
<p>Sediment traps will be left for 6-12 weeks before retrieval and replacement of cylinders.  On retrieval each of the cylinders will be left to stand for 24 hrs to allow the sediment to settle before the excess water is decanted from the trap using a hand pump.  The remaining contents of the traps will be transferred into sample jars and frozen for transport to the laboratory for processing.  Notes will be taken on damaged/lost traps, the level of fouling on each trap and the presence of fish in the traps.  Traps will be discarded if rate sediment deposition may have been compromised.</p>
<p>Frozen samples will be transferred to pre-weighed dishes in the laboratory and placed in a drying oven at a temperature of approximately 100<sup>O</sup>C until reaching a constant dry weight. Subsamples will also be taken to determine total organic and carbonate fraction and refractory weight for each sample. Dried samples will be stored for subsequent analysis of a range of other physical parameters which may indicate changes to sediments as a result of the extent of the plume including: Particle size analysis; X ray Diffraction (proportion aragonite, calcite and high Mg calcite); Scanning Electron Microscopy.</p>
<p>Sediment traps will be deployed at seven sites positioned both to the north and south of dredging activity (Table 2).  The traps will be retrieved and replaced every 6-12 weeks for the duration of the dredging program.</p>
<p>3.4.2    Chemical Pollution</p>
<p>Major chemical spills occurring in the MBIs in association with the industrial developments are reported as part of management procedures for the developments themselves and records of these incidences can be accessed in the event of the loss of coral potentially being associated with chemical spills.</p>
<p>Chemical pollution arising from commercial and recreational activities within the MBIMPA will be monitored throughout the life of the project.  Incidences of chemical pollution which may be detrimental to the biodiversity of the MBI’s will result in an assessment of the damage as appropriate, particularly where spills are associated with the monitoring sites.</p>
<p><strong>4     Finfish Community  </strong></p>
<p>A number of natural, anthropogenic and climate change pressures have been identified as potential contributors to the change in fish communities at the MBIs[4] (see Table 4).  Monitoring each of these potential pressures is essential to identify what pressures are driving asset changes.  </p>
<p>Of the six climate pressures identified in the review of finfish (Kendrick and Wilson, in prep) it is unlikely that even the two pressures with the greatest potential of impacting Gorgon MER sites (water temperature and increased presence and magnitude of storms) are likely to be confirmed as related to climate change in the time frame of the Gorgon MER.  However both water temperature and storm presence and magnitude will be monitored against potential affects on fish communities (see Natural Pressures 22.2.2)</p>

<p>Monitoring of the community relies on the quantification of a number of structural indicators including:  </p>
<p>1.    Total abundance</p>
<p>2.    Diversity</p>
<p>3.    Community Composition</p>
<p>4.    Size structure</p>
<p>5.    Total biomass</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>4.1.1    Fish Community Abundance, diversity and population structure</p>
<p>At each of 8 Gorgon MER monitoring sites, 6 independent 50 metre transects will be completed over the same habitat characterised for the benthic community surveys to enable fish community data to be associated with benthic structure and composition information (see Fish DOV Standard Operating Procedure).  These surveys will incorporate Diver Operated Video (DOV) methods providing a permanent record of the fish assemblage and allowing analysis of the videos in the laboratory using experienced staff (and re-analysis if necessary).  Surveys completed in 2006 were limited to quantification of the major targeted species across the 26 sites surveyed using underwater visual census methods which provides some background data for this study.  Use of stereo video equipment enables conclusive identification of species from the video footage and accurate size estimates (Harvey <em>et al.</em> 2002). </p>
<p>The stereo-video equipment comprises two forward facing video units secured to an aluminum frame. A light emitting diode is positioned on a rod in front of the cameras so the footage can be synchronized when it is viewed on a computer. The video units are configured to record the fish from different angles. A computer program is then used to calculate the exact size of fishes by mathematical triangulation using two sets of video footage. </p>
<p>At each site, video transects will be swum by a two diver team. Transects are swum in a roughly straight line (following habitat), in a direction away from the sun, with a 10 metre gap between each transect to maintain independence of replicate transects.  The first person in the fish dive team swims the Diver Operated Video (DOV) unit, with the second person following behind with a modified ‘chain man’ (i.e. cotton spool device used to measure distance swum).  Once 50 metres is reached on the ‘chain man’, the second diver gives a signal on a short rope tether separating the divers (approx 3m long), signalling the first diver that they have reached the end of the transect.  This process is repeated until all replicates are completed.  The transect should be swum with camera angled slightly downwards at 3-4<sup>o</sup> to the horizontal (the camera image has almost a half of the screen showing the benthos).  This will ensure the capture of both the pelagic and benthic fish communities within the video frame. Transects are swum at a steady rate such as to minimise fish disturbance and allow approximately 6 minutes per 50m transect (just over 1 knot, half normal walking pace)</p>
<p>Data from pre-dredge surveys will used to undertake a power analysis to determine the required number of transects needed per site using the stereo-video UVC fish survey method for the range of coral reef environments at the MBI’s. However, advice from experts in the field of stereo-video UVC and investigation into the numbers of replicates used by other researchers employing the stereo-video UVC method in Western Australian tropical reef environments (Dianne Watson pers. comm., 2007) was used to overestimate the likely number of transects required per site. The pre-dredge surveys will be used to statistically validate the number of transects needed per site (e.g. power analysis) to give a high level of statistical power to detect a desired level of relative change in community diversity/composition, fish abundance and length. </p>
<p>Surveys of fish will be completed in November 2009 and April 2010 to provide a temporal component to a pre-dredge baseline dataset.  This will be used for comparison with annual surveys of fish communities at each of the 16 Gorgon MER monitoring sites for 2011, 2012.</p>
<p><em>Image analysis</em></p>
<p>Analysis of High Definition video footage is completed in the laboratory following the completion of the fieldtrip allowing accurate identification of individuals and accurate length measurements.  Digital imagery is analysed using the seaGIS software ‘Event Measure’ and ‘Photo Measure’ (www.seagis.com.au).</p>
<p>Identification of all individuals recorded within the belt transect will be completed for initial characterisation of the fish assemblage prior to the commencement of the dredging program at each site at both spring (November 2009) and autumn (April 2010) sampling periods to provide temporal variation in fish assemblages.  A similar characterisation of fish assemblages will be completed at the conclusion of the dredging program. Analysis of subsequent videos recorded on an annual basis will be completed to trophic group, feeding guilds in addition to dominant species in order to target the indicators of change in the fish community that may occur as a result of impacts from the dredging project. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><em>4.2 Functional Indicators</em></h3>
<p>The only functional parameter that has been recommended for monitoring was recruitment.</p>
<p>4.2.1    Recruitment</p>
<p>Recruitment at each site will be assessed from the video footage taken using stereo cameras to provide a relative measure of fish recruits at each of the monitoring sites.    If time and resources permit, recruit counts will also be completed in-situ using underwater visual census methods. The recruit survey diver will accompany the DOV operator counting finfish recruits along a 1m X 50 belt transect.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>At 6 sites along a north/south oriented transect extending over the area of dredge activity (Table 3), fish recruits will be quantified annually during the dredging operations and post dredging operations to determine if there are any significant impacts of the dredge operations on the fish recruitment to the benthic communities at each of these sites.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>4.3 Natural Pressures</em></p>
<p>There are a range of natural pressures that can impact finfish communities, indirectly impacting coral communities.  Three of these are considered within the MBIMPA and are important component for monitoring within the Gorgon MER.  These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Habitat Change</li>
<li>Anoxia</li>
<li>Cyclones</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>4.3.1    Habitat Change</p>
<p>Habitat change at each of the Gorgon MER sites will be monitored through the biannual assessment of benthic cover at each of the sites (see 22.3.1.1 Benthic habitat). In addition, regular field observations in the interval between community surveys at each of the Gorgon MER sites will provide a qualitative indication of changes in habitat.  </p>
<p>4.3.2    Anoxia - See 22.3.3.5 Anoxia. </p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>4.3.3    Cyclones - See 22.3.3.2 Cyclones.</p>
<p><em>4.4       Anthropogenic Pressures</em></p>
<p>There are a range of anthropogenic pressures that can impact finfish communities indirectly impacting on coral communities. Six of these listed in the fish community knowledge review (Kendrick and Wilson in prep) are considered to have a probability of impacting the coral communities within the MBIMPA and are important component for monitoring within the Gorgon MER.  These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extractive Activities - Fishing</li>
<li>Chemical pollution</li>
<li>Water Quality</li>
<li>Habitat change</li>
<li>Introduced species</li>
</ol>
<p>4.4.1    Extractive Activities - Fishing</p>
<p>Fishing directly impacts the fish communities that characterise each of the sites being monitored altering the functional and structural characteristics of the fish community.  As a result quantifying the fishing activity at each of the sites is essential for understanding any changes occurring at the sites.</p>
<p>The location of the MBIMPA reduces the accessibility to small vessels. however, the recent increased awareness of the recreational fish resource associated with the islands has led to an  increased interest from both charter fishing vessels accessing the area, and larger independent recreational fisher vessels.  Anecdotal evidence has also suggested that there has been an increase in smaller vessels accessing the Islands, generally towed by larger vessels to and from the islands. </p>
<p>Records from the Department of Fisheries will be accessed to determine the extent of recreational, commercial and charter vessel fishing activity that is being undertaken throughout the MBIMPA.  This will provide an indication of the areas which are being targeted and the species that are being extracted at each of these areas.  This understanding will enable us to determine if changes to the coral community at monitoring sites are likely to be associated with the impacts of these extractive activities.</p>
<p>In addition data from the Customs department from flights over the area will be requested to provide additional information about the prevalence of small vessel activity throughout the MBIMPA.  This will be particularly important to determine the presence of recreational fishers at the MBI’s due to poor records of this resource.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>4.4.2    Chemical pollution</p>
<p>At the MBIMPA, the source of chemical pollution is likely to be limited to the deliberate/accidental direct discharge from industrial activities and shipping activities associated with the existing infrastructure and new industrial developments at Barrow Island (see  22.3.4.2).  </p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>4.4.3    Water Quality</p>
<p>The greatest anthropogenic threat to water quality associated with the fish community structure is the increase in turbidity associated with the dredging.  Monitoring of the dredge plume and the resulting change in sedimentation is being conducted as part of the Gorgon MER (see 22.3.4.1 Anthropogenic – sedimentation)</p>
<p>4.4.3    Habitat change</p>
<p>Habitat change due to anthropogenic pressures will be detected through the monitoring methods being applied for the benthic community cover (see 22.3.1.1 Benthic Cover).</p>
<p>4.4.4    Introduced species</p>
<p>Assessment of the fish community structure will completed at each of the Gorgon MER sites annually to quantify changes in the community structure.  It should be possible to identify the presence of any introduced fish species within surveys, although introduced pathogens or related species that cause disturbance to fish communities will be difficult to detect.</p>
<p><strong>5          Sampling Regime</strong></p>
<p>The Sampling regime for coral and fish communities and pressure field variables</p>
<p>Monitoring programs should be capable of detecting change attributable to a specific pressure, whilst allowing time for management to intervene and mitigate damaging effects on assets.  The Gorgon MER has used guidelines (Wilson <em>et al</em>. in prep) for the establishment of an appropriate sampling design to detect change in the design of the project.  Sites have been selected for the Gorgon MER project based on areas of significant coral cover that were identified in the development of a long term monitoring plan for the MBIMPA (see Table 1). These sites are characterised by high diversity and concentrated abundance of finfish due partly to the high relief and complexity that they present. </p>
<p><strong>6          Spatial Scales</strong></p>
<p>The spatial scale of the sampling program has been determined based on the placement of an array of sites of significant coral cover along a north – south transect along the eastern side of the  MBI chain providing sites with a gradient of influence from the increased turbidity associated with the dredging activities (See Figure 1). </p>
<p><strong>7          Temporal Scales</strong></p>
<p>In order to determine the most appropriate temporal scale of monitoring ecological, social and chemical-physical trends were considered (Wilson <em>et al</em>., in prep).  Planning of the sampling repetition will account for the temporal pattern of natural and anthropogenic pressures that drive variation in each indicator being measured.  In as much survey timing will also account for seasonal cycles, tidal cycles and daylight hours to minimize the influence of natural variation.</p>

<p><strong>8          Site survey design</strong></p>
<p>The survey design for the Gorgon MER reflects the presumption that the sites close the dredge activities will be impact sites due to the increased sedimentation and reduced light attenuation associated with the increased turbidity.  Due to the movement of the plume in either a northerly or southerly direction due to prevailing wind, wave and tidal conditions a subset of both impact and control sites has been allocated to each of these directions.  </p>

","The Great Western Woodlands (GWW) is an internationally significant area with great biological and cultural richness (Judd et al. 2008, Watson et al. 2008). This 16M ha region of south-western Australia arguably comprises the largest and most intact area of contiguous temperate woodland remaining on Earth. The Western Australian Government’s policy is to “better manage and protect the Great Western Woodlands and to ensure the long-term conservation of the unique natural and cultural values of this important wilderness area”. This led to the development of a conservation strategy (DEC 2010), co-ordinated by the Department of Environment and Conservation. The GWW Conservation Strategy and a review conducted by a wide range of scientists with expertise in the region (Prober et al. in press) each identified inappropriate fire regimes as a threat to the woodlands and emphasised the need for a science-based fire management regime for the area. Critical gaps in the knowledge of fire ecology for GWW woodland ecosystems are a major hindrance for ecological fire management in the region. 

The GWW supports eucalypt woodlands at very low mean annual rainfall (250-350 mm), which require fire to establish but are very slow growing. In recent decades a large part of the GWW has been burnt (Parsons and Gosper 2011) and concern has been expressed over the ecological impacts of this (DEC 2010; Prober et al. in press). Fire ecology research already undertaken in Eastern Wheatbelt Nature Reserves by a joint DEC (BCI)-CSIRO project will help resolve ecological fire management issues for mallee and mallee-heath communities in the GWW (Parsons and Gosper 2011; Gosper et al. in press), but similar information for the dominant eucalypt woodlands is urgently needed. Recent work has described historical fire intervals experienced by major plant communities in the GWW and the role of landscape features and fuels in influencing fire spread (O’Donnell et al. 2011).
","<p>The proposed project will address fire ecology and management in the globally significant GWW. Building on and collating spatially explicit vegetation and fire history data, the project will use space-for-time surveys to investigate the effects of time since fire and fire interval on assembly and recovery of plant community composition, development of ecosystem structure, and fuel dynamics. The research will deliver critical information needed for the ecological management of fire in the GWW.</p>","<p>Fire is an important process in GWW ecosystems, but inappropriate fire regimes could have a large negative impact on the region’s biodiversity. Application of ecologically appropriate fire management in the region is a significant operational and scientific challenge. Progress is being made in this area, but it is acknowledged that a lack of information on the fire ecology of the dominant woodland ecosystems is a limiting factor. The project will deliver results that can be used by DEC Regional Services staff in fire management planning which will benefit the outstanding natural values of the GWW.</p>","<p>Anticipated uses of the knowledge to be gained through this project are DEC (particularly Regional Services staff involved in fire management) and members of the Woodlands Initiative (including local government, traditional owners, industry groups and conservation organisations).

FMS have provided a shapefile of fires digitised from analysing satellite images covering the period 1972-present. This has been used to select three regions (Karroun Hill, Yellowdine and south of Parker Range) containing at least three broad times since fire (&lt; 10 yrs post-fire, 40-50 yrs post-fire and long-unburnt). In each of these regions at least 5 replicate sites have been randomly selected for each of these broad times since fire. At each site, the following will be measured:</p>
<p>·         A 50 by 50 plot will be randomly placed, marked by a steel dropper and location recorded with GPS</p>
<p>·         A bulked soil sample of the top 0-10 cm of soil will be collected from &gt; 10 subsamples scattered across the plot. CSBP will conduct analyses for Total N, ammonium, nitrate, sulphur, potassium, organic carbon, conductivity and pH.</p>
<p>·         Species-area relationships will be determined by sampling the accumulation of new vascular plant species in nested quadrats (1 x 1, 5 x 5 etc up to 50 x 50). This will also give a total species list per site</p>
<p>·         Cover of vascular plants will be obtained through measuring intercepts with a pole placed systematically at 50 plots across the plot.

1497,"<p>SP 2004-003 Management of environmental risk in perennial land use systems.</p>
<p>The Management of environmental risk in perennial land used systems project and it's components were&nbsp;developed for the Future Farm Industries Cooperative Research Centre (FFI CRC)&nbsp;by Dr Lynley Stone. I (Christine Munday) joined the project and, working initially with Dr Stone and then with other project members. I gained relevant knowledge in the development of&nbsp;the genetic risk assessment protocol, updating the weed risk protocol and&nbsp;designing the field trial guidelines.&nbsp;I also prepared and edited a number of weed risk assessments for species with agricultural potential and&nbsp;worked with a technical committee of weed and agricultural experts. This has given me a good understanding of the FFI CRC WRA system and Environmental risk strategy developed in this project.</p>
<p>The FFI CRC WRA system and supporting framework will be modified for the WA rangelands and non-indigenous&nbsp;species proposed for introduction to pastoral systems will be assessed for weed risk.</p>","<p>This project forms part of the Department of Agriculture and Food WA (DAFWA) Strategic planning for sustainable mosaic agriculture in WA project.</p>
<p>The anticipated increase in export beef markets from the&nbsp;WA rangelands, including the Kimberley and Pilbara,&nbsp;must be supported by an increase in production. Expansion of mosaic agriculture around irrigation precincts and improved rainfed forage can potentially broaden the feed base of rangeland grazing systems with the potential to improve productivity and profitability. It is proposed in the DAFWA project that species not native to the&nbsp;WA rangelands&nbsp;may be introduced for irrigated fodder production and improved forage plants (dryland). However there may be risks to the existing natural biodiversity if these species have the potential to become environmental weeds and result in a loss of biodiversity from natural environments.

728,"This plan has been developed to update previous silvicultural SPPs 1993-106 and 1993-107.
"," 

This Science Project Plan will provide information to underpin the management of karri stands in the immature stage of development (25-120 years old). Immature stands regenerated following timber harvesting and bushfire comprise more than 50 000 ha and represent around one third of the area of karri forest managed by DEC. Significant areas of regenerated karri forest have been included in conservation reserves following changes in land tenure from State forest. Regenerated karri stands have important values for future timber production, biodiversity conservation and as a store of terrestrial carbon.

 

 

There are a number of well designed experiments established under previous SPPs 1993-106 and 1993_107 that investigate the dynamics of naturally regenerated and planted stands managed at a range of stand densities. These experiments span a range of site productivity and climatic gradients in the karri forest, and have been measured repeatedly over a period of several decades (McCaw and Rayner 1995), providing important information to support and improve management practices (CALM 1997, DEC in prep.). This project will draw on existing comprehensive data sets and re-focus the work on emerging issues likely to be of growing importance in the next decade. These issues include:

 

  * climate change and declining groundwater levels  
interactions with current and emerging pests and pathogens (Robinson 2003, 2005; Robinson et al. 2004)
  * increased recognition of the role of forests in maintaining global carbon cycles
  * long-term ecological dynamics in silviculturally regenerated stands (McCaw 2006).

Total number of plots is 28. Each plot is 50 m x 50 m, with tree measurements within a 30 m x 30 m sub-plot.

<p>A further thinning is proposed for the 6 plots located north of Barker Rd which includes 2 replicates of each retained density. Second thinning will follow Silvicultural Guideline 1/92 karri thinning which species retention of 24 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> for stands with a codominant height of 45-50 m. This will result in percentage reductions in basal area of approximately 45% in the 200 stems ha<sup>-1</sup> plots, 55% in the 400 stems ha<sup>-1</sup> treatment, and 65% in the 600 stems ha<sup>-1</sup> treatment. Growth responses will be compared with plots on the southern side of Barker Rd which include unthinned controls and plots thinned once at age 13. Expression of Armillaria root disease will monitored annually in the second thinned plots to determine whether there is a change in response to thinning. A sample of stumps and trees felled and removed during second thinning will be examined in detail to assess the extent of scarring and level of infection by Armillaria.</p>

<p><strong>Sutton and Treen thinning experiments</strong></p>
<p>The Treen Brook experiment was established in 1985 in even-aged karri forest regenerated in 1933. The experimental design has four thinning densities (10 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, 15 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, 20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1 </sup>and 30 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> retained) each replicated six times, and five unthinned controls. Total number of plots is 29. Each plot is 50 m x 50 m, with tree measurements within a 30 m x 30 m sub-plot. Standard measurements include stem diameter (dbhob), height, crown radii (N, E, S, W). All plots were measured in 1985, 1988, 1990 and 1995.</p>
<p>The Sutton experiment was established in 1991 in even-aged karri-marri-jarrah forest regenerated in 1969 on a site at the lower rainfall margin of the karri distribution. The experimental design has five thinning densities in karri dominant plots (7 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, 10 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, 13 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, 16 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> and 20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> retained, ± coppice control) and unthinned controls each replicated twice. Treatments in marri dominant plots are 10 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, 15 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> and 20 m<sup>2</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> retained (all with coppice control) and unthinned controls each replicated twice. Total number of plots is 27. Each plot is 50 m x 50 m, with tree measurements within a 30 m x 30 m sub-plot. Standard measurements include stem diameter (dbhob), height, crown radii (N, E, S, W). Detailed vegetation species composition and soil data were collected at the time of establishment. All plots were measured annually between 1991 and 1997, and again in 2002 and 2010.</p>
<p>Results from periodic assessments at both sites have been collated and initial analysis undertaken. It is proposed that results from these trials will be analysed jointly and a technical report with management recommendations prepared.

712,"WAMMP Mangrove monitoring SPP
","Mangrove forests are composed of specialized plants that have range of morphological and physiological adaptations which allow them to inhabit the saline, waterlogged sediments of intertidal areas of marine and estuarine environments. Mangroves are subjected to extreme fluctuations in physical conditions (e.g. heat stress, desiccation, salinity) as a result of tidal movement. Mangroves form highly productive forests along sheltered, sedimentary coasts and estuaries where the structural complexity provided by mangrove trees and roots assist in sediment accumulation and trapping detritus (Nagelkerken et al. 2008). The concentration of plant debris within mangrove systems may support a high abundance of detritus-feeding and herbivorous fauna. Burrowing invertebrates, such as crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs, inhabit these sediments, while sessile organisms, such as algae and sponges, settle on the substrate provided by roots. Larger fauna, such as fish and reptiles, commonly enter mangrove habitats on flooding tides to utilise the food and shelter they provide. 

Mangrove forests have an important ecological function in coastal systems through stabilizing sediments and buffering coastlines from wave energy. In addition, mangroves play a role in primary production and nutrient cycling in coastal systems and may provide critical habitat for fisheries resources although the significance of this function may vary depending on the proximity of other habitats (Dorenbosch et al. 2004; Ewel et al. 1998; Zann 1996).

 

The global loss of mangrove habitat is occurring at an alarming rate, and despite recent reductions in the rate of loss, estimates suggest that as much as 25% of original mangrove cover has been lost as a direct result of human activity (Spalding et al. 2010). Much of this loss is a direct result of coastal development, pollution and land-clearing and reclamation for aquaculture. In addition, dredging and the construction of coastal defense structures can indirectly alter local hydrodynamics and lead to mangrove losses. Given the pressures placed on mangroves at a global scale, the local management and conservation of mangrove forests is imperative. 

 

Worldwide, there are 73 species of mangrove that cover approximately 152 000 square kilometers (Spalding et al. 2010). Mangroves are most diverse in tropical areas, but a relatively smaller number of species extend into cool temperate latitudes. Mangroves in Australia are distributed from Bunbury in Western Australia across the northern part of the continent and along the entire east coast to South Australia. In total, Australia has 39 species of mangrove, with the diversity dramatically decreasing with increasing latitude (Zann 1996). For example, In Western Australia extensive mangrove stands extend south to Shark Bay, but the diversity decreases from 13 species in the Kimberley to only one (Avicennia marina) in Shark Bay. 

 

The Shark Bay marine protected areas, which comprise the Shark Bay Marine Park (SBMP) (748 725 ha) and the Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve (132 000 ha), are located on the midwest coast of Western Australia (WA) and within the Shark Bay World Heritage Area (Figure 1) (CALM 1996). The World Heritage listing of Shark Bay derived in part from a range of outstanding marine conservation values, including the Hamelin Pool stromatolites, extensive seagrass meadows and the high biodiversity of the region due to its location in a zone of temperate and tropical transition (Thomson-Dans 2008). Shark Bay’s two semi-enclosed gulfs also provide a range of shallow and sheltered marine habitats that are markedly different to the adjacent typically exposed and high-energy coast.

 

The SBMP supports numerous stands of the white mangrove Avicennia marina, which are recognized as high value conservation assets (CALM 1996) These mangroves represent the southern-most substantial concentration of this species on the WA coast (Semeniuk 1993), although smaller isolated stands of A. marina occur further south in WA, at the Abrolhos Islands (ca 28º S) and in the Leschenault Estuary (ca 33º S). The Shark Bay mangroves are patchily distributed, with substantial and dense stands occurring only at some locations on the Wooramel coast, Faure Island, the Peron Peninsula and in the vicinity of South Passage. These dense mangroves occur as fringing beach vegetation, along lagoon channels and within tidal flats created by accreting sand banks (Fig. 1), and display a wide variety of morphologies. These range from stands comprising tall (>5m) trees in well established old forests, to stands comprising densely packed trees that appear to be stunted forms (Fig. 2), a condition which is not unusual in arid-zone mangroves (Alongi et al. 2005; Bhat et al. 2004; Naidoo 2010). 

 

Current knowledge about the morphological structure of mangroves in this area is low. This project will map and quantify the variation in mangrove stand morphology across a range of spatial scales. This description will include an examination of both sediment and water characteristics of a number of stands across Shark Bay, and a description of the trees in stands (e.g. density, mean height, tree diameter etc.).

","<p>This project will improve knowledge of mangroves in the SBMP by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping, describing and classifying the physical structure of major mangrove stands in the SBMP;</li>
<li>Developing and refining indicators and protocols for monitoring mangrove communities in the SBMP and other WA marine parks and reserves; and</li>
<li>Developing an understanding of the relative conservation significance of different mangrove stands in the SBMP that will inform future conservation management planning.</li>
</ul>","<p>Currently, management-related knowledge of mangroves in the SBWHA is low, and given the potential local threats to mangroves in the area, there is an urgent need to increase our understanding of this habitat. This study will provide the first quantitative knowledge concerning the structural diversity of mangrove stands in the SBWHA. The results of this project will then be used as a basis for future research projects examining a range of issues such as: the importance of mangroves in determining spatial and temporal patterns in associated assemblages such as fish, sharks, turtles and birds; the contribution of mangroves to primary productivity in the SBWHA; and, the broader ecological role of mangroves in nutrient cycling. This will aid in the management of the SBWHA through identifying areas of high diversity and conservation significance.   </p>","<p>The Department of Environment and Conservation will be the primary users of the information gained during this project. Research findings may be used by Marine Policy and Planning to determine areas of high conservation value for future planning processes. The knowledge gained from the project will be transferred directly to relevant DEC Shark Bay District staff in the form of data reports and management guidelines, which will result in better on-ground management of mangroves. In addition, the results of this project will feed into the Marine Science Program monitoring program and help to refine monitoring protocols for this asset across WA. The significance of the project will be communicated to the public through popular articles and research findings will be published in peer reviewed journals. It is anticipated that knowledge will be taken up by researchers and managers nationally and internationally.</p>","<p>Task 1: Marine Science Concept Plan (MSCP) written January 2012</p>

A number of stands have been chosen across five locations: the Wooramel coast, Faure Island, eastern Peron Peninsula, west Peron Peninsula and the Southern Passage. Each mangrove stand has been broadly classified as either as fringing (along a linear section of coast), lagoonal (present in an accreting lagoon) or fringing channels within tidal creeks (Fig. 1). These have been classified so that as wide a range of morphologies are being sampled as possible, but this description has not been designated as a factor in the analysis, as it is impossible to replicate each combination of morphologies in each location (Table 1). </p>
<p>At each site a maximum of 9 randomly selected 5 x 5m plots will be established. These will be chosen a priori by examining aerial images of each stand, and placing quadrats in areas of homogeneous cover. The number of quadrats established in each stand will be based on its size. In the field, each plot will be permanently marked for re-location. Within each plot measurements of individual trees and more general parameters will be measured. A number of physical characteristics will be measured at both the plot and individual tree level (Table 2). </p>
<p>As the objective of this study is to determine if the different stands exhibit detectable differences in structure, broad spatial patterns in mangrove morphology will be examined using a range of multivariate analyses (e.g. non-metric multidimensional scaling, Canonical Canonical discriminant analysis etc.). These analyses will determine which characteristics, or suite of characteristics, of stand structure are best able to discriminate between stand types. Regression analyses will be used to examine relationships between tree and stand characteristics and environmental parameters measured.</p>",required,False,<p>No voucher specimens will be collected during the project. </p>,not required,False,not required,<p>All raw data sheets will be archived in the DEC corporate records system and an electronic copy will be retained on the Marine Science Program server.

719,,"This project was initiated in 2003 as a collaboration between Stephen Hopper, then CEO Kings Park, and Paul Gioia, then Senior Research Scientist at WA Herbarium, DEC. The intention was to investigate the use of Herbarium specimen data in exploring patterns of plant biodiversity within Western Australia. While some studies had investigated various aspects of plant biodiversity (Lesueur, Perth, Stirling Range, Fitzgerald River, and western wheatbelt - see Brown, 1832; Diels, 1906; Speck, 1958; Hopper, 1979; Gibson et al., 1997; Hopper & Burbidge, 1990), none had used the Herbarium collection or employed the latest technology to analyse all available data across a broad scale.

If resultant analyses could be demonstrated to closely approximate true biodiversity, outputs could be used to inform further research and conservation planning.

717,,"Ocean-warming events have recently received much attention and are responsible for a significant global decline in both coral cover and diversity over the past two decades (Wilkinson et al. 1999; Wilkinson 2008). Interaction between high incident light and increased temperature induces a breakdown in the complex host-symbiont relationship, and subsequent loss of the pigment-containing symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) and resultant bleaching of the coral tissue (Glynn 1996, Fitt et al. 2001). In many instances corals are able to withstand these heat and light stresses and either recolonise or recruit zooxanthellae to the colony to effect recovery (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999). In acute instances where the heat/light stress exceeds physiological thresholds by a large margin, corals die. The spatial consequences of the heat/light stressor complex vary according to the magnitude of climatological forcing with impacts scaling from highly localised species-specific events (Fitt & Warner 1995) to ocean-basin region bleaching in anomalous extreme years (e.g. Goreau et al. 2000; Obura 2005).

 

In the past two decades, the documentation of coral bleaching on large (100s kms) to very large (1000s kms) scales has been increasing (Goreau & Hayes 1994, Berkelmans et al. 2004). It is uncertain as to whether this represents an accelerated rate in the extent and intensity of these events or whether the documentation is reaching critical mass. What is however becoming increasingly certain is that continued increases in discharge of atmospheric pollutants is causing inexorable rates of change to coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation cycles (Caldeira & Wickett 2005, Solomon et al 2009). This will likely drive up rates of incidence of temperature and related climate-driven stressors on coral reefs (Hoeke et al. 2011). The predicted impact to reef-building corals will be that deleterious physiological impacts, most notably coral bleaching, will become more widespread and severe leading to a loss of critical ecosystem resources through decreased coral community diversity (Bruno & Selig 2007, Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2007, Carpenter et al. 2008).

 

Western Australian reefs have been considered relatively resilient to coral bleaching events. Following strong El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) anomalies in 1998 there has previously been significant bleaching and recovery at Scott Reef (Smith et al. 2008, Halford and Caley 2009) and there are anecdotal reports of coral bleaching at other locations (Goreau et al. 2000). However there is no documentation of widespread coral bleaching along the WA coastline. In the summer of 2010-2011 abnormally warm water is reported to have caused extensive bleaching along the western coast of Australia. Information on coral communities gathered by DEC, DoF CSIRO and AIMS provides an opportunity to comprehensively assess the impact of this warm water anomaly on coral communities through assessments of how much coral was bleached across 11^o^ of latitude. The implications for coral reefs are explored by quantifying the spatial patterns in bleaching and subsequent post-bleaching mortality rates of corals with reference to local and regional estimates of water temperature.
","<p>The primary objective of this project is to examine the impact of significant ocean warming during 2010 /2011 summer on WA coral reefs. Specifically, this project will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the dynamics of water temperature fluctuations during the warming event at local to regional scales;</li>
<li>Quantify the spatial extent of coral bleaching across WA coral communities;</li>
<li>Investigate the post-impact response of reef corals to bleaching at local to regional scales; and,</li>
<li>Inform future management strategies addressing responses to disturbance events including refining of NOAA temperature thresholds for bleaching in WA coral reef MPAs.</li>

In 2005 DEC was the successful tenderer for the project ND001 to gather baseline biodiversity data on the Avon NRM region, partly to fill knowledge gaps and partly to inform other projects that were part of the Natural Diversity Program of the 2005 Avon Investment Plan. This project was administered by ANDA – the Avon Natural Diversity Alliance, a consortium consisting of DEC, WWF, Greening Australia and Department of Water. The other projects were:

 

  * ND001 – Baselining – collect and collate environmental data to help identify threats, priorities and gaps, and provide data to the other projects as required. Driven by DEC.
  * ND002 – Back From The Edge – largely concerned with managing threatened species and communities. Driven by DEC and WWF.
  * ND003 – Health Ecosystems - To maintain or increase the extent and integrity of priority terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Delivered by Department of Water and WWF
  * ND004 – Ecoscapes – Identifying and protecting large representative landscapes within the Avon catchment. Driven by Greening WA and DEC
  * ND005 – Our Patch and ND006 Fire Management. Didn’t have much to do with these.

 

The ND001 project contained two sub-projects – wetlands, led initially by Stuart Halse, and then later by Adrian Pinder, and terrestrial - managed by coordinating ecologist Jeff Richardson from 2006 – April, 2009, and subsequently by Paul Gioia from 2009 - 2011. This SPP describes the terrestrial component of ND001.

Biological Survey in Western Australia routinely uncovers new taxa of conservation interest (Keighery et al., 2007). The initial identification of a potential new taxon of conservation significance may result in a note in the survey report, or a formal synopsis with a conservation ranking. 

 

 

However, there is often a considerable time lag (up to 20 years) between the recognition of a potentially new taxon of conservation significance and its eventual formal taxonomic description. For example Keighery (2009) validated six species of Darwinia which up to that time were segregated under manuscript or phrase names at PERTH, to enable conservation listing (Atkins, 2005). Thus, the concerns noted by Orchard (2006) about the perpetuation and de-facto validation of such informal names, in the literature that…..""In many cases these 'temporary' names are still in use 10-15 years later"" will be addressed.

 

 

The second aim is to formalize the use of significant flora, which was adopted for the 2004-2013 Forest Management plan (Hearn et al, 2003a &b) for the next Forest Management plan. The definitions and listing will be based on those catagories adopted by the EPA (and Ministry of Planning) for portions of the Swan Coastal Plain and Whicher Range.

1483,,"<p>The Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella heinsohni) was formally differentiated from the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) in 2005 (Beasley et al., 2005). Currently, there is limited information available for the species and local population are likely to be small in size (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cagnazzi <em>et al</em>. 2010, Palmer <em>et al.</em> in press) and geographically or genetically isolated (Cagnazzi 2010). Fewer than 100 individuals of snubfin wereestimated at three sites in the tropical and sub-tropical waters of Queensland (Parra <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cagnazzi 2010). &nbsp;More recently in the NT (2008 &ndash; 2010), photo-identification surveys were undertaken in Port Essington, Cobourg Peninsula and Darwin Harbour (Palmer et al., 2010, Palmer 2010), however, there were too few data on snubfin in Darwin Harbour to support capture-recapture modelling (Palmer <em>et al.</em> submitted). In Port Essington, total abundance estimates for snubfin dolphins were highly variable across different sampling periods and varied from 136 to 222 (Palmer <em>et al</em>. submitted). In 2010, a nomination was made for the listing of this species as threatened under the EPBC Act, based on its known biological characteristics and rising pressures resulting from coastal developments and numerous industrial activities. However, the conservation status of the species could not be properly assessed due to a lack of information on the animals&rsquo; population dynamics and distribution.&nbsp; A coordinated research strategy is being developed by the Commonwealth to provide some direction and prioritisation for research to fill this information gap, leading to a better understanding of the conservation status of this species and the current threats that it faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project will begin to address these information needs by focusing on the data that already exist within WA. A primary objective of the project will be to compile and analyse these data so that they are compatible and comparable with those from other areas within the species&rsquo; range and will be available for comparison with ongoing and future research effort. This will result in a better understanding of snubfin dolphin distribution and abundance in northern Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically, the project aims to assess dolphin distribution via collation and review of existing sighting data collected across the Kimberley region between 2004-2012. The first abundance estimates at one key site in the Kimberley region (Roebuck Bay) will be analysed, extent of occurrence and area of occupancy, including integrating traditional knowledge that has been contributed by Indigenous communities through sea ranger surveys over the greater Kimberley area. To collate the data for abundance estimation, we propose to migrate survey data into DolFin, an Oracle database with Access interface that has been developed by the NT government. It has been agreed that the database technology will be made available to other states (WA and QLD) to achieve standardisation of data storage and facilitate comparisons between sites and datasets. This will enable longer-range movements and distributions to be examined across the snubfins&rsquo; range, aligning with a key priority identified by in the Commonwealth Tropical Inshore Dolphin Draft Research Strategy.</p>","<p>The project objectives are therefore to use existing data to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Provide a quantitative abundance estimate for Roebuck Bay, WA that will stand as a baseline for this population and will also enable comparison with abundance estimates of the species from sites in QLD and NT e.g. Cleveland Bay and Port Essington</p>
<p>2) Compare methods for abundance estimation (Mark-recapture versus distance sampling) and the suitability of these methods for abundance estimation of this species.</p>
<p>3) Map the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy of snubfin dolphins in the Kimberley, WA by combining traditional knowledge and dolphin sightings from Indigenous communities by integrating sea ranger and scientific survey sightings.</p>
<p>4) Integrate data into a standardised database system for the management of data and the facilitation of data sharing between jurisdictions and sites&nbsp;</p>","<p>The project will assess dolphin distribution via collation and review of existing sighting data collected across the Kimberley region between 2004-2012. This will provide an abundance estimate for snubfin dolphins in Roebuck Bay, a key asset of the proposed marine park, which can be used for future monitoring programs.&nbsp; The project will also bring a shared database to WA that is currently in use in the Northern Territory. Sharing a database and compatible data collection and analysis methods, will enable longer-range movements and distributions to be examined across the snubfins&rsquo; range, aligning with a key priority identified by in the Commonwealth Tropical Inshore Dolphin Draft Research Strategy. DPAW will have an improved understanding of a key species in the northwest including baseline data, monitoring protocol and distribution across the broader Kimberley to focus future research and monitoring effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","<p>The primary users of the knowledge gained will be within DPAW, namely the Marine Science Program and Kimberley Region. The research findings will be used to establish and inform research and monitoring of inshore tropical dolphins in the northwest for both of these groups. Traditional owners will have an interest in the outcomes as they participated in some field work.&nbsp; All data will be readily provided to TOs and to the Regions and discussions will be held to address future monitoring protocols and ongoing use of the database.&nbsp;</p>","<table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) <strong>ROEBUCK BAY</strong>-Abundance Estimation</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Survey design &amp; methods:</strong></p>
<p>Dedicated boat-based surveys have been conducted in Roebuck Bay:</p>
<p>in 2007 (April/May), 2008 (July &amp; December) using a standard zig zag line transect design (Map 1); and</p>
<p>In 2009 (May-Sept) with a total of 28 survey days completed using a standardised grid survey method (Map 2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2009 survey design used multiple grids to achieve consistent sampling effort across the full range of nearshore environments in the bay and regular parallel sweeps along the inshore 1 metre depth contour (NB: 1 metre depth contour changes with the tide) to ensure that the grid surveys were not missing significant number of dolphins between grids. Once a full set of the grids was completed a parallel sweep would follow. The order of grids was randomly selected each day but dependent on sea conditions in the survey area (Roebuck Bay). Abundance estimates will be calculated for each year (season) but inter-annual comparisons will not be made due to the difference in sampling effort and survey design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Map 1- Survey design for Roebuck Bay, Kimberley WA depicting grid of transect lines used in 2007 and 2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Map 2- Survey design for Roebuck Bay, Kimberley WA depicting grid of transect lines used in 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Observers searched ahead of the vessel (following line transect methods (Buckland, 2001) and one observer checked behind the vessel. When a sighting occurred the vessel was stopped and the distance and angle to the dolphin group was recorded, along with the GPS position of the vessel, and measurements of water depth, sea surface temperature were taken The dolphin group was approached for the purpose of photo-identification if they were approachable and did not behave evasively. The aim was to photograph all individuals in a group without compromising the survey of transect lines and grids and avoiding changing the distribution of the animals by causing responsive movement to the vessel. The grid was repeated if photo-identification occurred over a protracted period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In total, 387 nautical miles of transect lines were covered on effort resulting in snubfin sightings 64/217 (group/individuals).</p>
<p>Total effort (includes grid transects and transits between transect lines (off-effort)) 903nautical miles; snubfin sightings 139/480.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Abundance estimation methods:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Distance sampling:</em></p>
<p>Public domain programme DISTANCE v6.0 will be used to generate absolute abundance estimates (accounting for detection probability) for snubfin dolphins within the Roebuck Bay region, based on visual sightings recorded during the vessel-based surveys described above.</p>
<p>The computer software programmes DISTANCE (PB), R, and ArcGIS (PB&amp;DT) will be used for the density and abundance estimate and broad-scale spatial analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mark-recapture:</em></p>
<p>Photo-ID images for each individual dolphin with the accompanying survey and spatial information will need to be migrated into the DolFin database. This database was developed for Department of Land and Resource Management, NT and is currently used for all dolphin photo id work.&nbsp;&nbsp; CP and an experienced Research Assistant working with this team (AP) will be contracted to quality-check the photo-identification images for and enter them into the database. AP and DT will work collaboratively to ensure the quality of the data and a successful migration into the new database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To estimate abundance, the computer software programme MARK (HR&amp;LB) will be used with model types such as POPAN or Robust Design. The sighting history files will need to be constructed from the DolFin database in a binary (0,1) format that can be read by the mark-recapture software MARK. These sighting histories will indicate the presence or absence of an individual and will likely be compiled over several temporal scales (seasons and years). These binary data will be read into MARK and the models parameterised based on relevant survey design and sampling regime assumptions. Multiple models will be fitted and ranked to achieve the best abundance estimate with corresponding confidence intervals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The resulting abundance estimates and confidence intervals will be compared. This comparison will yield insights into the feasibility and robustness of each method as a candidate technique for the future monitoring of snubfin populations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>KIMBERLEY COAST</strong>- Mapping distribution</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Survey design &amp; methods</strong></p>
<p>Two broad-scale surveys were conducted by DT (2004 &amp; 2006) along the Kimberley coast:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2004 survey (Darwin to Broome 14 days) was conducted during September (4<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 18th) aboard a yacht, RV Pelican. The purpose of the survey was to investigate the presence of snubfin dolphins in riverine and estuarine habitats. Survey effort was conducted throughout all daylight hours when the vessel was motoring or sailing unless weather conditions were poor. DT, D. Cook and others on the vessel maintained a constant watch 180&ordm; ahead of the vessel from the bow, side bridge and upper bridge platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All effort, sighting, habitat, position, weather and associated data (including evidence of human activities e.g. fishing vessels, tourist vessels, pearl farming etc.) were recorded using the IFAW LOGGER software program. Group size estimates for cetaceans included best, high and low estimates. Sightings of all wildlife were recorded, and images of habitats were regularly taken. Cetaceans, turtles, sea snakes and dugong were recorded individually, and seabirds were recorded by species and flock size</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photographs of cetacean sightings were collected wherever possible. Images were also collected for human activities (i.e. fishing vessels, pearl farms, tourist vessels) and as records of habitat along river and estuarine transits. When sightings of Irrawaddy dolphins were made, the vessel would slow or stop or move closer in order to confirm identification at slow speed. Although the vessel did maintain position/distance in relation to groups of dolphins until positive identification was made, animals were not directly followed or pursued at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Groups of snubfin dolphins (7/36) were found in nearshore waters near Cape Londonderry, Anjo Peninsula, Vansittart Bay, Augustus Island and Roebuck Bay in Broome. No groups were found in the rivers surveyed (the Berkeley River, King George River and Sampson Inlet). Survey effort 125h; snubfin sightings 7/36.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2006 survey (Darwin to Broome 14 days) was conducted during May (14<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 28th) aboard a mackerel boat, the RV Rachel. The main vessel was supported by a small vessel, used to survey in shallow estuarine areas and for close work (e.g. photo-ID, biopsy). The purpose of the survey was to investigate the presence of snubfin dolphins in riverine and estuarine habitats and to obtain photo-ID records, acoustic recordings and biopsies. Search effort on the main vessel was conducted from the main deck in front &amp; sides of the bridge. Searching was conducted by two to five observers (most often four observers) using the naked eye and 7x50 Fujinon binoculars. Additional survey protocols were as noted above (2004 survey).</p>
<p>Survey effort 125h1m 1m; snubfin sightings 15/88</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A series of surveys with six coastal ranger groups were also conducted between August 2009 and June 2012. The surveys covered two broad regions &amp; the Prince Regent River:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(i) north and south of Kalumburu (Napier Broome Bay including the Drysdale River); and</p>
<p>(ii) the region from Talbot Bay through to King Sound.</p>
<p>Most surveys were supported by a large vessel while utilising small boats for survey transects during the day.&nbsp; Travelling more than 4200km in boats, a total of 392 hours of survey effort was spent looking for snubfin and Indo-Pacific Humpback dolphins as the focus species, but also recording a wide range of other species as they were encountered. &nbsp;Total snubfin dolphin sightings:7/15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ARC GIS MAPPING METHODS</strong></p>
<p>The information from these surveys will be used for distribution analysis but not for abundance estimation. Maps will be produced using ArcGIS that depict extent of occurrence and area of occupancy using existing data from scientific surveys and traditional knowledge contributed by Indigenous communities. GIS mapping the distribution (extent of occurrence and area of occupancy) using existing sighting data from surveyed areas of the Kimberley.&nbsp;</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,not required,"<p>Data will be maintained at the Marine Science Program, Science and Conservation Division, and stored on the DPaW Science and Conservation Division server (T drive) in DolFIN database, an oracle database acquired from the Northern Territory Government.</p>

723,,"With over 350 taxa in Western Australia's Southwest Botanical Province, the family Ericaceae (formerly segregated as Epacridaceae) is the fifth largest within a region that is globally recognised as a hotspot of botanical diversity (e.g. Myers et al. 2000). In common with Fabaceae, Myrtaceae and Proteaceae, the three dicot families with still greater numbers in the SWBP, Ericaceae includes many narrow-range endemics (Hopper & Gioia 2004).

Ongoing taxonomic research into the three largest Western Australian genera within the family, _Leucopogon_ R.Br., _Andersonia R.Br._ and _Astroloma_ R.Br., indicates that all include significant numbers of undescribed taxa (_c._ 80, 20 & 10 respectively), many of which are regional or local endemics. The figure for _Leucopogon_ includes members of both _Leucopogon_ s. str. and of the several taxonomic elements that currently comprise _Leucopogon s. lat._ Of the more than 200 Leucopogon taxa (formal and informal names) now listed on FloraBase (Western Australian Herbarium 1998-), the balance between _sens. str._ and _sens. lat._ is close to 50/50.

Work on a phylogenetically-based generic framework in the _Styphelia-Astroloma _clade (described above) of tribe Styphelieae will result in the recognition of several new genera and/or a much expanded circumscription of the genus _Styphelia._ This will then allow the process to begin of formally describing the numerous phrase-named taxa currently in _Leucopogon s. lat._ Many of these are of high conservation significance. In another part of the tribe _Styphelieae_ the well-supported clade _Leucopogon s. str_. also includes numerous unnamed taxa.

An informal infrageneric classification within the genus was installed by Hislop & Chapman (2007) which provided a framework within which new species could be added in a systematic way. A total of 13 new taxa have been described since that publication, 9 of which are conservation-coded (refer Hislop 2008, Hislop 2009a & Hislop 2009b). Keys have also been provided for two of the five informal groups. Elsewhere in _Styphelieae_ two new species and a new combination have been published in the genus _Acrotriche_ (Hislop 2007 & Hislop 2010), one of these species has recently been nominated for DRF status.
","<p>Within <em>Leucopogon</em> s. lat. and related genera, as well as in <em>Monotoca</em> and <em>Melichrus</em>, taxonomic research will continue with the aim of providing formal names for the still numerous members of that genus that are currently known only by phrase-names.

Many full or interim recovery plans of DRF in WA have involved translocation of nursery-grown plants. Although some of these translocations have been successful others have been more problematic. The reasons for either failure or success have sometimes been unclear. In many cases more detailed information is needed to be able to accurately determine the likelihood of both short term success, by understanding factors critical for initial establishment and reaching reproductive maturity, and long term success in terms of recruitment and establishing a viable population. The proposed translocations involve a collaboration with UWA (through the PhD student Christine Allen and a shared position with UWA Plant Biology) to further improve our understanding of seedling establishment, growth and survival by examining several factors in an experimental setup. Below further background is provided for the translocations of two threatened plants (Declared Rare Flora) that have been set up for this project.

 

 

 

_Banksia ionthocarpa_ subsp. _ionthocarpa_is confined to a single population (with 2 subpopulations), totaling less than 1000 plants, in the Kamballup region south of the Stirling Range NP. The species is classified as Endangered under the EPBC Act 1999. It occurs on gravely clay-loam over spongolite in open shrub mallee habitat. From 1999 onwards DEC has tried to establish a second population in similar habitat in Kalgan Plains Nature Reserve with limited success (less then 70 surviving out of 389 transplanted individuals). The proposed translocation will augment this newly established population with approximately 540 young seedlings (see attached map). 

 

 

 

_Acacia awestoniana_ is endemic to the northern portion of Stirling Range NP where it occurs in 3 metapopulations totalling approximately 1000 plants. The species is classified as Vulnerable under the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. It occurs in the understorey of Wandoo woodlands and along watercourses in loam or sandy loam soils overlain with pebbles. The proposed translocation will augment one of the current metapopulations with 864 young seedlings .

2601,<p>SP 2012-008 Marine Monitoring Program</p>,"<p>Assemblages of marine fish provide key ecological functions and ecosystem services. Therefore, much effort is spent managing and monitoring fish in Western Australia's network of marine reserves. Monitoring currently focuses on large conspicuous fish, however small bodied species (&lt;5cm) typically represent ~40% of all described species (Brandl et al. 2018). Moreover, many of these cryptobenthic reef fish (CRF) have not been described by science (Allen 2015) and their substantial contribution to current measures of fish diversity (a condition indicator for marine parks) and ecological significance are underestimated (Bellwood et al. 2019).</p>
<p>Short life spans of CRF suggest they are important conduits of energy transfer in marine food webs (Wilson 2004; Depczynski et al. 2007; Goatley and Bellwood 2016) and will respond more rapidly to environmental change and stressors than larger bodied counterparts (Bellwood et al. 2006). This is especially pertinent along the WA coastline, where marine heat waves have had a dramatic impact on coral (Moore et al. 2012), macroalgae (Wernberg et al. 2016) and seagrass (Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018) habitats, yet the implications for the high diversity CRF assemblages is equivocal. Furthermore, the frequency of marine heat waves is increasing (Hughes et al. 2018) and characterising the response of CRF to disturbance related changes in habitat may provide an indication of how larger bodied taxa and related ecological processes will react to climate related stressors over longer time frames (Wilson et al. 2019). Similarly, as CRF are prey of many longer-lived species targeted by WA fishers (Farmer and Wilson 2011), shifts in CRF assemblages may be indicative of trophic cascades due to changes in fishing pressure. Indeed, composition of CRF assemblages may be a valuable tool for monitoring predation and how it varies with respect to spatial management of fishing pressure in marine parks (Willis and Anderson 2003).</p>
<p>Standard visual methods of surveying fish are not suitable for monitoring CRF (Ackerman and Bellwood 2000), and whilst sampling with poisons is the preferred technique, this is not always appropriate, requires extensive time under water and is difficult to standardise among samples. Accordingly, this project will investigate an alternate method for assessing CRF assemblages which will involve the collection and analysis of water samples for fish DNA (eDNA), a non-invasive technique with the potential to detect cryptic and rare species with little effort in the field (Pikitch 2018). Standard poison and visual approaches to assessing fish assemblages will also be undertaken to compare how measures of CRF assemblage vary among techniques. By collecting data from different habitats and management zones within marine parks it is possible to assess how effectively different techniques detect change in CRF due to spatial variation in environment or management. Results from these surveys will also help identify appropriate indicator species for future monitoring.</p>
<p>The study will initially determine which technique(s) best assess diversity and abundance of CRF in Ningaloo Marine Park. Appropriate techniques will then be used throughout the states network of marine reserves to assess how CRF assemblages vary among habitats and management zones.</p>","<p>The overarching aim of this project is to quantify the diversity and composition of CRF assemblages within Ningaloo Marine Park and gain an understanding of how CRF change due to shifts in fishing pressure and habitat composition. Thus the project will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Develop appropriate methods for measuring and monitoring CRF assemblages</li>
<li>Compare CRF assemblages collected inside and outside of no-take sanctuary zones and</li>
<li>Compare CRF assemblages across a gradient of reef (habitat) types from high coral cover and complexity to reefs dominated by macroalgae with low complexity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project will initially take place in Ningaloo Marine Park, but may be extended to other parks after the first three stages are completed. This would provide a broader scale assessment of CRF assemblages from tropical to temperate biomes.</p>","<p>The project will determine appropriate techniques for monitoring CRF, comparing assemblages in fished and unfished areas to assess how spatial variation in fishing pressure influences diversity of a KPI ecological value. Thus, the study will provide an indication of marine reserve effectiveness for conserving diversity. Comparing CRF assemblages in different habitats and levels of habitat quality (e.g. % coral cover) will explore how changes in habitat due to climate related disturbances and pressures may affect fish assemblages. Findings will therefore determine the utility of CRF as indicators of environmental change and adequacy of management zones in marine reserves for capturing fish diversity and associated ecological processes. This quantitative approach will provide a basis for assessing the diversity and ecological value of CRF relative to larger bodied fishes throughout the states network of marine reserves.</p>","<p>The project will develop indicators and methodologies that can be readily incorporated into monitoring of fish assemblages in the states network of marine reserves by marine science staff. Improved understanding of the diversity and habitat associations of fishes will also help with conservation planning and projected changes to biodiversity due to climate induced shifts in habitat. Findings from the project will therefore be disseminated within DBCA via information sheets, meetings and presentations to relevant staff. As results will also be of interest to international researchers and conservationists, they will be published in peer reviewed journals, presented at conferences and circulated through social media.</p>","<table style=""width: 701px; height: 368px;"">

<p>The composition of CRF assemblages will be assessed by; icthyocide collections, underwater visual surveys and collection of water/sediment for eDNA. CRF assemblages will be sampled at six sites inside sanctuary zones and six sites within recreational zones in the Ningaloo lagoon. Within each of the sites there will be 5-6 replicate survey areas over rubble dominated benthos. This type of benthos is common at Ningaloo, and typically has high diversity and abundance of CRF (Depczynski and Bellwood 2004).</p>
<p>Underwater visual census (UVC) will be used to assess the abundance of CRF relative to more mobile species, including potential predators of CRF, that may also influence their abundance.&nbsp;UVC will be undertaken using 5-6 point counts of 5m radius at each site, recording the size and abundance of all fish species&nbsp; encountered. Following visual assessment, small plots (~0.5m<sup>2</sup>) within the UVC survey area will be enclosed using a fine mesh and fish within the enclosed area will be collected using clove oil (Depczynski and Bellwood 2004). All CRF collected will be euthanised and preserved for identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assess fish presence using environmental DNA, 5-6 replicate 1L water samples will be collected from the waters surface and 5-6 samples from just above the benthos at each site. Water samples will be filtered using 0.45&micro;m membranes on the day of collection and filters frozen at -20<sup>o</sup>C. Water has been chosen as the medium for DNA collection as it tends to contain more fish DNA than other substrates (Koziol et al. 2018). However as CRF are closely associated with the benthos we will also collect 5-6 sediment samples at each site using a 50ml syringe.</p>
<p>DNA extractions, including negative field controls, will be conducted in a dedicated DNA laboratory using automated sample preparation (QIAGEN QIAcube, Venlo, Netherlands). A single step metabarcoding approach using oligonucleotides targeting fish taxa will be used to amplify fish DNA (Stat et al. 2017) and will include both negative and positive laboratory controls.&nbsp; Resulting samples will be pooled (equimolar) into a library and sequenced using an Illunina Miseq platform (Illumina; San Diego, USA).&nbsp; All data generated through sequencing will be filtered through a series of quality control steps prior to taxonomic assignment (Stat et al. 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>ii) Variation in CRF across habitats</em></p>
<p>CRF assemblages will be assessed across a range of habitats, from healthy coral reefs, with high structural complexity to reefs dominated by canopy forming macroalgae and low levels of hard structural complexity. The extremes of this range represent two prominent and ecologically important habitat types in tropical shallow waters (Fulton et al. 2019), as well as alternate stable states that evolve due to differing exposure to disturbance and anthropogenic stressors (Hughes et al. 2010). In particular, coral dominated reefs are highly susceptible to heat stress and extensive bleaching of corals following heat stress, or gradual erosion of reef resilience due to fishing, disease and cyclones, can result in phase shifts to macroalgal dominated reefs (Hughes 1994; Graham et al. 2015). Understanding how CRF assemblages vary across this range of habitats will therefore give an indication of how fish assemblages may change due to climate and human related pressures. Identifying species unique to different habitat types will also be the basis of developing suitable indicators for monitoring the condition of CRF relative to environmental pressures. All samples will be collected using the technique identified from method comparisons as being most appropriate for collecting CRF. The habitat present within each site will be assessed using line intercept transects and structural complexity will be recorded using a combination of seascape and small scale measures relevant to fish of different body sizes (Wilson et al. 2007, 2013).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Statistical analyses</u></em></p>
<p><em>i) Method/management comparison</em></p>
<p>Data from each sample will be analysed to determine the number of species present and indices of; species, taxonomic (Warwick and Clarke 1998) and functional diversity (Mouillot et al. 2013) calculated for all replicates. How these measures of diversity differ with respect to the sampling methods (UVC, eDNA, ichthyocides), and management zones (sanctuary, general use) will be investigated using generalised additive mixed models. Method and management zones will be included in models as fixed factors and sites will be random factors. All combinations of variables will be considered in analyses and the best model will be identified using AIC and model weights (Burnham and Anderson 2010; Fisher et al. 2018).

<p><em>ii) Variation in CRF across habitats</em></p>
<p>The influence of habitat on CRF assemblages will be assessed using a combination of GAMM (Generalised additive mixed models), DistlM (Distance based linear modelling) and PCO (Principal Coordinates Analysis). The number of individuals, species, taxonomic and functional diversity will be calculated for each replicate and used as response variables in GAMM, whilst habitat measures (e.g. coral cover, macroalgal cover, complexity) will be co-variates and site a random factor. All combinations of variables will be considered using a full subsets approach (Fisher et al 2018) and the best model for explaining variation in community measures will be based on the lowest AIC value and model weights (Burnham and Anderson 2010). Differences in CRF community composition will be examined using DistlM, with habitat measures used as predictor variables and findings viewed in multivariate space using PCO.</p>",granted,False,,not required,True,granted,"<p>The raw data will be stored on MSP T drive with a full back-up stored on an external hard drive.

The south-west Australian floristic region is recognized as one of only 34 global biodiversity hotspots: those regions on earth richest in endemic species under threat. Approximately 2000 of a total of 8000 plant species in southwest Australia occur on granite outcrops or other shallow-soil environments (Hopper et al., 1997; Hopper and Gioia, 2004). Many of these species are shallow-soil endemics that have a highly fragmented and often restricted distribution. Also worldwide a large number of rare species occur in open, shallow, rocky and drought-prone environments. This suggests that shallow-soil endemics may have special adaptations to their own habitats that prevent them from establishing and being competitive in others.

 
","<p>This project aims to enhance our knowledge of the key adaptations of species endemic to shallow-soil habitats, and how these adaptations may restrict them in their distribution. This knowledge will help improve our ability to manage and restore shallow-soil ecosystems and the many rare species they contain. </p>","<p>The below mentioned outcomes summarize the conclusions on the research that I have done in this area so far, including material from as yet unpublished data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Revegetation/replanting of perennial vegetation in shallow-soil communities can only be expected to be successful when there are cracks ‘available’ to the plants’ roots in the underlying rock. This may only be the case after fire or after the death of mature individuals. Also, relatively bare areas with low native vegetation cover are unlikely to be useful for revegetation purposes (i.e. they are bare for a reason: low water supply). </li>
<li>Using glasshouse grown seedlings with relatively few and often stunted and air pruned roots may be especially problematic for revegetation purposes on shallow soils. A high investment in roots appears essential for first summer survival and glasshouse grown seedlings often have much higher shoot to root ratios.</li>
<li>Watering over summer may greatly increase survival of transplanted shallow-soil endemics as individuals that did not reach cracks with sufficient water supply before summer get another chance. However, long term establishment will be dependent on obtaining a more permanent access to a water supply</li>
</ul>",<p>Potential users include land managers and DEC staff involved in restoration of vegetation on shallow-soil communities. Results will be submitted to international journals and will be presented in both scientific and public presentations.</p>,"<ul>
<li>Continue research on shallow-soil endemics by endeavoring to attract UWA Honours and PhD students and attract funding via ARC linkages</li>
<li>Write up and submit (1) the ironstone species work on phenotypic plasticity and (2) the work on granite outcrop species </li>

Benls has been one of the most prominent recent authors in the genus Ptilotus his last publication was in (1994) _Ptilotus mitchellii _and culminated in his draft of Ptilotus for the Flora of Australia (unpublished). There has been a need for further studies into the genus in regards to newly discovered species and a review of currently named taxa. Since Benl there have been several new species named and reviews of species complexes Davis (2004, 2007 & 2010), Lally (2008, 2009 & 2010) and Bean (2010). There is the pending Flora of Australia treatment of (Amaranthaceae) which is a collaborative effort with Terena Lally (CANB) and Tony Bean (BRI). There are still other species complexes within Ptilotus that are still need of review and phrased named taxa that require formal names and descriptions.

 

 

 

While there are some old conventional dichotomous keys to _Ptilotus _there is a need for the development of up to date electronic keys to _Ptilotus _and _Gomphrena.

753,,"The focus of work for Pluto LNG Project Offset “d” is on implementing research and monitoring that is consistent with the State Government’s indicative management plan (IMP) for the Proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area (See Figure 1). As outlined in Section 7 of the IMP, while some aspects of the marine biodiversity in the proposed reserves is relatively well understood, knowledge about environmental processes and existing pressures on values of these reserves is limited. Management strategies for scientific activity within the proposed reserves include the implementation of programs to provide for monitoring and assessment of ecological processes and the levels of human impacts. Section 8.4 of the IMP outlines generic research objectives, strategies and targets, with the overarching objective of obtaining an appropriate understanding of the biodiversity and key ecological and social processes within the proposed reserves. This section also aims to promote research that improves knowledge of the reserve and the technical basis for management decisions. Similarly, section 8.5 addresses monitoring of the key ecological values at risk in, and the human usage of, the proposed reserves. It also aims to promote ecological and social monitoring that will detect changes to ecological values to inform management.

Pluto LNG Project Offset “d” involves a suite of four inter-related projects which are:

(i)      Review, assess and summarise historical data relevant to the management of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;

(ii)     Determine distribution, patterns and key processes of major marine communities and large marine fauna of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;

(iii)    Describe patterns and trends in human use in the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area; and

(iv)    Establish long-term monitoring reference sites in the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area.

 

Large amounts of marine environmental and social data have been collected by a range of agencies and industry in this area since the late 1970s. This data was collected as part of industry development approvals processes, post-approval compliance monitoring programs, State and Commonwealth Government marine research and monitoring programs, university research programs and community projects. This project concentrates on project (i) of the four projects listed above and will identify, assess and collate existing datasets in relation to the marine biodiversity and human use of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area. This information will be used to establish long-term monitoring sites, enabling assessment of trends in biodiversity asset condition, pressures acting on these assets, and the efficiency and effectiveness of management responses to these pressures. Data will be incorporated into a marine information management system to secure future access to all information (i.e. ‘one-stop shop’ approach).
","<p>Primary,</p>
<p>(i)      To identify, assess and collate existing biophysical and social datasets relevant to values listed in the IMP for the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;</p>
<p>(ii)     Construct historical time-series of relevance to the conservation of the marine biodiversity and the management of human use of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;</p>
<p>(iii)    To ensure data is summarised, archived, made accessible and broadly presented to Government, industry and the local community; and</p>
<p>(iv)    To assist the design and implementation of Pluto LNG Project Offset “d” projects (ii), (iii) and (iv).</p>
<p>Secondary,</p>
<p>(i)      To promote the standardization and uptake of historical time-series development procedures in DEC and elsewhere;</p>
<p>(ii)     To promote integration of past, current and future research and monitoring programs to ensure investment delivers effective outputs that address management requirements; and</p>
<p>(iii)    Present recommendations on further actions required to access or utilise key datasets.</p>
<hr />","<p>This project will provide an improved understanding for government, industry and the local community of historical trends in marine biodiversity asset condition and human use of this region, and the effectiveness of past management programs. It will also identify existing and potential issues and risks where future management action may be needed.</p>
<p>Consistent with the IMP, this project will provide the information, and a scientific platform, to drive future research and monitoring programs in the Dampier Archipelago area, and facilitate planning and implementation of the remaining Pluto LNG Project Offset “d” projects. Outputs and information generated through this project will further benefit regional managers through the provision of both contextual and technical information to aid in the development of coastal and marine management programs. This project will also seek to formalise and refine the methodology to construct historical time-series datasets developed by the Marine Science Program, and link in with procedures established through the Department of Environment and Conservation Science Division, Marine Science Program Information Management Strategic Plan 2011-2014 (Mayer et al. in prep).</p>
<p>Given the nature of this project it is likely that some aspects will continue through the life of the Pluto LNG Project Offset ‘D’ program. Although historical time-series data will be prepared within the allotted time period of project (i), acquisition and/or further processing of some data may be required. The final project report will include details of the work that has been completed, as well as recommendations on any further data acquisition or processing that may be of benefit.</p>

<p>Long-term, systematic and integrated marine monitoring, together with evaluation and reporting of change (MER, see Hockings et al. 2006), are key management strategies for measuring the effectiveness of MPA and marine fauna management plans. Early detection of detrimental impacts facilitates the employment of adaptive management for the conservation of marine biodiversity.</p>
<p>Monitoring the status of environmental marine assets assists the DEC to fulfil its statutory responsibilities, including biodiversity conservation. The Marine Science Program is responsible for conducting and facilitating research and MER in MPAs, as well as providing specialist marine scientific advice and a strategic marine science focus across Western Australian state waters. In the case of MER, this is occurring through the establishment and coordination of the Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP).</p>
<p>Historically, monitoring of marine assets in Western Australia has tended to rely on snap-shot surveys or surveys conducted over haphazard spatial and temporal scales, often measured in terms of half decades or less. These studies have largely been opportunistic or in response to particular concerns, which may limit their functional use for gaining knowledge of long term changes in environmental condition. The WAMMP aims to design and implement a more strategic and integrated approach to MER in WA’s marine protected areas and for threatened marine fauna.</p>
<p>The WAMMP can benefit from past research, monitoring and associated datasets. These datasets need to be;</p>
<p>(i)      identified;</p>
<p>(ii)     assessed to determine if they can inform our monitoring program of historical asset condition or pressures; and</p>
<p>(iii)    where suitable, obtained and processed into a suitable format.</p>
<p>A guideline is being prepared to provide a generic step by step process for creating historical time-series datasets and assessing them for suitability for use in the WAMMP (Bancroft &amp; Friedman, in prep).</p>
<p>Bancroft and Friedman (in prep) outlines four major stages in establishing historical time-series:</p>
<p>(i)      ‘Context setting’ to provide the background; define assets and management objective; and note relevant condition and pressure indicators, to guide the process.</p>
<p>(ii)     ‘Prospecting’ of potential datasets to identify and acquire potential datasets for use in the construction of the suite of historical time-series.</p>
<p>(iii)    ‘Data Mining’ of suitable datasets to discern the quality, suitability, rank and weighting of historical datasets selected. Typically data will be compiled from various studies where the objective, sites and methods of studies may differ.</p>
<p>(iv)    ‘Reporting’ where a ‘Quality Index’ is used to report the ‘Pedigree’ of the resulting time-series. This stage considers the suitability of parameters considered in the first three major stages described above.</p>
<p>Whilst the variability in design, accuracy, methods and approaches make statistical analysis problematic, past studies are collected as they provide important context that inform the future design and results of MER programs.</p>
<p>A key consideration in the design of this project is the development of mechanisms and approaches to facilitate the support and assistance of the various organisations that hold relevant data. In particular the ‘Prospecting’ and ‘Data Mining’ stages require the support of organisations in detailing what data they hold, provision of specification of the data, and ultimately if it is applicable and useful, provision of the data in a form that is required. Without this support this project may become ineffectual.</p>
<p>b)   Setting the Context</p>
<p>Setting the context for the project will be an important first step to focus the data identification, review and steps for assessment. Given the large amounts of data that exist, this project is not intended to capture all data on the area but rather to focus on the most relevant and applicable data for the future management of the marine reserves. Setting the context will provide this guidance.</p>
<p>The following key sources of contextual and summary information will need to be reviewed in order to define assets and management objectives, and note relevant condition and pressure indicator/s.</p>
<ul>
<li>Indicative Management Plan for the Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area (ecological and socio-economic values listed in this document, particularly those identified as key performance indicators (KPI), will guide the prioritization for data identification, acquisition and processing).</li>
<li>DEC information already compiled as part of the MPA planning process (e.g. Regional Perspectives).</li>
<li>DEC Marine Science Strategy (Simpson, 2007).</li>
<li>Strategic Plan for the Development and Implementation of the Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program: 2008-2017.</li>
<li>Asset Knowledge Reviews (AKR) for the WAMMP.</li>
<li>A practical guide for the development of historical time-series (Bancroft &amp; Friedman, in prep).</li>
<li>A Performance Assessment Framework for Marine Conservation Reserves in Western Australia (Lloyd et al. 2005 draft).</li>
<li>DEC Science Division, Marine Science Program Information Management Strategic Plan 2011-2014 (Mayer et al. in prep).</li>
</ul>
<p>The context setting process should consider a risk assessment of human pressures on ecological values and pressures (note, this will be informed by the IMP), and the monitoring methods that have been identified by DEC as showing the greatest promise for future monitoring of ecological assets. “Asset-knowledge reviews” have been undertaken by DEC for some standard MPA assets such as corals, finish, water quality etc, and these should be considered when identifying what asset condition and pressure metrics of historical data is likely to be of greatest usefulness for this project. Part of the context setting will be establishing these aspects for the ecological assets and human use settings for the Dampier area.</p>
<p>c)      Establishing Consultative Mechanisms and Organisational Support</p>
<p>It is recommended that a technical reference group be established for the life of the project to communicate project objectives, provide input on strategies, facilitate organisational buy-in and cooperation with the project including advice on relevant data availability, and processes to review and acquire historical information.</p>
<p>The technical reference group is to comprise;</p>
<ul>
<li>DEC Marine Science Program (Pluto LNG Project Offset D (i) Coordinator)</li>
<li>DEC Marine Science Program (WAMMP Coordinator )</li>
<li>DEC Regional Office representative</li>
<li>Woodside Energy</li>
<li>Dampier Port Authority</li>
<li>WA Museum representative</li>
<li>Department of Fisheries (ideally finfish research representative)</li>
<li>Australian Institute of Marine Science</li>
<li>Office of the Environmental Protection Authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>d)      Identification of Prospective Datasets</p>
<p>‘Prospecting’ of potential datasets will be required to identify studies and data that align with values and variables detailed in the IMP. Assessment of the characteristics of the studies/datasets will rank their relative usefulness and role in developing time-series datasets.</p>
<p>This step will focus on establishing what research and monitoring has been undertaken, and then assessing the relevance of that data to MPA management as set out in the IMP and AKRs. This will primarily be done through liaising with key personnel who have direct scientific research and/or monitoring experience in the study area, and secondarily through online literature and data searches utilising tools such as the DEC Library Catalogues, ‘Web of Knowledge’, ‘Google Scholar’, ‘JSTOR’ and ‘BlueNet MEST / Australian Ocean Data Network’, amongst others.</p>
<p>Key data sources/projects include;</p>
<ul>
<li>The North West Shelf Joint Environmental Management Study inventory and bibliography outputs;</li>
<li>WA Museum biological surveys including major Woodside funded project during the 1990’s;</li>
<li>AIMS activities in the Dampier Archipelago (circa 1994-2004)</li>
<li>Department of Conservation and Environment research (circa 1980’s);</li>
<li>Department of Environment water quality studies (circa early 2000’s);</li>
<li>EPA assessment information;</li>
<li>Monitoring reports to the EPA;</li>
<li>Industry monitoring activities (particularly Woodside, Dampier Port Authority);</li>
<li>Department of Fisheries research, including Catch and Effort Statistics; and</li>
<li>Remote sensing data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following identification, a refined list of datasets / studies prioritised by spatial relevance, temporal relevance and accessibility of data will drive the data sourcing phase. This list (spreadsheet) should contain adequate information and contact details to initiate data requests for each dataset. It will also form the basis of the final metadata base which lists all data/studies relevant to the management of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area.</p>
<p>e)      Sourcing Relevant Data</p>
<p>Once priority datasets have been identified, the next step will be to acquire data from custodians, and to store this data accordingly. The data will be compiled and stored as per DEC information management guidelines (Mayer et al, in prep). Given the importance of the spatial component of the datasets it is expected that the datasets will be stored and accessed using a spatially enabled database. The arrangement for data storage and access will need to be confirmed at the start of this project in liaison with DEC staff and iVEC MEST coordinator.</p>
<p>Data may not be available in a format that is easily incorporated and may require significant processing work to convert it into a usable format (i.e. hard copy data, reprocessing of imagery to obtain accurate spatial locations etc). An assessment will need to be made on the relative worth of the data against the time required to process it. Where a decision is taken to defer the incorporation of data due to the significant costs of reprocessing, the project final report will identify these datasets with recommendations on the resources and tasks required to carry out reprocessing and the potential benefits of this work.</p>
<p>Obtaining approval and acquiring data can sometimes take time and long delays in acquiring data should not delay the completion of this project. It will be important to establish a cut-off date for obtaining datasets (i.e. mid-2012), to allow the next steps of the project to be completed in accordance with the project milestones.</p>
<p>f)       ‘Mining’, Evaluation and Reporting of Data</p>
<p>This will require a review of the prioritized datasets to assess for;</p>
<p>(i)      metric and presentation;</p>
<p>(ii)     collection methods;</p>
<p>(iii)    spatial relevancy, extent and replication;</p>
<p>(iv)    temporal relevance and replication in sampling; and</p>
<p>(v)     data reliability and accuracy.</p>
<p>The project will evaluate key datasets and evaluate them against a ‘Quality Index’ (see Bancroft &amp; Friedman, in prep) to be able to report on the ‘Pedigree’ of any resulting time-series. This stage considers the suitability and reliability of the data identified. A key consideration is the compatibility of methods of past research and monitoring as this will impact on the comparability of datasets and the capacity to develop an informative time-series of the various datasets.</p>
<p>A summary report will be required that outlines the key assets and pressures. To inform future management this will include a summary of the data available, its general suitability and a basic assessment of its capacity for providing a time-series of change, and where possible, an historical time-series dataset.</p>",required,False,,not required,False,not required,"<p>Information Management Strategic Plan 2011-2014 (Mayer et al. in prep) outlines a framework for the management of scientific data from monitoring and research for DEC's Marine Science Program. Data for this project will be managed according to this plan. Data under custodianship of DEC will be stored in a future-proof standard format on a corporate DEC server using the Corporate Applications' shared application stack. The data server will be compatible to OGC standards; it will provide access to data sets using web services behind an authentication layer. Metadata will be stored alongside the data sets and harvestable via the internationally recognized CSW query standard. A further possible implementation is to store geospatially explicit datasets in the netCDF format, hosted on an opendap server such as Thredds and metadata being harvested into a GeoNetwork metadata catalogue. All of these applications are Java applets and can be run on the corporate shared application stack. There will be a small amount of customization necessary to integrate these applets within the corporate environment.

2602,"<p>SPP 2019 - 048, which is my other project</p>","<p>Southwestern Australia has experienced a changing climate over 40 years, characterised by a long-term declining trend in precipitation and increasing temperature (Bates et al. 2008), as well as acute events, including a severe drought in 2010 and a series of heatwaves in 2011 (Ruthrof et al. 2018). These stacked meteorological events, which can interact (Matusick et al. 2018) have been associated with a range of ecological responses. These include forest die-off in vulnerable parts of forest (Matusick et al. 2013; Brouwers et al. 2013a; Andrew et al. 2016; Steel et al. 2019), and flow-on effects such as increased fine fuels (Ruthrof et al. 2016), altered structure (Matusick et al. 2016), altered composition (Steel et al. 2019), shifts in fungal communities (Hopkins et al. 2018), movement of carbon from live to dead pools (Walden et al. 2019), outbreak of woodboring beetles, <em>Phoracantha semipunctata</em> (Seaton et al. 2015) and further south, an outbreak of the gum leaf skeletoniser, <em>Uraba lugens</em> (Wills and Farr 2017). &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the acute response of the forest to drought and heatwaves in 2011, a chronic decline in vegetation cover in the eastern portion of the forest ecosystem over the past decade has also been noted (Conservation and Parks Commission 2019). Previous research in the north-eastern forest suggests that key canopy species, <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em> and <em>Corymbia calophylla,</em> are susceptible to frost (Matusick et al. 2014), and, in the same region, <em>E. wandoo</em> has been undergoing a series of declines, associated with drought and increasing temperatures (Brouwers et al. 2013b). In addition, <em>E. wandoo</em> has been affected by a Buprestid beetle, <em>Cisseis fascigera</em> (Hooper and Sivasithamparam 2005; Hooper et al. 2010), which is thought to become more active in<em> E. wandoo </em>when the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) reach a particular level and trees become drought-stressed (Hooper 2009). An associated fungal pathogen is also suspected in the decline of this eucalypt (Hooper and Sivasithamparam 2005) but has not yet been identified and described. The decline in <em>E. wandoo</em> health has had flow-on effects for its phenology (Moore et al. 2016), bird use (Moore et al. 2013) and small mammal use (Moore et al. 2014). Both the acute forest die-off events in vulnerable parts of the forest, as well as chronic decline in vegetation cover, are concerning for the functioning of the forest and the biodiversity that it supports.</p>
<p>Little is known about the effects of climate change on the forest ecosystem. Without a broader understanding of the range of effects that climate change is currently having on forest ecology and functioning, we cannot predict how the forest will respond in the future. By increasing our understanding, management intervention techniques may be applied to reduce the severity of changes the forest will undergo. The recent Mid-Term Review of the Forest Management Plan 2014-23 (Conservation and Parks Commission 2019), recommends a continued focus of research towards understanding the implications of a drying climate on ecological function, biodiversity and forest health, through KPI 12: <em>Increased knowledge of trends in climate, </em>and KPI 13: <em>integrate research and monitoring programs to inform and improve climate adaptation and mitigation</em>.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is, therefore, to understand the implications of a drying climate on forest function, biodiversity and health to inform adaptation and mitigation. The project has key areas which address KPI 12 and 13 in the Mid-Term Review: 1) understand the effects of climate change type drought and wildfire on forest structure, composition and functioning, 2) investigate functioning across climatic gradients and management intervention, 3) undertake a review of ecological thinning, and 4) explore the Landis II model to map forest change over time.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Effects of drought and wildfire on structure, composition and functioning.</strong> The effects of chronic drought, acute drought/heatwave events, and wildfire (as represented by the Yarloop research sites), which have a range of prescribed burn and harvest histories, will be examined for canopy recovery, ecophysiological functioning, carbon dynamics, regeneration capacity, understorey diversity and response, and changes in ecological function.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Review of ecological thinning.</strong> Ecological thinning to enhance forest resilience to climate change has been described in a number of Mediterranean forest ecosystems. This project will examine data and literature on forest sites in the southwest that have been thinned to lower basal area and stem density to determine the potential for silvicultural intervention to increase forest resilience in a drying climate. In addition, remote indices will be used, such as i35 (Van Dongen et al. 2019) to examine the stability, or otherwise, of vegetation trajectories of thinned sites compared with adjacent unthinned sites.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Potential:&nbsp;Modelling forest change over time.</strong> Landis-II is a landscape-scale forest ecosystem model used for simulating ecological processes, including forest growth, forest succession, and disturbances (wind, fire, insect outbreaks, drought, timber harvesting). It has been used to assist forest managers and policy-makers estimate likely outcomes of alternative management strategies (Swanson 2009). Landis II was originally developed in North America in collaboration between United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Universities. However, the model has an open source platform and since development has been used successfully in forest ecosystems throughout North America, South America (Columbia and Chile), and Europe (Sweden, United Kingdom, Italy, Ukraine, and Russia). This project aims to determine changes in forest composition, landscape pattern, tree biomass, and habitat for wildlife. The projections can be made for areas as small as 5,000 and as large as 1 million hectares for time periods ranging from 50 to hundreds of years. Two catchments have been identified for a pilot study.</p>","<p>The aim of this SPP is to <em>Understand the implications of a drying climate on forest function, biodiversity and health to inform adaptation and mitigation. </em>This will be achieved through the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the impacts of climate change and extreme events on structural, compositional and functioning of the forest;</li>
<li>Undertake a desktop review of ecological thinning;</li>
<li>Investigate the use of the Landis II model to examine the implications of climate change on forest composition and management intervention techniques.</li>
</ol>","<p>This project will improve our understanding about the vulnerability of the forest to climate change, hence our ability to predict how and where the forest may change, and how management intervention could assist with mitigation and adaptation. This SPP directly addresses the Forest Management Plan Mid-Term Review KPI12, Recommendation 12: <em>That there is a continued focus of research towards understanding the implications of a drying climate on ecological function, biodiversity and forest health including considerations of treatments to improve the forests resilience in a future drier climate.</em> In addition, the SPP addresses KPI13, Recommendation 13: <em>That the Department engages and collaborates with research providers to prioritise and integrate research and monitoring programs to inform and improve climate adaptation and mitigation with the aim of meeting information needs to support the development of the next FMP</em>.</p>
<p>This SPP also aligns with the Science Strategic Plan; Theme: <em>Impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem function</em> and The Strategic Goal: <em>Impacts of climate change on biodiversity are better understood and adaptation strategies are incorporated into conservation management and planning</em>. The project will contribute to these by understanding the responses of the forest ecosystem to climate change, such as recent declines, to inform mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>The SPP also directly contributes to the Ecosystem Science Program Plan 2018-21 via: Program Approach: <em>Conduct research into the physical and ecological processes mediating the impacts of climate change and the responses of the biota to inform mitigation strategies</em> by conducting research of the responses of biota such as overstory and understory plant diversity, composition and structure, to inform mitigation strategies.</p>

<li><em> Effects of drought and wildfire on structure, composition and functioning: </em>To examine the impacts of climate change, and extreme events on the forest ecosystem, the project will utilise the Yarloop research sites to determine the responses to canopy recovery, ecophysiological functioning, carbon dynamics, regeneration, understorey diversity. There are 47 sites in this study: 10 control, unburnt sites, and 37 sites with a 2 x 2 design, made up of low and high drought vulnerability, and high and very high fire severity. The sites also have different harvest and prescribed burn histories, which have been mapped in collaboration with the FMB. Analysis undertaken will be to quantify differences between low and high drought vulnerability, and high and severe wildfire, and thus include comparison with control sites. Non-normally distributed variables will be analysed using non-parametric methods to determine the difference between groups. For others, mixed effects models, using site as a random factor, will be used. Multiple comparison tests can then be used to determine differences. This design will provide a wealth of information regarding the forest responses to drought and extreme events against the backdrop of various management interventions.</li>

One of the spectral indices available, for example, i35 (Van Dongen et al. 2019) will be used to explore the vegetation cover trajectory in thinned and unthinned (control) plots.</li>

2881,,"<p>Identifying and protecting core habitat and dispersal corridors is the cornerstone of best-practice conservation in multi-use landscapes. Globally, the conservation community is recognising that a static, fragmented protected area system is, in many cases, inadequate to conserve populations and species in large areas, over long time-scales and given current rates of environmental change (Hannah et al. 2007, Moritz and Agudo 2013). This recognition has motivated a paradigm shift in conservation thinking away from managing species at a local scale to a broader spatial and temporal perspective: managing species and ecological processes at a whole-of-landscape scale (Pressey et al. 2007) and incorporating evolutionary processes to build species&rsquo; capacity for adaptation to environmental change (Sgr&ograve; et al. 2011).</p>
<p>There are three key foci in this species&rsquo; resilience conservation approach: (i) identifying historical refugia, areas of the landscape that offer temporally stable, climatically buffered habitat that species can retreat to, persist in and expand from under changing environmental conditions, and which represent potential reservoirs of genetic diversity for adaptation to change (Moritz 2002, Byrne 2008, Byrne et al. 2008, Keppel et al. 2012); (ii) protecting key habitat in species&rsquo; current distributions; and (iii) promoting population connectivity to maintain metapopulation viability and to retain species&rsquo; evolutionary potential (Sgr&ograve; et al. 2011, Christie and Knowles 2015).</p>
<p>Frameworks exist for the identification of refugia (Keppel et al. 2012) and their incorporation into conservation planning including Australian examples (Keppel et al. 2015, Rosauer et al. 2016). Tools also exist for predicting current habitat and translating this information into the &nbsp;design of nature reserve networks (Villero et al. 2017). Efforts to characterise landscape connectivity, however, are frequently hampered by the lack of empirical data on species dispersal with which to inform mechanistic models (Huntley et al. 2010). Emerging landscape genetics approaches that quantify gene flow as a proxy for realised dispersal to assess landscape connectivity hold promise to infer dispersal corridors, but to date there has been little uptake in conservation planning, both here and internationally (Keller et al. 2015). Single-species case studies are available (Braunisch et al. 2010, Harradine et al. 2015), however, to be useful as a landscape-scale conservation prioritisation tool, connectivity expectations across a range of species with different movement characteristics and/or habitat requirements is required for robust conservation decision-making (Harradine et al. 2015).</p>
<p>Characterising the landscape features that modify or promote connectivity is critical information for landscape-scale conservation planning. Further, in much the same way that the spatio-temporal stability of refugia are assessed, the stability of species&rsquo; dispersal corridors should be evaluated under past, present and predicted future environmental conditions to inform crucial dispersal routes. Application of a spatio-temporal landscape genetics approach to multi-species conservation planning therefore represents a novel and significant advancement in this field and provides a means to move beyond a simple pattern- to process-based approach to species conservation (Sgr&ograve; et al. 2011, Moritz and Agudo 2013, Keller et al. 2015).</p>
<p>There is urgent need to apply novel landscape-scale, multi-species approaches to conservation in Australian ecosystems. More mammal species have become extinct in Australia in the last 200 years than anywhere else on Earth (Woinarski et al. 2015). Small-medium sized mammal fauna, or &lsquo;critical weight range&rsquo; mammals are recognised as being the most &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; to human-associated disturbances (McKenzie et al. 2007). Mammal extinctions are overrepresented in Australia&rsquo;s arid and semi-arid regions (Mcdonald et al. 2015). These disturbance-prone ecosystems are understudied globally, despite having high levels of biodiversity. Furthermore, systems that are dynamic over space and time provide an opportunity for understanding how spatio-temporal heterogeneity impact microevolutionary and meta-population processes.</p>
<p>The Pilbara biogeographic region in arid Western Australia is a biodiversity hotspot with high rates of species diversity and endemism (Pepper et al. 2013). This vast and ancient landscape is also economically important, with significant mineral deposits making this region a mining hotspot. This creates conflict between the actions needed to protect biodiversity and those that support economic development. In 2017, the WA Government released the Pilbara Conservation Strategy, providing a framework for initiatives that protect biodiversity, while recognising that long-term conservation will be most effective at a landscape-scale across tenure boundaries. The strategy highlights that a landscape-scale, coordinated approach to development and biodiversity conservation is critical to ensure sustainable outcomes for government, industry and the environment.</p>
<p>This project is therefore significant in bringing together key government and industry stakeholders actively engaged in conservation management in the Pilbara bioregion to identify priority conservation management areas for small-medium sized mammal fauna. The project will capitalise on existing collections; both through tissue and DNA collections and occurrence records from State and national biodiversity record databases. This Project Plan provides details about the generation and collation of high resolution genomic and spatial environmental data, and statistical analyses to investigate patterns across the major mammal groups in the Pilbara (rodents, marsupials and bats). This unique data set will provide current and historical insight into how these animals utilise the Pilbara landscape, resulting in important conservation outcomes. Furthermore, the framework developed for integrating these findings into conservation prioritisations will be applicable for conservation management globally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>This project aims to evaluate and apply novel spatio-temporal landscape genetic methods to explore historical refugia, identify current habitat and locate dispersal corridors that build evolutionary resilience for mammal fauna, essential for best-practice conservation under global change. Our approach is applied to spatial and genetic datasets assembled for eight small-medium sized mammal species. We will also incorporate datasets generated in aligned Pilbara mammal projects for an additional three species, resulting in a dataset of 11 species, including four that are endangered nationally. A key outcome is to identify strategic landscape-scale conservation priorities for habitat protection and threat management via systematic conservation planning (SCP). This project is significant in advancing new methodologies to incorporate connectivity modelling into multi-species conservation planning, identifying the major factors contributing to species landscape use and providing a framework for prioritising evolutionary resilient landscapes that can be applied to conservation management in multi-use landscapes globally.</p>
<p>We address our aims through the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate core habitat and connectivity pathways (corridors) for species under current environmental conditions by modelling habitat suitability and contemporary gene flow.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Locate key areas for persistence under changing climates by inferring locations of evolutionary refugia from population genomic data and spatial modelling of range dynamics under historical and predicted future environments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Using SCP, identify cost-effective conservation strategies to enhance and protect these areas for optimal combinations of threatened and non-threatened species.</li>
</ul>","<p>The key project outcome for this research is the development of an integrated approach to identifying and protecting dispersal corridors and core habitat in conservation planning. This knowledge product will be of significant interest and benefit to DBCA and a range of other relevant stakeholders. For example, systematic conservation prioritisation maps (incorporating historic refugia, species habitat suitability maps, landscape connectivity maps and future projections of the latter products) produced in this project will be of significant value to government and industry stakeholders. To disseminate these outcomes and ensure uptake and practicality for DBCA and other groups, we will deliver:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Presentations</em> &ndash; Findings will be disseminated through presentations at local, national and international scientific conferences. Importantly, a stakeholder workshop in year 3 of the project will bring together industry, government, indigenous and conservation groups to ensure engagement and dissemination of research findings and uptake of key recommendations. Finally, a public seminar will be held at the completion of the project to promote research outcomes to interested stakeholders and to inform the broader community.</li>
<li><em>Publications</em> &ndash; Research outcomes will be published in high-impact international peer-reviewed journals with these being open access where possible.</li>
<li><em>Recommendations/tools</em> &ndash; specific advice will be provided on the representativeness of the current conservation reserve system and priority areas for landscape conservation management action under the Pilbara Conservation Strategy. This project will more broadly assist relevant stakeholders by generating information on priority areas for mammal conservation in the Pilbara that will be used to: 1) target on-ground management actions for threat mitigation (e.g. fire, feral animal control); 2) assess potential impacts of proposed future developments and inform strategies to alleviate, mitigate or compensate for these impacts; and 3) provide an expanded knowledge base regarding the processes that maintain ecological and genetic viability, connectivity and long term resilience and persistence of Pilbara fauna.</li>
</ol>","<p>A major goal of the project is the translation of research outputs and transmission of knowledge products across anticipated users from DBCA (including regional offices), partner organisations (Murdoch University, Roy Hill Mining, WABSI, WAM, ANU, Biologic and CSIRO) and other stakeholder groups (e.g. NRM organisations, Dept Water and Environmental Regulation). Knowledge and technology transfer to groups wanting to follow our framework for integrating dispersal corridors, core habitat and refugia in conservation planning will be facilitated through publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts and presentations at conferences, public seminars and stakeholder workshops.</p>","<p><strong>Year 1 (2019 &ndash; 2020): Collate and generate data</strong></p>

<p>The Pilbara bioregion covers more than 17,800,000 hectares, with land use split primarily between pastoralism, mining, nature conservation, and indigenous reserves. The landscape is characterised by spinifex plains, rugged iron-rich ranges and deep rocky gorges. Annual rainfall varies from ~250 to 450 mm across the bioregion, mainly falling between December and March due to cyclonic events.</p>
<p><strong>Study species and genetic samples</strong></p>
<p>This project will focus on small-to-medium Pilbara mammals. Core focal species include Pilbara endemics (<em>Pseudomys chapmani, Ningaui timealeyi, Dasykaluta rosamondae </em>and<em> Planigale</em> undescribed sp. 1) and several more widespread species (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus, Sminthopsis macroura, Sminthopsis youngsoni</em> and <em>Pseudomys hermannsburgensis</em>). We will also incorporate data generated from additional DBCA projects, including <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em>, <em>Macrotis lagotis</em> and <em>Macroderma gigas.</em> There is also potential to include other species once the analytical framework has been developed.</p>
<p>Genetic datasets will be generated for the eight core focal species. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping will be carried out by Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) Pty Ltd. DArTseq is a proprietary reduced representation next-generation sequencing method, which uses restriction enzymes optimised for the target species to achieve complexity reduction (Kilian et al. 2012, Cruz et al. 2013). Following DArTseq processing, we will filter SNPs to obtain an informative set of loci for genetic analysis, using R (R Core Team 2019). This will include the use of key filters to remove sex-linked SNPs, missing data and linkage disequilibrium. We will also filter on reproducibility (calculated using DArT technical replicates), read depth and minor allele frequency.</p>
<p>Additional genetic datasets (mitochondrial DNA sequences, microsatellite genotypes) for many of the species are also available to the project and will be utilised where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental variables</strong></p>
<p>Selecting appropriate environmental attributes that represent the spatial structure of the environment in a biologically relevant way is a major challenge of landscape genomics. To select the most appropriate spatial layers relevant to each species, we will review the literature and communicate with taxon and Pilbara experts. This information will be used to develop clear hypotheses about the landscape characteristics and environmental variables likely to be important for each species. These include Digital Elevation Models (and derivatives), fire, vegetation, hydrology, substrate, herbivore pressure and climatic variables (both present and future projections).</p>
<p><strong>Statistical analyses</strong></p>
<p>The bulk of statistical analyses will be carried out in R (R Core Team 2019), supported by the resources provided by the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre (with funding from the Australian Government and the Government of Western Australia). We describe the statistical methods we will use to address the major aims of this project below.</p>
<p><em>Locate core habitat and connectivity pathways (corridors) for species under current environmental conditions by modelling habitat suitability and contemporary gene flow</em></p>
<p>Species distribution models (SDMs) will be used to predict core habitat for each species. Many statistical models exist for predicting species distributions; we will use Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) through the dismo R package (Hijmans et al. 2017, Phillips et al. 2019), as well as an ensemble approach implemented at <a href=""http://www.bccvl.org.au/"">http://www.bccvl.org.au/</a>. The results from these models will be used to create a multi-species SDM, which will be used to help weight conservation prioritisations by habitat patches that are important for a number of species. Locations with a high probability of occurrence for each species will also be used as &lsquo;nodes&rsquo; for the CIRCUITSCAPE analysis (described below).</p>
<p>Landscape genetic models incorporating increasing complexity (Isolation-By-Distance [IBD], Isolation-By-Barrier [IBB], Isolation-By-Environment [IBE] and Isolation-By-Resistance [IBR]) will be evaluated for each species. A hypothesis of IBD will be explored using the dartR package (Gruber et al. 2018), to perform mantel tests. IBD will also be used as a null hypothesis in IBR models (support for IBD vs. IBR will be determined using an information-theoretic approach).</p>
<p>IBB will be tested using Principle Coordinate Analysis and genetic clustering methods. Following best practice, we will use multiple algorithms to confirm findings (including model-free and spatially explicit algorithms). We will use Tess3R (Caye and Francois 2016), sparse non-negative matrix factorization (sNMF, implemented through LEA; Frichot and Fran&ccedil;ois 2015) and Discriminant Analysis of Principle Components (DAPC, implemented through Adegenet; Jombart 2008, Jombart and Ahmed 2011).</p>
<p>To test for IBE, we will employ a novel use of generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) to assess genetic dissimilarity-environment associations (Ferrier et al. 2007), implemented in the gdm package (Fitzpatrick et al. 2020). Site-specific environmental variables will be extracted from high resolution spatial layers for analysis of genetic connectivity drivers.</p>
<p>IBR hypotheses will be tested using the R package ResistanceGA (Peterman 2018). Spatial environmental layers will be extracted for a number of Pilbara landscape subsets, and converted into resistance surfaces. ResistanceGA uses a genetic algorithm to objectively parameterise resistance surfaces, by comparing pairwise genetic data and effective distances with maximum likelihood population effects mixed effects models. Model selection is used to determine which resistance surface/s and cost-ratio/s best fits the observed genetic data (or whether a model of panmixia or IBD better explain the data). Effective distances are calculated using random-walk commute times (equivalent to CIRCUITSCAPE resistance distance).</p>
<p>Using a GIS platform and CIRCUITSCAPE (McRae et al. 2008), these landscape genetic models will be used to inform spatially explicit resistance surfaces to visualise landscape connectivity across multiple species. We will use these surfaces to identify &lsquo;dispersal corridors&rsquo;; areas with high connectivity between habitat &lsquo;nodes&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Locate key areas for persistence under changing climates by inferring locations of evolutionary refugia from population genomic data and spatial modelling of range dynamics under historical and predicted future environments.</em></p>
<p>SNP data for the eight focal species will be used to assess whether these species experienced population contractions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and to locate refugia. SDMs will be generated using MAXENT, with the 19 bioclimatic variables in the WorldClim archive (Hijmans et al. 2005). These will then be hindcast to the Pleistocene/LGM to assess regions of stability which may have acted as refugia. To investigate if range expansions occurred and locate possible LGM refugia, we will use the rangeExpansion package (Peter and Slatkin 2013). This method looks at the genetic patterns left from successive founder events during a range expansion. The loss of low frequency alleles during founder events results in allele frequency clines, with lower frequency at the origin of expansion, and frequency increasing in the direction of the expansion. These findings/models will also be used to forecast species distributions into the future, to compare likely distributions under a number of climate scenarios.</p>
<p><em>Using Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP), identify cost-effective conservation strategies to enhance and protect these areas for optimal combinations of threatened and non-threatened species.</em></p>
<p>The findings from the two previous objectives will be used in a SCP framework to develop conservation riorities that incorporate core habitat, refuges and landscape connectivity requirements across multiple species. This will include evaluating the performance of the current reserve system in protecting important refugia and dispersal pathways, identification of suitable conservation offset locations and areas for targeted threat management.</p>
<p>This will be achieved using the conservation planning software Marxan (Ball et al. 2009), to identify areas that maximise species habitat (as well as historical and future refugia), while ensuring these patches are sufficiently connected by dispersal corridors. We will then hold a Pilbara workshop involving partner organisations and relevant stakeholders to outline our findings, and demonstrate how systematic conservation planning can be used to address management challenges. Based on the feedback of participants in this workshop, we will revise data inputs and incorporate these into our SCP framework to come up with conservation prioritisations and recommendations for the Pilbara bioregion&rsquo;s mammal fauna.</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,granted,"<p>Tissue/DNA samples will be sourced from and returned to the relevant collections (including the DBCA Biodiversity and Conservation Sciences genetics lab, the WAM and the University of Western Australia).

780,,"Genetic analysis of threatened species can provide important information to support and guide conservation management. In particular, genetic tools can be used to aid resolution of the taxonomic identity of species to determine whether they have appropriate conservation listing (e.g. Potter _et al_. 2012; Spencer _et al_. 2001), and at a population level, analysis of the genetic diversity present in extant populations informs us of the genetic ""health"" of threatened species (e.g. Eldridge _et al_. 2004; Firestone _et al_. 2000) and how this may be maintained or improved through management actions.

Our initial work will focus on the golden bandicoot (_Isoodon auratus_, listed as Vulnerable under the EPBC Act). This species is currently restricted to 4 islands in WA and several small, restricted populations in the Kimberley region on the mainland (Palmer _et al_. 2003). Two sub-species are currently recognized: _I. a. auratus_ (Kimberley Islands and mainland) and _I. a. barrowensis_ (Barrow Island); however, early molecular work based on mitochondrial DNA shows little support for this designation (Pope _et al_. 2001; Zenger _et al_. 2005). Indeed both these studies suggest that _I. auratus_ is not strongly genetically-differentiated from the common _I. obesulus_ (southern brown bandicoot), leading to uncertainty over the most appropriate conservation rating for the species (Pope _et al_. 2001; Zenger _et al_. 2005). A more recent study of the family Peramelidae using multiple mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers suggested _I. auratus_ is reciprocally monophyletic with eastern states _I. obesulus (ssp. obesulus)_, however sampling was very limited in this study and certainly warrants further investigation (Westerman _et al_. 2012)

_I. auratus_ is currently restricted to only a handful of small, isolated mainland and island populations in WA. In an effort to reduce the extinction risk to _I. auratus_ and to re-establish extinct populations a large-scale translocation program has been established by DEC Fauna Conservation, sourcing animals from the largest population of _I. auratus_ (Barrow Island, n = 60-80,000 animals (McKenzie _et al_. 1995)). Following feral animal control, golden bandicoots have been successfully translocated from Barrow Island to two additional island locations (Hermite Island, Doole Island) and to an introduced predator-free enclosure on the mainland (Lorna Glen). Monitoring at the translocation sites has shown that bandicoots have established well on Hermite Island and expanded their areas of occupancy. At Lorna Glen, bandicoots have established populations inside the fenced enclosure and doubled in number (DEC Annual Research Report, 2010-11).
","<p>In this project we aim to use genetic markers to:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>investigate whether there is genetic support for the taxonomic relationships within I. auratus (sub-species barrowensis vs. auratus) and between I. auratus and I. obesulus using multiple mitochondrial and nuclear markers;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assess the genetic diversity of I. auratus on Barrow Island, the source population for translocations, and how this is captured and maintained in translocated populations on Hermite and Doole Islands and the mainland by sampling both translocated animals and their offspring;   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>estimate effective population size of the newly-established populations and use population viability analysis (PVA) to predict their long-term trajectory. This analysis will identify whether further management intervention is required (e.g. augmentation) to boost or maintain genetic processes.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar projects on other threatened species will be developed as DNA samples become available.  </p>",<p>This project will resolve the taxonomic identity of I. auratus subspecies and of I. auratus in relation to the more common and widespread I. obesulus. If the current taxonomy is not supported this evidence may be used to support a revision of I. auratus/I. obesulus and subsequently lead to the removal of I. auratus from the threatened species list. Information on the genetic diversity and effective population size of translocated populations will provide an assessment of the success of current management actions for recovery of the golden bandicoot. Comparing attributes of this translocation program to others will help to understand what features lead to positive genetic and demographic outcomes for the species.</p>,"<p>Information from this project will primarily inform management actions for DEC Fauna Conservation and Nature Conservation groups for current and future management of I. auratus. On a broader scale, since DEC is arguably the leading organization for mammal translocations in Australia, information gained from this analysis will help inform other translocation projects across Australia and the globe. Resolving the taxonomic relationships between I. auratus and I. obesulus will also be relevant to fauna management groups in the eastern states, where I. obesulus is more widely distributed but also considered vulnerable.</p>","<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

781,"SCP 2013-007 Understanding the changing fire environment of south-west Western       Australia
","Undertaking prescribed burns in shrubland communities can be difficult, as small changes in fuel availability and weather conditions can result in sudden changes in fire behaviour (Cruz et al. 2013).The Science Project Plan will examine fuel characteristics and fire behaviour in coastal shrubland communities in south-west Western Australia. This information will assist fire practitioners to achieve objectives of prescribed fires. Currently there are no specific fire behaviour guides for prescribed burning in coastal shrublands in WA and this was highlighted as an issue by the Special Inquiry into the November 2011 Margaret River bushfire (Keelty 2012). 

**Literature Review**

Shrubland communities are widespread in south-west Western Australia, and are the predominant vegetation type in coastal areas between Geraldton and Esperance. These coastal shrublands are renowned for their flammability, yet little work has been undertaken to understand the fire behaviour of these systems. Work undertaken in other shrubland communities have found vegetation structure and fuel arrangement to be important factors affecting fire behaviour.

Soil properties, climate, topographic position and time since fire all influence the floristic composition and structure, and therefore fuel arrangement, of these shrublands (Enright 1978, Hnatiuk and Hopkins 1980, Smith 1973, Pate and Beard, Westcott 2010). For example, Westcott (2010) found topographic position to affect floristic richness and structure of Northern sandplain communities, with taller species located on the deep soils of the sand dunes, and grammioid richness to increase in the shallow-soiled swales. Similarly, the floristic composition of coastal heaths are influenced by soil properties with vegetation on podzolic soils derived from aeolian sands being floristically distinct from than those on calcareous coastal sands (Enright 1978). At the landscape scale, climatic gradients appear to affect floristic composition and richness of the shrublands (Westcott 2010).

In an attempt to classify the shrub-dominated communities in southwest WA, Beard divided shrubland communities into five types based on their structure

(1)   heath: single strata of low shrubs less than 1m tall with 5 sub-classes (i) coastal wind-pruned heaths, (ii) other heaths on coastal limestone, (iii) heaths on laterite, (iv) heaths on winter-wet sites

(2)   thicket: shrubland with two layers. The upper layer is over 1m tall either closed or dense, the lower layer generally sparse. Generally dominated by Acacia spp., Allocasuarina spp. and Melaleuca spp.

(3)   mallee heath: low shrublands of heath less than 1m with scattered taller mallee

(4)   scrub heath: shrubland with two layers. The lower layer is less than 1m tall, the upper layer is up to 6 m in height and is open. Floristic composition is heterogeneous without clear species dominance.

(5)   scrub heath with low trees

These groupings are likely to be useful in classifying the flammability of coastal shrubland communities, as the structure and fuel arrangement of shrub-dominated communities is known to influence fire behaviour. However, further work is needed to determine the relative flammability of these shrubland types and the importance of environmental variables in determining fuel arrangement and characteristics of these communities.

**Fuel arrangement**

The structure and floristic composition of shrublands can influence fire behaviour as the majority of available fuel is living vegetation, whereas in forested systems most available fuel is dead surface fuel (Plucinski et al. 2009). Furthermore, the fuel profile of shrubland communities can be spatially and temporally complex and will strongly influence the behaviour of a fire (fire spread, flame structure, residence time and fire intensity) (Gould and Cruz 2012). In shrubland communities, fuels can either be continuously distributed along the vertical dimension, or stratified into vertically separated fuel layers, depending on floristic composition and post-fire successional stage (Cruz et al 2013). In communities with stratified fuel layers, the transition of fire from one layer to the next is associated with abrupt changes in fire behaviour (Cruz et al 2013). Fuel continuity on the horizontal axis also influences fire behavior, for example, in systems with discontinuous fuels, fires may not spread unless strong winds allow flames to breach gaps in fuels.

Temporal changes in fuel loads in shrubland communities can be more complex than litter accumulation in forests and grasslands due to floristic and structural changes with time since fire (Pluncinski et al. 2009). Several studies have examined post-fire biomass accumulation and it is clear from these studies that no one model can predict post-fire fuel accumulation in shrublands. Post-fire regenerative strategies (resprouter vs non resprouter) of the dominant species at a site will influence the rate of post-fire biomass accumulation. Communities dominated by resprouting species accumulate biomass at a faster rate, in the first few years after fire, whereas communities dominated by non-sprouting species may accumulate biomass at a slower rate initially. The proportion of dead standing fuels and height of fuels can increase with time since last fire.

**Fire behaviour in shrublands**

Undertaking prescribed burns in shrub-dominated communities can be difficult because slight changes in fuel and weather can lead to dramatic changes fire behaviour (Cruz et al. 2013). Under mild conditions (high humidity and low wind speeds), shrubland vegetation may be difficult or impossible to ignite. However, once fires are able to spread, they burn with a high intensity and can be difficult to control (Pluncinski et al 2010, Cruz et al. 2013).

**Fire propagation and sustainability **

In shrubland communities, often there is a narrow range of environmental conditions that separate non-sustained propagation from sustained high intensity fire. Cruz et al. (2013) found litter fuel moisture and wind speed to be the most important variables influencing sustained fire propagation in mallee heath communities in South Australia and Western Australia. These variables interacted to determine whether a fire was sustained; when fuel moisture of litter content was low, fires could be sustained with light winds; whereas, at higher moisture contents, higher winds speeds were needed to sustain fire. Similarly Fernandez (2001) found moisture content of elevated dead fuels to influence sustainability of fuels in Portuguese shrublands.

Fuel characteristics have also been found to be an important factors influencing fire sustainability in shrubland communities. Fontaine et al (2012) found fuel age (time since fire) in shrublands north of Perth to be a strong predicator of fire propagation with fires being more likely to be sustained in older fuels. Similarly, Cruz et al. (2013) found near surface fuels to be an important factor in predicting fire sustainability.

**Rate of spread**

The rate of spread of sustained fires in shrubland communities, has often been shown to be most strongly influenced by wind speed. For example, Catchpole et al. (1998) undertook a meta-analysis of fires occurring in Australia and New Zealand heathland and shrublands and found wind speed, followed by fuel height, to be the strongest predictors of fire rate of spread. They found no influence of litter moisture content or aerial fuel moisture content. In Portuguese shrublands, wind speed, moisture content of elevated dead fuels and vegetation height have all been shown to influence fire rate of spread (Fernandes 2001). However, Fernandes (2001) suggested that height is correlated with other fuel variables such as fuel loading and bulk density and it might not be height per se that affects rate of spread. Similarly, fire rate of spread in mallee heaths has been shown to be influenced by wind speed, litter moisture content, and plant height with higher wind speed and lower litter moisture content generally resulting in faster rates of fire spread (Cruz et al. 2013). It has been suggested that the degree to which fuel moisture content influences rate of spread might be related to the continuity of fuels, where moisture content influences rate of spread in discontinuous fuels, but has less effect on more connected fuel types (Fernandes 2001). Not all studies have found a relationship between rate of speed and fire weather/fuel characteristics (e.g. Fontaine et al. 2013).

**Crowning activity**

In shrublands with stratified fuels, abrupt changes in fire behavior can occur as fire transitions from one strata to the next. As fire transitions up the fuel complex they become more intense and rate of spread increases. In mallee heaths this transition is influenced by moisture content and wind speed (Cruz et al. 2013).

<p>This project focuses on coastal shrublands between Geraldton and Esperance. The most comprehensive vegetation mapping undertaken for the study area is work by Beard et al. (2013) and the associated spatial dataset. The spatial dataset has been captured at 1:250000 scale and incorporates the work of Beard (1979a,b), Beard et al (1976), Beard and Parker (1976) and Smith (1973, 1974). This dataset will be used as an initial means of stratifying the shrublands into structural units: heath, thicket, mallee heath, scrub heath and scrub heath with low trees.</p>
<p>Fuel structure sampling</p>
<p>Pilot Study</p>
<p>An important step in understanding fire behaviour in the shrublands will be to examine the vertical and horizontal fuel characteristics of these systems. A wide range of methods have been used to sample fuel characteristics of communities. These methods range from rapid visual assessment techniques to more labour-intensive destructive sampling. A pilot study was established to examine the effectiveness a number of different techniques in assessing fuel characteristics in shrublands. The methods assessed at 7 sites were: (i) point intercept method (ii) modified line intercept method (iii) visual fuel assessment (Percent Cover Score PCS and Fuel Hazard Score FHS) and (iv) destructive sampling. The results from the pilot study indicated the most time efficient, but accurate method of sampling the elevated and near surface fuels is using the PCS visual assessment method. Due to the low fuel loading of surface fuels, current visual assessment techniques did not have enough gradation to capture variability. Therefore it was proposed that surface fuels be assessed using a visual assessment technique created by reconstructing fuel loads.</p>
<p>Fuel classification of coastal shrublands</p>
<p>A study will be undertaken to classify coastal shrubland fuels between Geraldton and Esperance. The aim of this study will be to (i) classify shrubland communities groups with similar fuel types, (ii) determine what environmental factors are influencing fuel arrangement/fuel load, and (iii) examine the influence of time since fire on fuel accumulation.</p>
<p>This study will initially use existing spatial data to locate coastal shrub-dominated communities, and then field sampling will be conducted in priority areas. Priority areas will be vegetation communities that are close to townships and other built assets, or are of high conservation value.</p>
<p>Site selection</p>
<p>Spatial analysis of the dataset of Beard et al. (2013) will be used to select vegetation communities within 50 km of the coast between Geradlton and Esperance that have shrub dominated communities by using keywords related to shrubland communities (i.e heath, thicket, mallee, scrub, shrublands, Agonis and Banksia woodland). Cleared vegetation will be removed from the spatial data using a remnant vegetation layer. Priority for study will reflect the extent of the community on DPaW managed lands, and the potential for major bushfires with significant impacts on community, economic and environmental values </p>
<p>Vegetation communities will be stratified based on fire history (time since fire &lt;5 years, 5-10 years, 10-15 years, &gt; 15 years). For sites with a time since fire &gt;10 years, data on the cover and height of the tallest stratum will recorded, so that communities can be classified according to the Australian Fuel Classification framework (Hollis et al. in review). There will be 5 replicates samples for each combination of fire history and vegetation community, where possible.</p>
<p>Fuel sampling</p>
<p>Fuel sampling of the near surface fuel and elevated fuels will be assessed using the visual assessment method Gould et al. (2011) for PCS. For surface fuels, a visual guide will be used that has been developed by reconstructing fuel loads. The height of each fuel stratum (near surface, elevated fuels will be recorded, as well as the proportion of dead material. The presence or absence of sedges and restios in the near surface fuel layer will be recorded. The FHS of elevated fuels (Gould et al. 2011) will also be recorded because Cruz et al. (2013) found it to be a good predictor of fire spread in Mallee heath systems.</p>
<p>Experimental Fires</p>
<p>Replicated experimental burns will be undertaken to determine fire weather conditions required for sustained fire propagation and to determine the relative importance of variable (fuel and fire weather) on fire behaviour (rate of spread, fire intensity, flame dimensions, spotting). Experimental fires will be undertaken in coastal shrublands and utilise planned prescribed burns which will ideally be on flat to undulating ground. Plot sizes will vary to allow testing of the effects of ignition line length, and replicated ignitions to determine thresholds for go-no go spread in different fuel types and times since fire.</p>
<p>Prior to burning, dataloggers (ibuttons) will be buried in a grid pattern (25 m spacing). These data will be used to estimate fire rate of spread and residence time. For each successful ignition attempt, fire behavior characteristics: fuel layer supporting fire spread, flame geometry (depth, height and angle), spotting activity (distance, quantity and density), will be recorded at 2 minute intervals. Where possible, opportunities will be taken to apply and evaluate new technologies such as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to record imagery of fire spread and flame characteristics. This may be done through collaboration with CSIRO Bushfire Dynamics and Applications team.</p>
<p>Wind speed and direction will be measured at 2 and 10 m above the ground using anemometers placed upwind of the plots. Air temperature and relative humidity will also be recorded. Immediately prior to each attempted ignition samples of dead and alive fuel will be collected separately for each fuel strata present and stored in airtight containers. These samples will be weighed before and after oven drying (80oC for 48 hrs) to calculate fuel moisture content.</p>
<p>Destructive sampling</p>
<p>Destructive sampling will be used to estimate fuel load (t ha-1) in each layer (litter, near surface, and elevated) using 1m2 quadrats (surface fuels and near surface and elevated fuels). For each burn, a minimum of 10 samples will be collected 30m apart with the aim of quantifying fuel load to a precision with a standard error ±15% of the mean (as per Gould et al. 2011). Each strata will be sampled separately and the mean height recorded for each strata. Fuels will be sorted into size classes (&lt;6mm, 6-10mm, 10-25mm) and oven dried for 48 hours at 80oC.</p>
<p>Visual fuel assessment</p>
<p>Visual fuel assessment will be undertaken at each site using the same methods as used for classifying the shrubland communities. For each burn area, 10 samples will be assessed with a radius of 5m.</p>
<p>Analyses</p>
<p>Fuel Classification</p>
<p>Multivariate analysis (eg PCA) will be used to explore which communities have similar fuel loads and arrangement. Further multivariate analysis will be used to explore the relative importance of environmental variables (rainfall, temperature, soil type, soil depth, geology and time since fire) in determining fuel load and arrangement. Linear regression will be used to examine patterns in fuel accumulation with time since fire</p>
<p>Fire Behaviour model</p>
<p>AIC models will be used to determine which variables account for each fire behaviour variable measured (sustained fire propagation, rate of spread, residence time). </p>",granted,False,<p>None.</p>,not required,False,not required,<p>Data will be stored on the Kensington server.</p>,,"Consolidated Funds (DEC)

2882,,"<p>The mulga rangelands of the Midwest have experienced long-term degradation from the cumulative impact of 150 years of pastoral activity (Curry, Hennig, Blood and Leighton 1994). Changing precipitation regimes and increasing temperatures also threaten to further modify the trajectory of ecological condition in these ecosystems (Nano et al. 2017), with the impact of vegetation mortality and invasive species both likely to become more pronounced in future decades. However, while the extent of degradation is widely acknowledged, it is not known whether these ecosystems have the ecological capacity to naturally recover when agricultural grazing pressures are removed or how resilient they might be to future climatic extremes.</p>
<p>Long-term monitoring datasets are crucial for identifying changes in ecosystem condition and evaluating the impact of management interventions. To this end, a range of field-based ecological data has been collected from long term monitoring plots in the WA rangelands over the past several decades, the most comprehensive being the Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS; Watson et al. 2007, Novelly et al. 2008). However, to-date little progress has been made in synthesizing these data with other long-term datasets, including remotely-sensed data, to understand past changes in rangeland condition, the diversity of present conditions and predict likely future changes. Furthermore, past monitoring programs like WARMS have been necessarily focussed the most agriculturally productive landscapes in the rangelands, rather than for the purposes of biodiversity conservation across the landscape more broadly. Therefore, this project proposes to compile a database of existing on-ground monitoring data to be used as validation data for a landscape-wide analysis of the 33-year archive of Landsat satellite imagery and other remotely sensed data.</p>
<p>This project will establish a joint research program between CSIRO and DBCA focusing on ecological monitoring and restoration technologies in the WA rangelands. DBCA legislated lands in the WA rangelands (the Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Murchison and Yalgoo IBRA regions) currently totals 8.82 million hectares including a management interest over 5.62 million hectares of land outside of the current reserve system. CSIRO now also manages 350,000 hectares on Boolardy Station in the Midwest for the purposes of operating the Murchison Radioastronomy Observatory and constructing the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope. These properties contain extensive tracts of degraded ecosystems presenting an ongoing management challenge. Therefore, both DBCA and CSIRO have an urgent need to understand the spatial extent of degradation across their combined property estates and the ecological trajectory of these systems.</p>","<ul>
<li>Deliver new insights into the functioning of rangeland ecosystems in WA, as well as tools to undertake future monitoring and evaluation of these ecosystems.</li>
<li>Develop a method to relate remote-sensing based measurement of ecosystem condition to on-ground monitoring datasets.</li>
<li>Integrate new remote sensing technologies into assessments of rangeland condition and change detection.</li>

</ul>","<p>This project will produce an archive of remote sensing products (1988 &ndash; present) that will be used to evaluate the ecological condition of vegetation communities across CSIRO and DBCA properties in the West Australian rangelands. Remotely sensed satellite imagery will be combined with high-resolution terrain data and other satellite data (synthetic aperture radar, LiDAR), climate records and management histories to make assessments of the spatial distribution of vegetation condition and disentangle the complex interactions between landform, climate and management actions. This project will also produce an analysis of long-term field monitoring data, principally WARMS data, across all DBCA and CSIRO properties in the mid-west region. This analysis will help us to provide locally-derived estimates of growth rate, recruitment and mortality for a range of long-lived woody perennial species that are key to the ongoing management of rangeland ecosystems and also directly relevant for many HIR projects in the region, including potential future HIR projects on DBCA and CSIRO properties.</p>","<p>A series of peer-reviewed publications along with conference and meeting presentations will be delivered. Presentations will also be given internally at DBCA as well as through working groups such as Land Monitor. Collaboration among a wide group of land managers, traditional owners and science agencies has been built into the project plan. Ongoing engagement with an advisory group, comprised of experts at CSIRO, DPIRD, Curtin University and DBCA, is scheduled for 6-monthly updates, and regional outreach through workshops and annual meetings has been included in the project budget. An end-of-project workshop is also scheduled to occur at Boolardy Station, where research findings along with methods and tools will be demonstrated to CSIRO staff and Wajarri representatives, along with any other interested stakeholders from the midwest region.</p>","<p>The project is split into 6 key components that will be delivered over three years.

<li><em>A method to produce maps of vegetation density/ projective foliar cover from Landsat satellite imagery (1989 &ndash; present).</em></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will develop a method to estimate projective foliar cover at 25m spatial resolution from Landsat satellite imagery. By training a machine-learning regression model with high-resolution imagery derived from either satellite or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), we will be able to estimate projective foliar cover (PFC) from Landsat imagery. Initially, maps of PFC for all of Boolardy will be produced using annual dry-season Landsat mosaics, with the resulting maps and methodology published as a stand-alone peer-reviewed paper. Once completed, we will then apply this method to imagery captured at a higher temporal frequency (16 days or monthly) at Boolardy as well as the other DBCA managed properties in the mid-west region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><em>A model to predict ecological dynamics and recovery in mulga rangelands</em></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will use the time-series maps of vegetation cover (produced above) at Boolardy and potentially other properties to determine the drivers of change in projective foliar cover (PFC) over time. The importance of precipitation and terrain attributes along with initial (starting) cover on the year-to-year change in PFC will be tested using mixed-effects and regression-tree models. Analyses will be stratified by land system. This analysis will help us to identify areas that are showing evidence of natural recovery and determine how responsive landscape positions and/or vegetation communities are to seasonal variation.</p>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maps of projective foliar cover (PFC) are limited to estimating two-dimensional structure of vegetation communities, as optical satellite remote sensing does not provide any information on the vegetation height or other measures of structural diversity. We will test the capability of using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the Sentinal-1 satellite platform to estimate the structure of vegetation communities at Boolardy Station. Satellite data will be validated against 45cm and 12.5cm point-cloud data obtained from CSIRO as well as field-collected data from WARMS and Ausplot sites. If successful, this approach will help us to distinguish among vegetation communities based on both PFC and structural attributes using satellite remote sensing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term datasets that measure the growth of individual plants in the rangelands are exceptionally rare. Furthermore, estimates of potential growth rates for individual species are typically based on sparse observations, sometimes from regions and locations far removed from specific sites of interest. Current interest in the regeneration of <em>Acacia </em>woodlands and shrublands in the West Australian rangelands, including Human Induced Regeneration (HIR) projects, are predicated on an assumption that these ecosystems can achieve height-based thresholds. The WARMS database for sites located on DBCA and CSIRO properties will help us to provide locally-derived estimates of growth rate for a range of long-lived woody perennial species that are directly relevant for many HIR projects in the region, including potential future HIR projects on DBCA and CSIRO properties.</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,not required,"<p>Metadata will be stored on the DBCA data catalogue.

2010_011 Fire regimes and impacts in transitional woodlands and shrublands

2012_036 Fire behavior and fuel dynamics in coastal shrublands
","Fire environment is the resultant effect of factors that influence the ignition, behaviour and extent of fires in a landscape. These factors include climate and weather, topography, vegetation and fuel, and ignition. The fire environment provides a setting within which a range of fire regimes, defined by the frequency, season and intensity of burning are enacted in response to a combination of chance events and human intervention (McCaw and Hanstrum 2003; O'Donnell et al. 2011; Sullivan et al. 2012).

The climate of south-west Western Australia is becoming drier and warmer, and reduced winter rainfall is making the landscape drier (Indian Ocean Climate Initiative 2012). During the past decade these trends have reinforced, and in some years the fire season has extended into traditional winter months. Examination of DPaW fire report data indicates that during the past decade the incidence of bushfires ignited by lightning has also increased markedly in some parts of the south-west (McCaw and Read 2012). Land use, socio-economic and organizational factors have led to more widespread occurrence of old fuels (>20 years), increasing the potential for high severity fires that may have adverse impacts on ecosystem services and the community (McCaw 2013).

Much of the science linking interactions between climate, fire weather and fire behaviour was established in the 1960s and 1970s, but new advances in understanding and in computer modeling capability provide the scope to better understand the interactions of weather and fire behaviour (Mills and McCaw 2010; Matthews et al. 2012; Peace et al. 2012). Coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to capture feedback loops between a fire and the atmosphere, enabling better understanding of how a fire may modify the environment in which it is burning. This is of particular importance during large-scale, high intensity bushfires. Application of physically based models provides enhanced scope for predicting how changes in regional scale changes in atmospheric circulation processes may influence more localized fire weather phenomena including convective activity, lightning and entrainment of dry air from mid levels of the atmosphere.
","<p>This project will synthesize and integrate a range of information relating to climate, fire occurrence and the impact of changing fire regimes on ecosystem services. Drawing on fire data held by DPaW, and on work undertaken by organizations with expertise in climate analysis and modeling the project aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide an objective basis to review and revise management guidelines based on past research and experience during wetter climate phases,</li>
<li>provide a contextual setting for targeted investigations of ecosystem responses to fire and climate.</li>
</ul>","<p>This project addresses the two actions from the Science and Conservation Division Strategic Plan for Biodiversity Conservation Research:<br />
Action 2.15 - Continue with long-term fire research in south-west ecosystems as a basis for developing ecologically appropriate fire management in a global biodiversity hotspot.<br />
Action 2.16 - Develop an understanding of the influence of climate change on fire regimes and ecosystem response in south-west ecosystems as a basis for developing response options.</p>
<p>The project will result in improved understanding, leading to more effective management response to key drivers of fire regimes in south-west Western Australia including</p>
<ul>
<li>a drying climate characterized by short winters and declining soil moisture, streamflow and groundwater levels</li>
<li>increased incidence of bushfires ignited by lightning</li>
<li>more widespread occurrence of old fuels (&gt;20 years) prone to high severity fires</li>
<li>more widespread occurrence of ecosystems modified by mining</li>
</ul>","<p>The primary users of knowledge generated by this project will be DPaW Regional Services and Fire Management Division, including policy makers, fire planners, and fire operations personnel. Personnel in other Western Australian fire management agencies also stand to benefit from knowledge generated by this project. The project is also expected to provide important contextual information for policy settings relating to nature conservation and ecosystem services in fire prone landscapes of south-west WA.</p>
<p><code>Knowledge generated by the project will be communicated in a variety of ways including conventional scientific publications and reports, information sheets and standard operating procedures. Opportunities to utilize advanced computer simulation models and high resolution graphical interfaces will also be investigated where appropriate. Key finding will be incorporated into training programs delivered to DPaW fire management personnel.</code></p>","<ul>

<p>Data from bushfire incidents in south west Western Australia will be used to develop models that  predict the day to day variation in the number of human-caused bushfires within six DPaW  management areas.  Fire incident data will be compiled with weather variables, binary classifications   of day types (e.g. school days) and counts of the number of fires that occurred over recent days.  Models will be developed using negative binomial regression with a dataset covering three years and evaluated using data from an independent year.

<p>Trends in the occurrence of lightning caused bushfires in south-west WA (collaboration with Bureau of Meteorology)</p>
<p>Fire reports from 1977 to 2012 have been collated for the Warren Region and the adjoining Kirup section of Blackwood District, an area that encompasses &gt;1 million hectares of public land comprised  of tall open forest, open forest, woodland and coastal shrubland. Reports provide details of the     location (to a precision of ± 160 m), date and time of lightning-caused bushfires attended by the DPaW and its predecessor agencies. Data more than 300 lightning-caused bushfires will be used to examine  the annual pattern and duration of lightning fire activity, and year to year variation in the frequency of  lightning ignition. Spatial pattern of fire occurrence will be examined in relation to vegetation structural  types and time since last fire using GIS intersection. The Bureau of Meteorology are developing a set  of indicators of lightning-fire occurrence for different regions throughout Australia, and will use DPaW  fire occurrence observations to verify these indicators for south-west WA. These indicators will include a number of physically-based properties derived from meso-scale resolution numerical weather     models. These models can be run retrospectively to generate indices back to the 1970s, and can also  be run in a predictive capacity to investigate the potential influences of changes in regional and global  patterns of circulation that may arise from rising global temperatures and atmospheric greenhouse gas  concentrations.</p>
<p>Simulating the behaviour of bushfires using a coupled fire atmosphere model (collaboration with University of Adelaide and Bureau of Meteorology)</p>
<p>This project will explore the capabilities and applications of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by examining case studies of bushfires, including the 2010 Layman prescribed burn in  Blackwood District. A detailed case study has been prepared documenting the circumstances and behaviour of this burn, and the associated weather factors including atmospheric stability, sea-breeze  convergence and entrainment of dry air from aloft. The WRF model is being run with and without  feedback between the fire and the atmosphere to resolve differences in fire activity and atmospheric properties including wind speed and direction, and convective activity. The WRFmodel is being programmed and run by PhD student Mika Peace using the 'Tizard' supercomputer at the South  Australian Information Technology Centre.

2865,,"<p>The Abrolhos islands are a popular recreation site, currently free of introduced predators, and host the only WA population of the Abrolhos painted button quail (Turnix varius scintillans), several important seabird breeding areas, and sea lion breeding areas that may be negatively impacted by disturbance, among other biodiversity values. Abrolhos painted button quails (APBQ) were recently identified as at high risk of extinction. The APBQ is resident on East and West Wallabi Islands (a single connected population), now likely to be the only remaining population of APBQs, as a result of the extirpation of a population on North Island where they were once common. Houtman-Abrolhos Islands National Park (HAINP) was declared on 25th July 2019. HAINP was declared for its biodiversity, heritage and landscape values and to create opportunities for visitors to enjoy their unrivalled beauty. Managing HAINP requires a base of operations which is planned on East Wallabi Island. Significant investment to implement tourism infrastructure including a new jetty on East Wallabi Island has been assigned. Some natural values have already experienced declines on East Wallabi, and increased use may result in increased invasion risk by feral species such as rats. But how likely invasion will be is unclear, and there are also potential benefits, including increased opportunities to detect any invasion should it occur. In response to the HAINP declaration, given the likely increase in visitation and use identified in the draft management plan, and concern about the implications of the arrival of invasive mammals, a risk assessment was considered desirable. A pilot workshop was conducted at which a risk assessment was identified as a key need for APBQ.&nbsp;</p>","<p>This project aims to evaluate risks to the Abrolhos painted button quail and identify cost-effective management strategies to ensure their long term persistence, using Structured Decision Making in collaboration with the DBCA Midwest Region.</p>","<p>The work will directly inform regional decision making by providing a better understanding of the potential risks to Abrolhos painted button quails, and identify cost-effective management strategies to ensure their long term persistence.

1947,"<p>The project is related to SPP 2012-002 Climate resilient revegetation of multi-use landscapes: exploiting genetic variability in widespread species as it is using the same approach. Margaret Byrne is the leader of both projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns due to climate change can cause large-scale forest dieback and mortality, with major consequences for the maintenance of biodiversity and healthy forest and woodland ecosystems (Allen <em>et al. </em>2005). The Southwest Australia biodiversity hotspot has extensive forest environments that have been subject to drought deaths in recent years. The average rainfall in this region has already declined by 15-20% in the last 30 years resulting in significant crown death of forest (Matusick <em>et al. </em>2013; Brouwers et al 2013), affecting fauna habitat and essential ecosystem services. Rainfall is predicted to decline further (Bates <em>et al.</em> 2008) with more frequent and intense droughts (IPPC 2014).</p>
<p>The majority of predictions of how organisms will respond to climate change are based on correlative environmental (niche) models with unrealistic assumptions (e.g. no adaptation, species homogeneity, infinite migration, realised = fundamental niche; Hoffmann &amp; Sgro 2011). While recent efforts have been made to develop more realistic mechanistic models (incorporating dispersal ability - Swab <em>et al.</em> 2012; physiological responses - Kearney &amp; Porter 2009; evolution responses to climate - Hoffmann &amp; Sgro 2011), these are restricted to well-characterized model systems, and even in these cases empirical data is limited. To fill this knowledge gap, our project will explore the mechanisms facilitating genetic adaptation and physiological tolerance, that can be utilised to facilitate population persistence in a rapidly changing climate.</p>
<p>The research will focus on <em>Corymbia calophylla</em> (<em>Eucalyptus</em> sensu lato, family Myrtaceae), an economically and ecologically important forest tree native to the jarrah, tuart, wandoo, and karri forests and woodlands of south-west Australia. This bloodwood, commonly known as marri, is a large tree growing to 40 metres tall in the wild, with very large buds and fruit (Boland et al. 2006). Marri is widely distributed from north of Geraldton (28&deg; S) to Cape Riche (34&deg; S), and inland beyond Narrogin (33&deg;S 117&deg; E). It is found on the Swan Coastal Plain and on the Darling Scarp, showing its adaptability to the different environments (traversing major temperature and rainfall gradients). Temperature increases with latitude (c. 24-30&deg;C maximum), while annual rainfall decreases with distance from the coast (c. 400-1200mm) providing a unique opportunity to separate these climatic drivers.</p>
<p>Marri is an important component of the forest ecosystem providing nesting hollows and a food source for endangered cockatoo species. In addition to being an important timber tree, the fruit, seeds, flowers, leaves and wood of marri are all important sources of food for native fauna. The seeds are a major food source for nationally listed threatened birds (Baudin&rsquo;s black cockatoo and Carnaby&rsquo;s black cockatoo) and the maintenance of habitat and food resources is a key factor in forest management practice. In each of the forest and woodland ecosystems where marri is present, it is an important and integral keystone species. Consequently, a decline in its overall health, as we are now experiencing due to drought and disease, will have significant long-term detrimental impacts on ecosystem function.&nbsp; This study has national and international significance for understanding and managing forests for future climates.</p>
<p>Current forest regeneration practice is governed by the Forest Management Plan 2014-2023 that provides for seed sourcing from land management units adjacent to the site based on a broad interpretation of local provenance in widespread semi-continuous species (Byrne et al 2013, Breed et al 2012). Assisted gene migration has also been advocated as a tool for land managers and foresters in managing forests and establishing plantations for future climates (Gallagher et al 2014, Aitken &amp; Whitlock 2013). Unfortunately, there is little information to base guidance for land-managers to implement assisted gene migration. This projectl will fill this gap and provide a scientific basis for the adoption of assisted gene migration in south-west forests, through a detailed understanding of genetic adaptation and physiological tolerance, to enhance drought-resilience under future hotter and drier climates in marri.</p>","<p>Understanding genetic adaptation and physiological tolerance are critically important for developing management tools for sustainable and productive forest ecosystems in a drying climate; however, these factors remain relatively unknown. This project will investigate these factors in marri and aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>characterise neutral and adaptive genetic variation to estimate demographic (population size, migration) and evolutionary (adaptation to climate) processes;</li>
<li>estimate the heritability of plant functional traits associated with growth and resilience, and correlated traits, to determine the propensity for genetic adaptation;</li>
<li>determine the physiological and molecular capacity to respond to drought to elucidate the mechanisms enabling plants to persist under climate change.</li>
</ul>","<p>Assisted gene migration has been suggested as a key climate change adaptation strategy for forests worldwide, and could be readily incorporated into current silvicultural practices in south-west forests through the inclusion of seed from dry adapted provenances in regeneration. This project will provide the scientific evidence required to determine effective assisted gene migration practices in southwest forests for resilience to changing climates, providing a basis for adoption of this practice by decision-makers and acceptance by the community and non-government organisations.</p>
<p>Specific outcomes for the three aims of the project are:</p>

Nature 510: 356-362</p>","<p>Our conceptual framework utilizes the natural climatic variation and diversity of plant genotypes in south-west Australia (Fig 1) to explore the capacity of plants to respond to climate change through genetic adaptation and physiological tolerance. Our conceptual framework was developed from the findings produced in a pilot ecophysiological research project with CIs Rymer, Tissue and Byrne. In this experiment, seed provenances from the temperature and rainfall extremes of the species were grown under warm (18-32&deg;C) and cool (12-26&deg;C) temperature regimes, and subsequently water was limited to determine the threshold of hydraulic failure. Physiological tolerance (P<sub>50leaf</sub>) was significantly higher in slower growing warmer climate provenances, than cooler provenances with faster growth rates. Rainfall was not a major determinant of plant growth or physiological tolerance despite the enormous variation among provenances (500-1250mm; Fig. 1). While growing temperature had a significant effect on photosynthetic capacity and plant growth, we found a non-significant response of hydraulics to temperature.</p>
<p>Is this pattern of genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity driven by demographic or evolutionary processes? What is the underlying adaptive genetic variation associated with the traits? Is there a heritable component? Is there a continuous cline in the traits along temperature and rainfall gradients? The proposed research will address these questions based on three objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) Characterise neutral and adaptive genetic variation to estimate demographic (population size, migration) and evolutionary (adaptation to climate) processes</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hypothesis 1</em>: Populations in regions experiencing consistent cool and wet conditions have maintained larger populations harbouring greater neutral genetic variation.</li>
<li><em>Hypothesis 2</em>: Populations in warm, dry areas are a source of adaptive genetic variation for drought resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Background:</u> </em>It is well recognised that genetic variation is not distributed evenly across the landscape. Geographic and environmental barriers to genetic exchange may subdivide populations. While this may facilitate subpopulations adapting to the local environment (Barton), it could limit the migration of genes from warmer / drier populations to other regions preventing pre-adaption to future climates (Drake et al 2014). At the same time, climatically stable regions may act as a source of genotypes for ephemeral, climatically variable regions (Rymer et al. 2012).&nbsp; Much of our understanding of the importance of genetic variation for adaptive capacity has come from model systems (fruit flies; Hoffmann), crop plants (e.g. maize; Tenaillon <em>et al.</em> 2001), and related species (<em>Arabidopsis</em>; Hu <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, for many Australian plants a basic ecological, physiological and molecular characterisation is lacking. The recently published <em>Eucalyptus</em> genome (Myburg et al 2014), in combination with advances in next-generation-sequencing technology for population genomics (RAD &ndash; Baird et al 2008, ddRAD &ndash; Peterson et al 2012), genetic models to elucidate demographic patterns (Hubisz <em>et al.</em> 2009; Hey 2010) and genetic signatures of selection across the genome (Nielsen 2005), has opened the door to ecological and evolutionary investigations. We will establish the patterns of neutral and adaptive variation present within marri to determine the most effective combination of germplasm for use in forest management strategies aimed at ensuring resilience to changing climates.</p>
<p><em><u>Methods:</u></em> Population samples from across the entire geographic and climatic distribution of the species (Fig. 1) have been collected and stored for genetic analyses by PI Byrne DPaW. In addition, seeds are available from FPC for all 170 families represented in the quantitative genetic trials (total 794 samples), providing a large representative sample of the species. We will employ a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach to genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) randomly distributed across the genome for large population samples enabling robust estimates of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. GBS reduces the representation of the genome to sequence tags at target cut-sites, which can be highly multiplexed in next-generation-sequencing platforms. Each DNA will be uniquely barcoded to maintain its identity. Sequencing libraries will be produced in-house following the ddRAD methodology (Peterson et al 2012). Quality control will be ensured with the application of robotics (Perkin Elmer Janus Automated Workstation) in the LIEF Robotics Facility (housed at ANU) with blanks and technical replicates on all plates. Libraries will be examined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer prior to sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. To obtain high coverage (&gt;20X) of each DNA for approximately 40,000 SNPs we will run the 794 samples on 5 HiSeq lanes. Bioinformatic analyses will be conducted on HIE virtual machine (24 core 128GB RAM), and &lsquo;Orange&rsquo; HPC (Intersect with 3 addition HIE nodes 20 core 256GB RAM each). STACKS and PyRAd will be used to estimate SNPs, with STRUCTURE and PCoA used to identify genetic relationships. An Outlier analysis using Bayescan v. 2.1 (Foll &amp; Gaggiotti 2008) will be employed to identify the component of genetic differentiation based on diversifying selection.&nbsp; Bayescan is considered to be one of the most robust methods for outlier detection (Narum &amp; Hess 2011; Perez-Figueroa et al. 2010; Savolainen et al. 2013; Vilas et al. 2012), even though the assumption of an island model of allele frequency correlation is not always valid. Neutral loci and loci under divergent selection will be examined separately for associations with geography and climate.</p>
<p>2) Estimate the heritability of plant functional traits associated with growth and resilience</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hypothesis 3</em>: Traits associated with plant structure and resilience will be highly heritable and therefore responsive to selection enabling <u>genetic adaptation</u>.</li>
<li><em>Hypothesis 4</em>: Growth and photosynthetic traits will have high levels of phenotypic plasticity and therefore responsive to climate change enabling <u>physiological tolerance</u>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Background</u>: </em>Heritability and genetic variation are the essential ingredients for adaptation to rapidly changing climate. The phenotypic traits expressed by a plant are determined by its genetic make-up as well as the environment. Quantitative genetics partitions the phenotypic variation to estimate the component that is genetically controlled (i.e. heritable). Wood traits have been well characterised for forestry species, showing high levels of heritability and application to breeding programs (REF). Traits associated with leaf and stem resistance to cavitation (embolism) have also been shown to be heritable, with trait variation among related species and populations in different rainfall zones (REF). These structural traits tend not to vary between environments, indicating that genetic adaptation is much more important than phenotypic plasticity. Growth and photosynthetic traits, on the other hand, often show low heritability with trait shifts driven by changes in the climate (temperature &amp; water; Duan et al 2014). Acclimatisation of photosynthesis capacity with warming and elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> maintains net photosynthesis, thereby allowing plants to allocate resources to other functions and regulate growth.</p>
<p><em><u>Methods</u>: </em>Large quantitative genetic trials have recently been established for marri by CI Hardy as part of an existing ARC Linkage (LP120200581) research project with DPaW. Seed was supplied by FPC and additional populations were collected to capture the species distribution. The trials have 18 provenances with approximately 170 families; each had 24 seedlings planted in a randomised blocking design at three sites with contrasting rainfall patterns (Fig. 1). Plantation sites were unused pastures within the natural distribution of the jarrah forest where marri is a dominant canopy tree. This project will measure the rate of growth and a range of plant functional traits at all three sites along the rainfall gradient, targeting provenances that revealed significant genetic and physiological patterns (objectives 1 &amp; 3). Plant height, canopy cover and diameter will be measured each year of the project, and allometric relationships used to estimate plant leaf area, stem volume and above-ground biomass. A subset of trees will be assessed in more detail to explore correlative relationships among functional traits, including leaf and wood properties. Leaf gas exchange campaigns will estimate stomatal conductance, leaf transpiration and net photosynthesis. Leaf and stem hydraulics will estimate the susceptibility to cavitation and therefore sensitivity to drought. The data will be explored using mixed effects models focusing on the response of provenances at the planting sites (highlighting adaptive GxE interactions). Multivariate statistics and cluster analyses will be used to reveal patterns and associations. Heritability of traits, based on the half-sib design, will be estimated by partitioning of the phenotypic variation within and among families at each site and for the combined dataset.</p>
<p>3) Determine the physiological and molecular capacity to respond to climate change</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hypothesis 5</em>: Plants growing under temperature and water regimes found in their native source population will outperform plants from different climates (&lsquo;local-is-best&rsquo;).</li>
<li><em>Hypothesis 6</em>: Populations from warm and dry climatic origins will have higher resilience to drought stress.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><u>Background:</u></em> There is an enormous diversity in how plants respond to their environment. Much of the literature has focused on understanding this diversity of responses with comparisons between plant functional groups (e.g. C3/C4 grasses, Pinto et al 2014), and unrelated species in assemblages (e.g. deserts, Robertson et al. 2009; Patrick et al 2009More recently there has been growing interest in understanding how these traits have evolved with studies investigating congeneric species and populations of a single species in contrasting climates (e.g. Steane et al. 2014). Plants respond to their environment utilising available resources for growth and reproduction, and maintaining stasis and function during times of stress. A trade-off has been hypothesized where fast growing plants, which invest less in structural components, are more susceptible to stress conditions than slow growing plants (Lewis et al. 2011). Empirical tests have been mixed in support for this hypothesis, which is partly due to variation in the frequency and intensity of stress applied, and partly due to a lack of integration across traits (Drake et al 2014). An interconnected approach will avoid idiosyncratic results, and will be achieved by sampling from different environments (local and foreign conditions) and stages of stress (base-line well watered through range of water potentials to stress and recovery cycles), with traits sampled across multiple scales from whole plant, leaf level, and cellular to molecular.</p>
<p><em><u>Methods</u>: </em>Seed from populations from across the species range are available through PI Devoe (FPC). The 18 provenances represented in the trials will be grown under controlled glasshouse conditions to undertake temperature and water manipulations. Plants will be grown under three temperature regimes (cool 12-26&deg;C, intermediate 15-29&deg;C, warm 18-32&deg;C) maintained to ensure water and nutrients are not limiting. This experiment will enable a test of the &lsquo;local-is-best&rsquo; hypothesis, and identify genotypic (G) and environmental (E) differences, as well as, G x E interactions indicative of local adaptation. A drought cycle will be applied (Duan et al. ) to determine both the sensitivity and resilience to droughtThe plant responses will be characterised by intensive physiological sampling throughout. Critically this will include sampling at baseline (100% water holding capacity), at regular intervals with water limitation to a defined physiological stress (P50), and following rewatering at regular intervals for a defined period of time. Pots will be weighed and hand watered to maintain similar water availability within treatments. Plant growth will be measured fortnightly as basal diameter and plant height, and at the end of 5-6 months, a final harvest will be conducted to determine leaf, stem and root biomass. Plant leaf traits (size, shape, specific leaf area, stomatal density, and cellular structure) and leaf physiology (photosynthesis, conductance, water potential) will be obtained. In addition, we will explore the response of photosynthetic capacity to temperatures (ACi at 20, 25, 30, 35, 40&ordm;C) (Ghannoum et al. 2010), and the leaf susceptibility to water limitation (K<sub>leaf</sub> at 0 to -60 bars) (Duan et al. 2014).</p>
<p>The molecular response of seedlings from the climatic regions to shifts in growing temperature and drought cycles will be investigated using transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq). Leaf material from all plants and all conditions will be snap frozen with liquid N2&nbsp;then stored at -80C. The molecular processes controlling significant growth and physiological response will be characterized with Illumina RNA-seq. Experimental design will involve 3 growing temperatures (26&ordm;C, 29&ordm;C, 32&ordm;C) X 3 drought periods (baseline, peak, recovery) X 4 climatic regions (warm &amp; dry, warm &amp; wet, cool &amp; dry, cool &amp; wet) X 2 replicate populations (total 72 libraries run on 8 lanes). A reference transcriptome and complete genome sequence for <em>Eucalyptus </em>(Myburg et al. 2014) is available for sequence reads to be mapped, and the estimation of gene expression levels and sequence variation. Bioinformatic analyses will be conducted on UWS virtual machines (24core 128G RAM) and the NSW Intersect &lsquo;Orange&rsquo; High-Performance-Compute. This will provide crucial information on the levels of acclimatisation and genetic adaptation to climate change. In brief, the statistical approach will assemble the reads into contigs, which will be mapped allowing large gaps on the annotated Eucalyptus genome to generate a reference transcriptome to map the libraries for gene expression. We will employ CLC Genomics Workbench &amp; CLC Server and Trinity software packages.</p>

656,"SPP 1996/014 
","Control of feral cats is recognised as one of the most important conservation issues in Australia today. The impact of feral cats on native fauna is acknowledged by Commonwealth legislation, as outlined in Schedule 3 of the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. The national ‘Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats’ (Anon. 1999) lists 38 species on Schedule 1 of the above Act for which there is a known or inferred threat from feral cat populations. That is, 38 endangered species have been identified as potentially benefiting from effective feral cat control, as part of their management/recovery programs.

Predation by feral cats (Felis catus) has been identified as one of the major obstacles to the reconstruction of the fauna, particularly small to medium-sized mammals, in the arid and semi-arid zones of Australia (Dickman 1996; Anon. 1999). Anecdotal evidence has indicated that predation by feral cats, either acting singly or in concert with other factors, has resulted in the local extinction of a number of species on islands and mainland Australia.  Many of these species are now restricted to several offshore islands, others have undergone dramatic contractions in their former mainland range.  Due to small population sizes and restricted geographic ranges these species are vulnerable to total extinction. 

Predation by feral cats also affects the continued survival of many native species persisting at low population levels (Dickman 1996; Smith and Quin 1996) and has prevented the successful re-introduction of species to parts of their former range (Gibson et al. 1994; Christensen and Burrows 1994). 

Broad-scale baiting offers the best option to control feral cats in strategic areas and is seen as the method most likely to produce an effective operational method for cat control (Anon. 1999). Development of an effective baiting technique for the control of the feral cat is cited as a high priority by the national Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats (Anon. 1999). The Department of Conservation and Land Management has designed and developed a bait medium that is attractive to feral cats and effective in controlling them on a localised scale. The baits are manufactured at the Department’s Bait Factory at Harvey. This bait medium has been employed as an integral part of successful island cat eradication programs off the Western Australian coast (Algar and Burbidge 2000; Algar et al. in press) and was used as the sole tool of eradication on Faure Island (Algar et al. in prep.). The program, in progress, described in this SPP is aimed at developing optimal broad-scale control programs for feral cats. 
","<p>There are a number of key factors that need to be researched if an effective broad-scale aerial baiting strategy for feral cats is to be developed. These research areas need to be examined in chronological order if the control strategy is to be optimised. The research areas are listed below: -</p>
<ol>
<li>to examine bait uptake in relation to the time of year to enable baiting programs to be conducted when bait uptake is at its peak and therefore maximise efficiency;</li>
<li>to examine baiting intensity (number of baits laid/km2) in relation to baiting efficiency to optimise control;</li>
<li>to examine baiting frequency (number of times/year or yearly intervals) required to provide sustained effective control.</li>
<li>In addition to optimising the various parameters of baiting programs, it will be necessary to research two further factors: -</li>
<li>to assess the potential impact of baiting programs on non-target species populations and devise methods to reduce the potential risk where possible; </li>
<li>to provide scientific validation of the Track Density Index (TDI) as a reliable estimate of relative cat abundance. The technique initially is required to provide an objective assessment of baiting frequency.</li>
</ol>
<p>These research areas are discussed in detail in the following sections.</p>",<p>The step-wise approach to developing an optimal broad-scale cat predation control strategy for wildlife recovery outlined above is being pursued to provide for effective and cost-efficient wildlife recovery.  The focus is on optimising cat predation control through aerial baiting and providing a comprehensive evaluation of any impact on non-target species populations.  The program is structured to enable analysis of the cost-benefit of various baiting regimes on both feral cats and non-target species and provide information essential to gaining registration of the cat bait.  Once registration is achieved the baiting protocols developed will be able to be implemented across the arid and semi-arid interior of Australia and perhaps elsewhere in the world.</p>,"<p>This research program extends predator control and wildlife re-introductions to the semi-arid and arid zones. Once registration of the cat bait has been achieved, operational campaigns can be conducted by the Department to control feral cats in strategic areas under the umbrella program ‘Western Shield’. Results of this program will also be of considerable value to other States and Territories involved in feral cat control and re-introduction projects.</p>","<p><strong>Date</strong></p>

The quality of the night sky at the Bickley site of Perth Observatory for research work is diminishing due to the expansion of the city of Perth and the attendant increase in light pollution. Furthermore, there are tentative plans for a future Large Australian optical Telescope of aperture greater than the 4m currently existing in Australia. It is therefore prudent to evaluate sites around Western Australia in anticipation of funds forthcoming for a new research optical telescope facility. Furthermore, the internet alleviates the difficulties of the past associated with remote operation of such facilities.

At the request of the Executive Director, the Science Division has prepared a scoping document for a comprehensive biological survey of the Pilbara IBRA bioregion. Stygofauna has not previously been included in the broadscale biological survey program in Western Australia (eg Burbidge et al. 2000) but lack of information about stygofauna and its distribution in the Pilbara is hampering economically important resource development projects and making it difficult to assess their likely environmental impacts because of the large number of new species being discovered in impact statement surveys.  Most large projects need to de-water, which has the potential to affect the habitat of stygofauna.  Furthermore, as the population in the Pilbara increases there will be increasing use of groundwater for domestic water supply.  The urgent need for a regional survey to provide a framework for decisions about the conservation and management of stygofauna was identified in Recommendation 1 of Dr Phillip Playford's recent review of stygofauna for the Environmental Protection Authority, as well as at recent workshops involving government and industry.  Important issues for stygofaunal management are determining whether stygofaunal populations can persist in areas subject to groundwater drawdown, finding ways to facilitate their survival, and understanding the ecosystem service functions they provide.  For example, if stygofauna have an important role in the maintenance of groundwater quality, this will have implications for their protection in areas where extraction for domestic water supply is likely.  The proposed survey will attempt to provide regional level information relevant to these issues to complement studies by mining companies and others that directly address the management of drawdown.

<p>At the request of the Executive Director, the Science Division has prepared a scoping document for a comprehensive biological survey of the Pilbara IBRA bioregion.  The biota of the region is still poorly documented, despite a considerable amount of localised survey by government institutions and mining companies.  This hampers assessment of the likely environmental impacts of many economically important development projects, as well as development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system.  New species of terrestrial plants and vertebrates, as well as very large numbers of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, are still being discovered in the Pilbara.  In addition, the region has recently been shown to contain a very rich groundwater fauna, which has considerable conservation importance and a high degree of local endemism.  An indication of how much survey work will be required to define the distribution of groundwater species is provided by Hatton and Evans (1998, p 2), who concluded in their review of the groundwater systems in Australia for LWRRDC that ""virtually nothing is known … in terms of biodiversity"", although worldwide there is a recognition that groundwater probably contains a greater array of freshwater species than surface waters (Gibert et al. 1994).</p>
<p>Stygofauna have not previously been included in the broadscale biological survey program in Western Australia (eg Burbidge et al. 2000) but lack of information about stygofauna and its distribution in the Pilbara is hampering economically important resource development projects and making it difficult to assess their likely environmental impacts because of the large number of new species being discovered in impact statement surveys.  Most large projects need to de-water, which has the potential to affect the habitat of stygofauna.  Furthermore, as the population in the Pilbara increases there will be increasing use of groundwater for domestic water supply.  The urgent need for a regional survey to provide a framework for decisions about the conservation and management of stygofauna was identified in Recommendation 1 of Dr Phillip Playford's recent review of stygofauna for the Environmental Protection Authority, as well as at recent workshops involving government and industry.  Important issues for stygofaunal management are determining whether stygofaunal populations can persist in areas subject to groundwater drawdown, finding ways to facilitate their survival, and understanding the ecosystem service functions they provide.  For example, if stygofauna have an important role in the maintenance of groundwater quality, this will have implications for their protection in areas where extraction for domestic water supply is likely.  The proposed survey will attempt to provide regional level information relevant to these issues to complement studies by mining companies and others that directly address the management of drawdown.</p>
<p>A regional biological survey will provide an overview of biodiversity in the region and a context for assessing the significance of localised occurrences of surface and groundwater species (see Burbidge et al. 2000).</p>
<p>Specific aims are:</p>
<p>1.         provide a regional perspective on biodiversity and nature conservation priorities</p>
<p>2.         provide a regional context for the conservation implications of development proposals</p>
<p>3.         assess the adequacy of the existing reserve system and identify particular species or communities that warrant protection</p>
<p>4.         identify gradients in community composition, and the environmental factors related to these gradients, to provide a better understanding of plant and animal distributions and better data on which to base management actions</p>
<p>5.         provide systematic baseline data on the distribution of the biota of the region and a framework for future monitoring of regional scale trends</p>
<p>6.         undertake taxonomic studies to define and describe key species that define groundwater communities and provide keys for easy identification of the fauna</p>
<p>7.         complement site-specific studies being undertaken by mining companies on the distribution and ecology of stygofauna</p>
<p>8.         provide a forum for coordination of stygofaunal research in Western Australia, pooling of information, and standardisation of techniques</p>
<p>In order to relate the occurrence of biota to environmental parameters (e.g. climate, water and soil chemistry etc), and to provide a basis for subsequent monitoring, the survey will be point-based.</p>
<p>Other agencies involved in the proposal</p>
<p>Although the project will be coordinated and run by the Science Division, the Western Australian Museum will also have an important role and will contribute several staff.</p>
<p>Area to be surveyed</p>
<p>The area to be surveyed is the Pilbara IBRA bioregion (see Fig. 1) and the remainder of the Ashburton catchment. Points to be sampled will be chosen after existing biological data, and relevant climatic, soil and stratigraphic data, from the region have been compiled and reviewed.  Metadata for most of the biological datasets have been compiled by government and will soon be housed in the Science Division (Pilbara Environmental Surveys database).  In combination, maps available from the above studies and recent work by the Department of Agriculture on vegetation and land units in the region provide a rational basis for stratifying the biodiversity sampling program.  The Water and Rivers Commission's database of bores in the Pilbara will be used to locate potentially suitable bores for stygofaunal sampling and results of the recently completed First National Assessment of River Health, using AusRivAS, will be used in the selection of aquatic sites</p>
<p>Approach and scope</p>
<p>The approach being taken is that the survey should be point-based, as comprehensive as possible in terms of the number of taxonomic groups and habitats surveyed, and provide regional-level information about species-level biodiversity patterns in the Pilbara.  The survey will focus on four broad components - terrestrial fauna, terrestrial flora, aquatic flora and fauna, and stygofauna.</p>
<p>Sampling methodology for the surveys will be explicit and repeatable.  Taxonomic groups to be covered are listed in Table 1.  They include the biological groups of most public conservation interest.  Other factors influencing selection of taxa were that the survey should focus on a mix of trophic levels, show biogeographic pattern at a variety of scales, and include taxa with well known habitat associations elsewhere to provide an extrinsic context for interpreting survey results.</p>
<p>A range of physical and chemical measurements will be taken at each site to document environmental tolerances of the biota and to enable species and community distributions to be related to environmental gradients.  This will allow some predictive modelling of species and community distributions and interpolation across sites that were not sampled.</p>
<p>Sampling strategies</p>
<p>The Pilbara is a large region, with a total area of almost 200,000km2.  A large number of sampling sites will be needed to encapsulate the full variation of geological and climatic conditions and to maintain similar site densities to that of previous CALM surveys.  The suggested number of sites in each survey component is listed in Table 2.</p>
<p>Survey techniques will conform to accepted practice.  At terrestrial survey points, birds will be censused in large quadrats, within which terrestrial mammals (other than bats), reptiles, frogs and spiders/arachnids will be pit-trapped, bats echo-located and plants scored in smaller quadrats.  At aquatic survey points, waterbirds will be censused and invertebrates will be collected in sweep nets using a range of mesh sizes.  Stygofauna will be collected mostly from boreholes but sampling will also occur at surface springs where groundwater discharges.  In most cases, existing boreholes will be used although it is expected that a small number of purpose-drilled holes will be required as well.</p>

<p>Staff and associated institutions</p>
<p>The survey will be coordinated, and largely undertaken, by the Department of Conservation and Land Management but staff from the Western Australian Museum will also have a major role.  A small number of specialists from other institutions will be involved.  Table 3 is a list of staff and institutions with potential direct involvement.  We will be seeking assistance and indirect involvement from a wider range of institutions and companies, especially those based in the Pilbara, and will endeavour to maintain a high level of liaison.</p>

632,,"All Australian mistletoes are indigenous plants.  Many species are poorly known and represented by fewer than 10 collections in PERTH.  In part, this is because they are frequently overlooked on botanical surveys.  Some apparently rare species are, in fact, common.  Others seem genuinely rare.  In any event, their distribution is poorly known and I am aware of several undescribed Western Australian species.  

Mistletoes are unusual in that most species have no means of surviving fire (eg. as seed, bulbs, lignotubers etc) despite being very fire sensitive, living in fire prone communities and often on hosts that are killed by fire.  Where their hosts survive (eg. many eucalypts) but mistletoes are killed by fire, regeneration has to be by seed import from outside the burn area.  Birds are the vectors.  Where the hosts are also killed by fire (eg. many Acacia sp.) the process of re-colonisation can not commence until the host population has matured. 

Mistletoes are thus threatened by extensive and/or frequent fires.  Moreover, where mistletoe diversity and/or abundance is high, they may indicate a mild fire regime over many years.  As fire histories are absent for many parts of the State, such indicators are important to fire impact research.  

All mistletoe species are host specific to some extent, some more than others.  Whilst mistletoes are overlooked by many botanical surveyors, recording of the host is even rarer.  Nevertheless, the fire response of hosts is critical to the process of recovery after fire by mistletoes.  Thus, knowledge of host preferences is fundamental to understanding the implications of mistletoe populations as indicators of fire regimes and in preparing fire management programs that take account of these fire-sensitive plants. 

I already have a vouchered  database of >1500 mistletoe/host records from around the Satae and I continue to collect data opportunistically.

A new fox bait, 'Probait', has been developed that will decrease the cost of CALM's operational baiting campaigns significantly. Previous experiments (see SPP 99/18) have shown that when Probaits were fed to captive phascogales (Phascogale tapoatafa), sufficient bait material was ingested to raise concerns about the potential risk of individuals of this species being poisoned during baiting campaigns using Probaits. An experiment is therefore planned to determine the actual uptake of Probaits in the field by phascogales.

 

The uptake of Probaits by foxes was also tested (see SPP 99/18) and found to be less than that of the currently used dried meat baits. This difference in uptake may be the result of a difference in field longevity between the two bait types. An experiment is planned to examine the field longevity of Probaits (in comparison with dried meat baits) and to determine the factors that may have influenced their longevity.  In particular the incidence of ant attack and the susceptibility of both bait types to the effects of rainfall will be examined. If the Probait is 10% less resistant to ant attack and/or weathering this will indicate that the difference in uptake between the two bait types may have been due to differences in their longevity. However, it will not be possible to categorically state that any differences in longevity were responsible for the observed difference in bait uptake.  Ideally the uptake experiment undertaken under SPP 99/18 should be repeated with the appropriately modified bait type.

 

 

To determine whether ant attack on the baits (if any) can be reduced, a sample of baits that have had ant repellent added to them during manufacture will be tested for their longevity.  If ant attack on baits is a significant factor in their longevity, then ant repellent will be added to all baits used in baiting campaigns.  

 

 

A harder Probait that has been dried as completely as possible will also be tested to determine if the longevity of Probaits can be increased by increasing their initial hardness. If a difference in longevity was responsible for the difference in bait uptake, and if the harder Probait is 10% more robust than the standard Probait, then this bait type may be used in future baiting campaigns. 

 

 

If the longevity of Probaits is found to be the same as that of dried meat baits it can then be concluded that Probaits are less palatable to foxes than dried meat baits. If this is the case the use of Probaits in operational baiting campaigns will need to be re-evaluated. An experiment would need to be undertaken to determine if the level of Probait uptake is sufficient to result in faunal responses similar to those obtained by baiting with dried meat baits. This experiment would probably involve reintroducing keystone species into replicated areas of suitable habitat and monitoring survival and reproduction for 12 months. If Probaits are not as effective as dried meat baits in producing a faunal response then their use in operational baiting campaigns would not be recommended.  Fox control should then be undertaken with dried meat baits even though this would be more expensive.

 

 

Finally the amount of 1080 that remains in a sample of each bait type under field conditions will be examined to determine if Probaits (either standard or extra hard) retain their 1080 content so that they are as effective as dried meat baits in their ability to control foxes. 

 

 

This work is of high priority to the Department because it will because it will reveal the limitations to the use of the more economical Probait in fox control campaigns.

<p>Analyse data and finalise report on Probait uptake by phascogales</p>",,"<p>1) Bait uptake by phascogales:</p>
<p>i) Determination of the effectiveness of rhodamine as a biomarker for phascogales.</p>
<p>A sample of phascogales will be caught in nest boxes in the Dwellingup or Batalling area (see below). Ideally the number of individuals in this sample will be sufficiently large to enable a statistically robust analysis of their ingestion of rhodamine to be examined (i.e 32 individuals).  However, it is unlikely that this number of individuals will be caught and so this investigation of rhodamine ingestion may be more qualitative than quantitative.</p>
<p>The phascogales will be transported to the animal holding facilities at Agriculture WA at Forrestfield. They will be tested initially to determine their 'background' level of rhodamine (if any). They will then be fed a single Probait that has been labelled with rhodamine. They will be maintained on their normal diet for 2 weeks for the rhodamine to 'label' their whiskers.  Approximately 8-10 whiskers will be removed from each individual. Rhodamine leaves a pink band in the whiskers of individuals that ingest it and this can be detected with ultraviolet light.  The whiskers will be sent to VIAS in Victoria for confirmation of the presence of rhodamine.</p>
<p>ii) If the biomarker is shown to be effective, the field testing of the baits will commence.  Two sites will be aerially baited with non-toxic 'Probaits' that have been labelled with rhodamine. Each bait will contain 50mg of rhodamine that was added as a solution.  The standard baiting rate of 5 baits km-2 will be used. The areas to be used are yet to be identified or quantified (probably Kingston/ Perup, Batalling and/ or Hedges gold mine near Boddington). The phascogale densities in each of these sites will be assessed in December and the actual sites to be used will then identified.  Individuals that will be used for testing the ingestion of rhodamine will be obtained from the site that is not used in the main experiment.</p>
<p>Phascogales will be trapped in both sites approximately 2 weeks after the delivery of the biomarker labelled baits.  Individuals will be caught in nest boxes that have been strategically positioned throughout the sites. When captured each individual will have approximately 8-10 whiskers removed. Approximately 100-120 nest boxes will be present in each site and a 20% capture rate is anticipated (S. Rhind pers comm.). A sample of 16-25 phascogales is therefore anticipated from each site and this should be sufficient to determine if baits are ingested by at least 10% of the population (Matt Williams pers comm.). The proportion of the population that can be 'removed' by baits without affecting population viability will be determined by population viability analysis.  If this level of ingestion is exceeded then alternative methods of controlling foxes in areas where phascogales are present will need to be devised.  This may include the continued use of dried meat baits in those areas.</p>
<p>2) Bait longevity trials:</p>
<p>Baits will be tested at 3 sites: Burnerbinmah, Jacup (Fitzgerald River), Collie. These sites were chosen because they have dissimilar rainfall.</p>
<p>There will be six small exclosures at each site.  Each exclosure will house 144 baits and will be fully fenced in but will still be exposed to the elements. A larger exclosure will be placed around the six small exclosures to ensure that foxes and other predators are prevented from accessing the baits. Four bait types will be tested: the dried meat bait, the standard Probait, a standard Probait with Coopex (an ant repellent) added to it during manufacture, and a very hard Probait (maximum dryness).  These four bait types will be divided evenly between the six small exclosures (i.e 36 of each bait type in each).</p>
<p>The baits in two of the small exclosures (Exclosures 1 &amp; 2) will be exposed to ambient conditions. </p>
<p>The baits in two other small exclosures (Exclosures 3 &amp; 4) will be exposed to ambient conditions but will have additional water added to them each week by spraying them with water from a watering can (amount of water to be added is yet to be determined).  </p>
<p>The final two small exclosures (Exclosures 5 &amp; 6) will be exposed to ambient conditions but will have any ant access to them minimised.  This will be achieved by spraying 'Coopex' around the perimeter of the exclosures.</p>
<p>The presence of ants at each of the six small exclosures will be monitored using insect traps or sticky tape (Final method to be used still to be devised).  </p>
<p>Throughout the experiment rainfall will be recorded.</p>
<p>Every week for 10 weeks, a sample of 3 baits of each type will be retrieved from each of the exclosures at each of the sites.  These will be examined for insect attack and weathering.  A sub-sample of baits will be tested for their 1080 content. It is anticipated that 3 baits of 2 bait types will be analysed from each of the three sites in each of the sampling periods. The number of baits that will actually be analysed for their 1080 content will depend upon the condition of the baits when they are collected. The 1080 content of each of these baits will be determined by Robert Parker of Department of Natural Resources, Queensland. </p>",required,False,<p>None will be collected.

Over the last ten years, populations of the threatened Mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda) have been discovered at several sites in the North-Eastern Goldfields. They have proved to be elusive, with located populations inexplicably declining or disappearing, much to the frustration of researchers. These population fluctuations have prevented assessment of the success of management actions (e.g. habitat fencing and destruction of feral animals) aimed at improving Mulgara conservation around mine sites. 

 

 

Research to date has been successful at recognising habitat that might be occupied by Mulgaras and documenting the basic ecology of the species. However, pressing management questions concerning the stability of populations and ways to prevent local extinctions remain unanswered.

 

 

Further research is necessary to identify core habitat, where Mulgaras survive poor seasons and to determine the reasons for observed population fluctuations. Such research requires intensive monitoring of several Mulgara populations over several years, and the use of techniques such as radio-telemetry to document habitat use and dispersal. The research plan outlined here focuses on critical issues for the long term conservation of Mulgaras in the North-Eastern Goldfields, but also aims to collect similar data on other dasyurids found (or potentially found) in the region, particularly the Long-tailed Dunnart (Sminthopsis longicaudata), Woolley's Pseudantechinus (Pseudantechinus woolleyae) and the Kultarr (Antechinomys laniger). The advantages of working on these four species simultaneously is clear cost-effectiveness; but it will also permit comparisons to be made between population dynamics of sympatric dasyurids and help explain their comparative rarity and apparent population fluctuations.

<p>August-December, Write up of publications; workshop with WMC and CALM regional staff</p>",,"<p>Trapping: Until a comprehensive survey of the location of dasyurid populations is undertaken, the exact trapping array cannot be finalised. Nonetheless, it will involve large trapping grids of 50-100 traps, with traps spaced at 20 m intervals, with several grids placed in each vegetation/fire age. As far as possible, some of these grids will be situated regularly through contiguous habitat to assess movements of the dasyurids in the breeding season.  </p>
<p>A variety of traps will be trialled, but the study will probably rely on Elliott traps baited with universal bait (peanut butter, oats and bacon fat or sardines) and pitfalls. During winter months, traps would be filled with nest material and possibly enclosed in plastic bags in wet weather to reduce the possibility of trap deaths. Traps would be checked and closed early each morning and reopened in the afternoon to prevent trapping of non-target species during daylight hours.</p>
<p>Processing: Handling to be minimised and carried out in situ. Each animal would be weighed and head, pes and tail measured. Reproductive status would be determined by measuring the width of testes or the contents of the pouch. Body condition would be determined by comparing tail width measures and regressing these against body weight and other body parameters. Larger animals would be individually marked by insertion of microchip in fold of skin between the shoulders; smaller ones by ear notching or small ear tags. Upon first capture, material for genetic typing would be collected from each animal. This would involve the removal of a small segment of the tail tip or a small notch from the ear. Such samples would not be required from recaptured animals. Other incidental captures would be processed in the same way. Reptiles would be marked by toe-clipping, because micro-chipping is unsuitable for most species and is very costly.</p>
<p>Voucher specimens: A voucher specimen or specimens will be collected of all species captured will be taken and lodged at the Western Australian Museum (excluding threatened species).</p>
<p>Radio-telemetry: A small and as yet undetermined number of dasyurids (probably around 50) dasyurids would be fitted with micro-transmitters to gather information on movements during the breeding season and at other times. These transmitters will be attached via neck loops or glued onto the body using established techniques and would at all times be &lt;10 % of the body weight of the animal. Individuals to be fitted with radio-transmitters would have them attached in the lab, where they could be monitored for several hours until release after dark.</p>
<p>Genetics: Relationships between individuals and subpopulations, and the assignment of parentage and individual reproductive success would be determined using microsatellite DNA techniques. Samples would be routinely taken in the field and analysed at Murdoch University.Data Management: Trap data and vegetation data would be entered into Access databases back in the office. Radio-telemetric data would have locations calculated in UTM (using hand-held GPS units) and be entered into Access databases. Trap data would be analysed with a variety of mark-recapture estimates (Known to be Alive index, Jolly-Seber Method) and comparisons of captures between sites in ANOVA modules of SigmaStat and/or SYSTAT. Body condition variables would be log-transformed and analysed using simple regression.</p>

The successful recovery of threatened flora, particularly critically endangered plants, will increasingly involve their translocation to secure sites.  There is currently very little information available on how to implement successful threatened plant translocations and virtually no information on how we can determine whether a translocation has or will be successful.  This project aims to develop and refine translocation methodologies, and to develop protocols for determining translocation success by monitoring and gathering critical reproductive data from 16 recently established critically endangered plant translocations.

 

 

The successful recovery of critically endangered flora will rely increasingly on the translocation of these flora to secure sites where the amelioration of threats has been successful or where current threats such as weeds or Phytophora are not present. Translocations are both costly and time consuming, and in many cases involve very small numbers of plants from critically endangered populations.  It is most important that we are able to develop cost effective and efficient methodologies that ensure translocation establishment and that we are also able to develop protocols for determining translocation success

 

 

By the end of 2001 CALM will have carried out 16 translocations of critically endangered as part of approved Interim Recovery Plans.  Various translocation methodologies have been experimentally tested and preliminary data indicates different success rates depending upon site and climatic conditions.  The development of scientifically based translocations methodologies that will offer a reasonable probability of success will require detailed monitoring and data analysis of all the experimental translocations.  Equally critical as part of the same monitoring program will be the need to develop protocols for determining and predicting translocation success.  These protocols will need to be based on estimates of the viability of the translocated population based on reproductive output (seed production, seed viability etc) and ultimately recruitment of new individuals.  Again this information can only be gathered by the detailed monitoring of each translocation .

 

 

The proposed project will involve the monitoring and collection of translocation technique information and demographic data from 16 experimental translocations of critically endangered flora.  Analysis if these data as part of the proposed project will provide the first comprehensive overview of translocation methodologies for threatened flora in WA and the first set of guidelines that could be used for assessing translocation success.

Managing Australia's fragmented landscapes to ensure long-term persistence of native vegetation is a key national conservation objective that also underpins sustainable agricultural production in many regions.  Effective management of fragmented landscapes for integrated conservation/production involves four mains steps: 1) Identification of existing remnant vegetation elements; 2) determination of remnant condition/viability; 3) assessment of what vegetation elements need to be added to achieve regional persistence and how this can be done - restoration/revegetation and; 4) on going monitoring/management.

 

 

Information already exists for several ecosystems regarding the amount and extent of remnant vegetation (step 1) (see Dongolocking Pilot Planning Project for Remnant Vegetation) and more information of this kind is becoming available through vegetation mapping projects.  Similarly, development of restoration methods (step 3) for some vegetation communities is underway, e.g. experimental development of salmon gum woodland regeneration techniques carried out as part of LWRRDC Remnant Veg 1.  In contrast, relatively little is known about what determines the viability and long-term conservation value of existing remnant vegetation or how this relates to landscape context.  Assessment of remnant vegetation status, viability and thresholds for maintenance of condition have been explicitly identified as research priorities necessary to develop successful landscape design and management principles in the Land and Water Australia, Native Vegetation Research and Development Program, Project Brief 1.

 

 

Most attempts to assess remnant vegetation viability or conservation value have been based on the use of presence/absence data to determine which remnants contain either large numbers of species, or have particular focal species that are thought to be particularly sensitive to fragmentation.  This approach, though easy to implement and useful in assessing current status, often fails to explicitly identify the biological factors limiting occurrence.  This makes it less able to predict species persistence - a key element to remnant viability, and to identify remedial actions - a primary consideration for remnant restoration.  Recent research results also suggest that remnant plant populations may undergo significant periods of decline before becoming extinct and that during this their presence will inflate viability assessments based solely on species presence or absence.  This decline often appears to be as a result of the combined effects of several processes such as inbreeding and pollination failure or mate limitation and demographic stochasticity, rather than one factor alone.

 

 

Given this, key research issues for remnant vegetation management are: i) identification of the biological processes limiting the viability of plant populations in vegetation remnants, ii) quantification of relationships between these and more easily measured landscape characteristics such as remnant size and landscape position and iii) determination of threshold values for remnant characteristics that will maximise population viability for a range of species with varied life histories.

<p>Three target taxa that vary in life history traits that are expected to affect ecological and genetic responses to fragmentation such as breeding system, reproductive and dispersal strategies, longevity or abundance, will be selected to represent broad life history classes (guilds) of plants.</p>
<p>Currently available vegetation survey and mapping databases (available from IMB CALM, Department of Agriculture and the Dongolocking Pilot Planning Project for Remnant Vegetation) will be used to select up to 10-20 vegetation remnants that contain the target taxa and that represent broad variation in remnant characteristics.  Main site variables to be investigated will be size, isolation and disturbance.  Additional information on population size and density will be collected from each site.</p>
<p>Within these remnant sites a combination of demographic monitoring and molecular genetic analysis will be employed to quantify ecological and genetic parameters that reflect population viability:</p>
<p>Genetic/breeding system parameters:</p>
<p>Genetic markers (allozymes, microsatellites or AFLPs) will be used to measure the amount of genetic variation in all populations, how genetically different populations are from each other, and to estimate the amount of gene flow among populations.  Measures of genetic diversity will include polymorphism (the proportion of polymorphic loci), allelic richness (the mean number of alleles per locus) and number of multilocus genotypes.  Interpopulation differentiation will be assessed as genetic distance.  Levels of inbreeding and patterns of mating will be assessed in a subset of up to ten populations per species sampled across the range of sizes and isolations.  This will involve using allozyme markers and/or microsatellites to estimate outcrossing rates, levels of correlated paternity and biparental inbreeding.</p>
<p>Various genetic diversity and population genetic structure statistics such as single locus diversity measures, F statistics, Nei's diversity measures, genetic distance, linkage disequilibrium, and their variances will be estimated through computer programs such as BIOSYS-1, GENESTAT, POPGENE, and GENEPOP.</p>
<p>Population genetic structure will also be estimated using maximum likelihood, UPGMA and Distance Wagner methods in BIOSYS and PHYLIP, and modified parsimony methods in FREQPAR.  Comparisons of genetic diversity measures between populations and species will be tested by ANOVA and relationships between genetic differentiation and geographical distance by Mantel tests.</p>
<p>Mating system parameters such as outcrossing rate ΔF and the correlated paternity and their variances for populations of each species will be estimated based on the mixed mating model using the computer program MLTR.</p>
<p>Ecological/fitness parameters:</p>
<p>Pollinator visitation and pollination rates, ovule to seed ratios, and seed production will be quantified in a subset of up to ten populations per species sampled across the range of sizes and isolations.  Where possible, seed from populations with varying levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding will be grown under controlled conditions to assess effects on seedling fitness.</p>
<p>The effect of plant population size, fragment connectivity and habitat disturbance on pollinator abundance, pollination rates and seed production will be tested with regression analysis and ANOVA in Minitab or SAS.</p>
<p>Ecological and genetic results will be correlated with landscape attributes using multiple regression models to identify remnant and landscape characteristics that are good predictors of demographic and genetic population viability.  Comparison of responses among target taxa will be used to identify life history traits that strongly influence ecological or genetic responses.  These two sets of responses (among-remnant and among-species) will be used to develop landscape attribute thresholds and design principles for maintenance of viable populations and the long-term persistence of remnant vegetation.</p>

The Walpole-Nornalup National Park contains large areas of old growth Karri, Jarrah and Tingle forest. The forests of the Walpole-Nornalup area are estimated to have a high proportion (approx. 75%, Van Heurck, Burbidge and Wheeler 2000) of arthropod species with Gondwanan affinities. These forests also contain a number of threatened and short-range endemic species. In these forests short-range endemics make up the majority of species in the following invertebrate groups: Gastropoda (snails), Oligochaeta (earthworms), Onychophora (velvet worms), Araneae (trapdoor and other spiders), Diplopoda (millipedes), Phreatoicidea (slaters) and Decapods (freshwater crayfish) (Harvey 2002). Little is known of the ability of these short-range endemic species and their litter communities to survive both wild and managed fires. Also no long term systematic survey of the fire impact on the species composition of the litter invertebrate communities of these forests has been carried out to date.

 

 

Recent worldwide estimates of the number of species of living organisms (Stork, 1999) are of the order of 12.5 million species (invertebrates, vertebrates and plants), of which 11 million are arthropod species. The inventory of arthropod species is therefore critical to the state’s requirement to conserve the biodiversity of regions such as the old growth forests. Recent bio-survey methods allow the simultaneous study of fire impacts on the majority of species of an entire ecosystem component such as the forest floor litter community. The advantage of this, is that a rapid inventory of species of a wide range of arthropod groups in the litter community of each site is achieved, in addition to determining fire impacts on any short-range endemics at each site, while also comparing the post-fire species composition between sites with a range of fire regimes. This allows extrapolation to other similar old-growth forest ecosystems containing short range endemic species, as well as predicting the impact of similar fire regimes and post-fire ages on the richness and species composition of entire litter arthropod communities in these nearby forests.

 

 

Following the March 2001 wildfire in the Nuyts Wilderness, a large group of local volunteers have been trapping and inventorying the litter arthropod species of these forest sites, as well as long unburnt sites nearby. This is establishing a comprehensive collection of local arthropod species and allowing the fire tolerances of these species to be determined. The outcome should be adaptive fire management of these old growth areas to conserve the full range of arthropod biodiversity. The extension of this study over a three year period will allow documentation of the early post-wildfire species succession.

Recent genetic work has suggested that the brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale nov sp) in Western Australia (the wambenger) is a distinct species when compared with eastern Australian and northern populations of Phascogale tapoatafa.  There is also some evidence that wambenger populations have declined recently, although the cause of these declines remains unknown. Whilst hypothetical ‘natural’ cyclical fluctuations may account for at least some of these declines it is also possible that management activities such as fox baiting, logging and/ or fire may also be causal factors. In this study the locality records of brush-tailed phascogales will be collated from museum and other sources and will be examined to determine if reporting frequency has declined recently and if so when. 

 

 

The brush-tailed phascogale was the subject of a PhD study by Susan Rhind.  Rhind (1994) studied the abundance of wambengers at 12 sites across the state and did a concentrated ecological study at Kingston and Perup forest areas in the Warren Region.  Since Rhind completed her studies trapping for wambengers in some of her sites has been continued by staff in the Warren Region.  In this study all the sites in which wambengers were previously captured will be reinvestigated to determine their current abundance. The abundance of wambengers in other sites will also be investigated.  These sites will either be unlogged and unbaited, unlogged and baited, or baited and logged.  No sites that are logged and unbaited could be found.

 

 

The potential impact that fox baiting programmes may have on populations of wambengers will be investigated.  In a captive study wambengers were fed both the currently used dried meat bait (DMB) and the new fox bait being developed by DCLM: ‘Probait’ (Martin et al. 2002).  Some wambengers consumed sufficient amounts of both bait types for them to be potentially at risk from baiting programs.  The risk from Probaits was higher than for dried meat baits.  Before Probaits can be used operationally the risk to wambengers in the field from this bait type needs to be quantified.  When an appropriately sized population of wambengers (a minimum of 32 individuals will be required to ensure that some statistical validity can be attributed to the results but as many individuals as possible will be used) has been identified the area will be baited with non-toxic, biomarker-labelled baits.  The wambengers in that area will then be captured and their whiskers examined for the presence of the biomarker.  The biomarker rhodamine will be used and this leaves a characteristic pink band in any animal that ingests it.  The proportion of wambengers that reveal the biomarker will indicate the number that would have been affected by a lethal baiting campaign and thus whether the population is at risk can be determined.  

 

 

The distributional and abundance data collected in this study will be used to determine the appropriate IUCN status for this species.  If applicable Phascogale nov sp. might be listed on the state and Commonwealth’s endangered fauna lists.

<p>i)          All available data on the distribution of wambengers will be collated and a distribution map for different time periods will be generated. Time frames may be pre 1960, 1961-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, &gt;1991. The frequency of sightings/ captures per time-frame will be quantified and will be analysed according to the type of sighting or capture. The sighting rate of another species that is known not to have declined during this time will be used as a benchmark to try to correct for anomalies in the sighting data. </p>
<p>ii)         The abundance of wambengers will be compared at 8 sites: (these have been tentatively identified as the following) three logged and baited sites (Yerramin, Topanup, Kingston 5); three unlogged, baited sites (Kingston 6, Perup 1 and Perup 2); and two unlogged, unbaited sites (Dingup and Frosty Rd). No logged, unbaited sites could be found.  The sampling effort will be a 1.5 by 1.5 km grid of nest boxes, with each nestbox 300m from the next Rhind (1994). The nest boxes will be checked for 4 consecutive nights. </p>
<p>iii)         An additional source of data on the presence of wambengers may be available through the routine Forestcheck monitoring that is currently undertaken on 6 transects on Smeetch Rd (6) at Perup and at the Thornton and Kingston sites.  There are 50 trap points at 200 m intervals on these transects.  By incorporating the results from that monitoring into this project it may be possible to get more information about wambengers and to further understand the reasons for their decline in the forest. </p>
<p>Investigations into the potential impact of fox baiting</p>
<p>i) Determination of the effectiveness of rhodamine as a biomarker for phascogales.</p>
<p>A sample of approximately 4 phascogales will be caught in nest boxes. They will be transported to the animal holding facilities at Agriculture WA at Forrestfield. They will be tested initially to determine their ‘background’ level of rhodamine (if any). They will then be fed a single Probait that has been labelled with rhodamine. They will be maintained on their normal diet for 2 weeks for the rhodamine to ‘label’ their whiskers.  Approximately 8-10 whiskers will be removed from each individual. The phascogale will be anaesthetised using Isofluorane during this procedure. Rhodamine leaves a pink band in the whiskers of individuals that ingest it and this can be detected with ultraviolet light.  The whiskers will be sent to VIAS in Victoria for confirmation of the presence of rhodamine. </p>
<p>ii) Field testing of Probaits </p>
<p>If the rhodamine labelling trails are successful, two sites will be aerially baited with non-toxic ‘Probaits’ that have been labelled with rhodamine. Each bait will contain 50mg of rhodamine that was added as a solution.  The standard baiting rate of 5 baits km-2 will be used. The areas to be used are yet to be identified or quantified (probably Kingston/ Perup). The phascogale densities in each of these sites will be assessed in February and the actual sites to be used will then be identified.  Individuals that will be used for testing the ingestion of rhodamine will be obtained from the site that is not used in the main experiment. </p>
<p>Phascogales will be trapped in both sites approximately 2 weeks after the delivery of the biomarker labelled baits.  Individuals will be caught in nest boxes that have been strategically positioned throughout the sites. When captured each individual will have approximately 8-10 whiskers removed. They will be anaesthetised using Isoflourane during this procedure.  Approximately 100-120 nest boxes will be present in each site. The proportion of the population that can be ‘removed’ by baits without affecting population viability will be determined by population viability analysis.  If this level of ingestion is exceeded then alternative methods of controlling foxes in areas where phascogales are present will need to be devised.</p>",required,False,<p>Any wambenger that dies unexpectedly during the experiment will be lodged with the museum.

The Order Oligochaeta (earthworms) was one of 6 terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate taxa whose native fauna were noted by Harvey (2002) to consist principally of short range endemic species. These species have small ranges (less than 10,000 km2). In the case of native Western Australian earthworms, ranges smaller than 100 km2 are common (Abbott and Wills 2002, Wills and Abbott 2003). Poor powers of dispersal and confinement to discontinuous habitats are characteristics of taxa containing high numbers of short-range endemics. These characteristics leave short-range endemic species vulnerable to habitat change or destruction and hence elevate them in priority for conservation research in areas where their habitats may be threatened. 

 

 

The vegetation and hydrology of the Swan Coastal Plain have undergone extensive modification since European settlement. 21 native species of native earthworms from 136 sites have been recovered in a study of the SCP in the Perth metropolitan area. However, an estimate of the diversity prior to European settlement is as high as 38 species, almost double that recovered from systematic survey of remaining native vegetation in the Perth sector of the coastal plain. By this estimate, it is possible that the fate of at least half the earthworm diversity depends on survival in areas either cleared of native vegetation or vegetation otherwise considered to have no conservation significance. While some native earthworm species can survive in disturbed areas such as pastures most native species tend to be scarcer in disturbed habitats. 

 

 

A primary step in the conservation of short-range endemic species is their identification through biotic surveys. We have surveyed the Perth metropolitan sector of the SCP for native earthworms, however the southern and northern parts of the SCP outside the Perth metropolitan area remain unsurveyed. The logistical requirements of comprehensive survey are not trivial. Species accumulation in regional samples is linear up to sample intensities of about 1 site per square kilometre. Sampling large regional areas at this intensity is clearly impractical. Regional sampling at the rate of 1 sample per 30-100 km2 is achievable. A modest sampling program is proposed involving a week of field work a year by two persons during June to August (depending on rainfall) over a period of 3 years. This would require an annual budget of $1600 comprising accommodation expenses of $1000 and vehicle costs of $600.

 

 

 

Documenting the terrestrial Oligochaete fauna of the entire Swan Coastal Plain will enhance the conservation of native Oligochaetes, a taxon likely to contain species vulnerable to habitat modification, by identifying species with restricted ranges. The project will do this by accumulating earthworm distribution and diversity data and evaluating the adequacy of the system of formal and informal conservation areas for terrestrial Oligocheate conservation.

As an example, in south eastern Australia the Gippsland giant earthworm Megascolides australis, whose biology and distribution is relatively well known, is recorded as vulnerable or threatened on the following instruments: Listed on ‘Schedule 1 - Listed Species’ ‘Part 2 – Species that are vulnerable’ under the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; listed as threatened on Schedule 2 of the Victoria Fauna &amp; Flora Guarantee Act 1988.</p>

The principal features used were: setal arrangement - perichaetine or with 8 setal rows; segmentation - tripartite or unipartite segments; number and arrangement of accessory genital markings about the male pores on 18th segment; and number and arrangement of accessory markings on 8th to 12th segments, usually markings in the intersegmental folds. Voucher specimens for species and morphospecies are lodged at the Western Australian Museum, with duplicates, if available, lodged at the Australian Museum and the CALM collection.</p>
<p>Soils: Soil samples will be collected at each site by bulking a series of twenty 1.5 cm diameter cores at depths of 0-10 cm and 40-50 cm. Cores will collected from areas in the vicinity of where earthworms have been collected after moving aside litter down to first signs of mineral soil. </p>
<p>Samples will be dried and coarse matter (&gt; 2 mm) separated by sieve. Coarse organic matter will be separated from coarse mineral matter by flotation in water. Fractions of particle sizes less than 2 mm will be determined using the pipette method.

One of the overall aims of the Forest Management Plan 2004-2013 is to protect soil and water resources in forested areas to which the Plan applies. Key performance indicator (KPI) 20 is the percentage of waterbodies (e.g. stream kilometres, lake hectares) with significant variance of biodiversity from the historic range of variability. The intent of KPI20 is to provide a measure of the success of the Forest Management Plan in protecting the ecological integrity and quality of streams.

 

 

The rationale behind this project is that logging and fire frequently cause changes to stream conditions and, consequently, their ecology. Sedimentation and opening up of canopy are usually the greatest causes of impact (see Halse and Blyth 1992), with much of the sediment coming from roads crossing streams.

 

 

The project addresses KPI20 by monitoring aquatic macroinvertebrates and measuring various aspects of water physico-chemistry at 40-50 sites in spring each year. The protocol being used is based on AUSRIVAS and AUSRIVAS models will be used to assess the degree of disturbance in the streams subject to monitoring (Halse _et al_. 2001).

 
","<p>The objective of KPI 20 is to assess the success of the implementation of the Forest Management Plan 2004-2013 in protecting the ecological integrity and quality of streams. The specific criteria to be used in assessing success are:</p>
<p>Indicator - <em>Percentage of water bodies (e.g. stream kilometres) with significant variance of biodiversity from the historic range of variability</em></p>
<p>Biodiversity Measure - <em>The diversity of aquatic macro-invertebrate fauna at a selected number of monitoring sites</em></p>
<p>Performance Target - <em>No sites with fauna significantly different from the reference condition</em></p>",<p>Project will monitor whether CALM is meeting FMP commitments with regard to maintaining forest stream biodiversity. It will also provide information on forest stream biodiversity and add to knowledge of the occurrence and distribution of the State’s biota.</p>,"<p>(1) Monitoring results will be used by SFM and the EPA to assess compliance with the FMP. (2) Information on pattern of aquatic invertebrate occurrence will be used by CALM to examine adequacy of forest reserve system, and to compile lists of Threatened Ecological Communities and Rare or Priority Taxa. (3) Information on response of stream communities to fire, logging and dams will be used by FPC, SFM and Water Corporation to improve management of forestry activities, burning regimes and water harvesting. (4) Project results will be disseminated by: A. circulating progress reports annually to appropriate agency staff B. formal reporting of results to SFM and the EPA every five years C. scientific publications as appropriate </p>","<p><strong>Annual</strong></p>

This consists of unvegetated river banks and the central portion of the stream. Macroinvertebrates will be collected by 10 m of sweeping with a pond net, the sample will be washed and elutriated and then sub-sampled using a box sampler until 200 animals have been randomly encountered. All macroinvertebrates will be identified to family level and animals of the orders/families Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Odonata and Chironomidae identified to species. These groups are amenable to species identification because keys exist and they are either known to be sensitive to water quality change or species-rich. Family level identifications are used in AUSRIVAS models and the species data will be used to examine biodiversity trends in more detail. Overall, methodology will follow that of Halse <em>et al.</em> (2001).</p>
<p>Data on site characteristics has been compiled for all sites. Things documented include tenure, forest type (jarrah or karri), logging and fire history, soil type, slope and expected impacts. In addition to macroinvertebrates, water quality data will be collected, including salinity, nutrients, pH, temperature, turbidity and dissolved oxygen.</p>
<p>The distribution of the 46 sites sampled in 2005 is shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 provides a breakdown of forest type, occurrence in CALM regions, land tenure, reason for monitoring and expected impacts. The initial basis for site selection was to examine sites previously sampled during the 1994-1999 AUSRIVAS program, for which some existing data are available. Only sites where discharge was less than 100,000 ML per annum were included. However, the project required a set of sites that are representative of forest conditions and a series of other selection criteria were imposed. These included that ca 75% of sites should be in jarrah forest, 25% in karri; ca 60% of sites should be in areas subject to logging and 40% in unlogged areas; sites should be spread across the forested area; a small number of sites should examine the impact of dams; a small number of sites should be located in areas that experienced wildfire last summer so that the impact of intense burns could be examined; a small number of sites should be in areas to be logged this year or next year so that the impact of logging could be examined. In order to fulfill the above criteria, it was necessary to include a number of sites not sampled during AUSRIVAS.</p>
<p>A small number of sites will be added to the program in 2006, after consultation with DoE and Water Corporation to examine the impact of Yarragadee extraction. This will include sites on St John’s Brook, Milyeannup Creek and Poison Gully. There will also be consideration of whether sites on bauxite, and other mining, leases should be included.</p>

The abundance of some species of fauna increased significantly in several areas in Western Australia following the introduction of fox control.  However, the recovery of a number of species e.g. the woylie _(Bettongia penicillata)_ has not been sustained despite maintained fox control regimes. The suite of factors potentially responsible for the decline of these populations will be investigated in two fragmented wheatbelt reserves; Dryandra Woodland and Tutanning Nature Reserve.  The factors to be investigated include fox, feral cat, python and raptor predation. The survival of woylies (#KTBA) will be modelled as a function of these factors.  Woylies will be trapped regularly in cage traps. They will also be fitted with mortality sensing radio-collars and the factors responsible for their demise or lack of recruitment identified. 

 

 

 

Fox and feral cat abundance will be monitored at sandplots and DNA analysis will be used to identify individuals from scats, saliva and fur. Sandplots will be monitored each quarter, following the regular fox baiting program.  Foxes and feral cats, when detected, will be trapped and fitted with satellite collars (resources permitting).  Their movements will be monitored continuously and their interactions (if any) and habitat partitioning identified.  The predominate timing of reinvasion and the presence of bait wary foxes (if any) will be identified.

 

 

 

The effectiveness of the current fox baiting regime will be investigated by analysing the uptake and longevity of baits.  The 1080 content of baits and their degradation following rain will be examined.

682,"Ravensthorpe Range survey
","There are currently over 30 proposals to explore, commence or enlarge existing iron ore operations on Banded Ironstone Ranges in southern Western Australia. The demand is being driven by sustained growth in China that is expected to continue well into the future. A feature of these rapidly developing markets has been the desire by proponents for expedited approvals to lock in current high commodity prices.

As geological features the Banded Iron Formations in the Mid-West and Yilgarn regions form a series of isolated peaks and ranges in an ancient and generally subdues regional landscape.

The knowledge of the biodiversity significance of these environments is far from complete, but what is known indicates that these isolated peaks are behaving as important refugia for flora and fauna, they are a focus for rare and priority species, and restricted vegetation communities including some recognized as Threatened Ecological Communities, and are likely to support short range endemic fauna (Bennett (1987), Gibson et al. (1997), Gibson & Lyons (1998ab), Gibson & Lyons (2001a,b), Portman (2002), Butcher et al., 2003, Gibson (2004ab)). The loss of these landscapes on a regional scale will therefore result in the loss of unique and regionally significant flora and vegetation

At present there is no regional quantative dataset that covers the extent of the Banded Ironstone Ranges in sufficient detail to allow assessment of regional conservation significance of individual mining proposals. While the earlier work of CALM and Portman provide this overview in Mt Jackson – Bungalbin area, this only covers a portion of the extent of BIF in the Yilgarn.

There is an urgent need to develop such a dataset in order to facilitate the timely assessment of development proposals.

This project will establish a further 50 quadrats on each of 6 ranges highly prospective for minerals. These data will allow assessment of regional significance of the flora and vegetation of these areas and be available to assist in the environmental assessment of future proposed developments. Little of these data are currently available leading to delays in the environmental approval process.

Similar surveys undertaken by CALM in the eastern Goldfields and the MidWest region have lead to identification of species new to science, new populations of threatened flora and the identification of potentially threatened vegetation communities restricted to unusual geologies.

Sites will only established where road access was adequate.  Plots will be placed on the crests, slopes and outwashes associated with the ranges, and will be placed strategically to encompass the topological profile of the ranges and the general range of variation of geological landforms and associated vegetation communities in the area. A similar method has been used to survey greenstone and ironstone ranges in the eastern goldfields (Gibson 2004, Gibson and Lyons 2001).</p>
<p>Quadrats will be marked with four steel fence droppers and position marked by GPS and photographed at a set distance (0 – 5m) near each corner. The presence and cover of all vascular plant species (angiosperms, gymnosperms and pteridiophytes) will be recorded in each plot, with material collected for verification at the Western Australian Herbarium. Vegetation structure was described according to McDonald et al. (1998). All data on topographical position, aspect, slope, % litter, % bare ground, % rock cover class of both surface deposits and exposed bedrock, shape of surface rock fragments, soil colour and soil texture will be noted according to the definitions of McDonald et al. (1998). Percentage surface rock fragment cover class (Rock Frag), maximum rock fragment size (MxR) and exposed bedrock outcrop cover will be all coded on a semi-quantitative scale. Percentage surface rock fragment cover classes will be scored on six point scale; 0 % cover (0); &lt; 2 % cover (1); 2 – 10%, (2); 10 – 20% (3); 20 – 50% (4); 50 – 90% (5); &gt; 90% (6). Maximum rock size was classed on a six point scale; 2 – 6 mm (1); 6 – 20 mm (2); 20 – 60 mm (3); 60 – 200 mm (4); 200 – 600 mm (5); 600 mm – 2m (6). Leaf litter and bare ground will be visual estimates of the percentage of ground cover. Topographic position (Tp) in the landscape was coded on a six point scale which was semi-quantitative: outwash (1); lower slope (2); mid slope (3), upper slope or low ridge (4), crest (5).</p>
<p>For each plot a bulked soil sample was collected, this being complied from 20 smaller samples collected regularly over the area of the plot. Soils will be analysed if sufficient funds are available for a suite of 12 elements at the Chemistry Centre of Western Australia, using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP AES). This will involve the simultaneous determination of a suite of elements (P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Na, B, Co, Cu, Fe, Mg and Zn) using the Mehlich No. 3 soil test procedure (Melich 1984, Walton and Allen 2004).  Soil pH will also be determined 0.01M CaCl2, and effective cation exchange capacity (eCEC) will be calculated from the summation of exchangeable bases after multiplication of each base (Na, Ca, K and Mg) by a set standard constant (Rayment and Higginson 1992, Soil and Plant Council, 1999).</p>
<p>Pattern analysis will be conducted on a presence / absence data matrix of the perennial taxa, the singleton and annual taxa will be omitted from the data matrix prior to analysis. Singletons (taxa that appeared in a single plot) will be omitted as these contain little information. Annuals will be excluded because their distribution and abundance is a function of rainfall in the previous season (Mott 1972, 1973, Beard 1990). The omission of annuals allows for these results to be comparable with other data collected from other seasons and years, and is consistent with previous surveys on other greenstone and ironstone communities (Gibson and Lyons 1998, 2001, Gibson 2004). Resemblance matrices, using the Bray Curtis measure of association, will be compared using the 2 Stage algorithm in Primer (Clark and Gorley 2006) to confirm that there was little information being lost from the dataset by the omission of these taxa.</p>
<p>Pattern analysis will be conducted using PATN (V3.03) (Belbin 1989). The Bray-Curtis coefficient will be used for the association matrix for sites and species classification and the semi-strong hybrid (SSH) multidimensional scaling for ordination of sites (Belbin 1991). The agglomerative, hierarchical clustering was used to generate a species and site classification, using flexible UPGMA (β = -0.1) (Sneath and Sokal 1973). A sorted two-way table will be generated that was ordered by these site and species classifications. Three dimensional semi-strong hybrid (SSH) multidimensional scaling was implemented for the ordination of the presence / absence quadrat data, using 1000 random starts and 50 iterations.</p>
<p>Principal Component Correlation (PCC) (www.patn.com.au) runs multiple linear regression of extrinsic variables on the three dimensional ordination (Belbin 1989). The environmental variables will be not standardized or transformed before PCC analysis as the Monte-Carlo procedure (MCAO) was employed in PATN as a bootstrap analysis to evaluate the significance of these correlation coefficients. This will be done by implementing PCC on the same ordination using a simulated dataset of randomized values for each environmental variable (Belbin 1989). The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance will be used to determine differences in environmental parameters among floristic community groups, followed by Dunn’s posthoc multiple comparisons test when required to identify dissimilar groups (Zar 1984). Indicator species analysis (INDVAL) will be calculated using PC-Ord (McCune and Mefford 1999), using the methods of Dufrene and Legendre (1997). These INDVAL measures will be used to determine the significant indicator species for each floristic community type.</p>",required,False,<p>Estimated number of vouchered specimens: 1750</p>,not required,False,not required,<p>The data will be archived at Woodvale.

725,"Terrestrial Baselining the Avon Project (P Gioia)
"," 

This project was tendered for by Stuart Halse in 2005, in response to an Expression of Interest (EOI) put out by the Avon Catchment Council for a project titled “ND001 Getting started: “Baselining” the region’s natural diversity”. This EOI was developed in response to Management Action Targets (MAT’s) in the Avon Natural Resource Management Strategy (Avon Catchment Council, 2005). 

 

 

For the wetland component, the following Management Action Target was requested to be addressed:

 

 

W2.2.2 - Major salt lakes and other wetlands of regional significance in the Avon River Basin are identified and characterized based on hydrological and ecological criteria.

 

 

Apart from the Salinity Action Plan Wheatbelt Biological Survey and Monitoring Program (Pinder et al. 2004) little information was available on the vast numbers of wetlands in the Avon NRM region. This project partially filled this gap by providing an inventory of the wetlands in the region, with up to date mapping and classification of wetlands into groups based on hydrology, landform and other physical characteristics. It also provided a broad-scale evaluation of the conservation significance of basin and granite outcrop wetlands to enable strategic catchment planning in the region.

 
","<p>The wetlands component of the Avon Baselining Project had the following aims:</p>
<p>1.     Map every wetland in the Avon NRM region at a scale of 1:10,000, so that it is accurate to be used at a scale of 1:100,000. This includes the attribution of the landscape setting of these wetlands (amount of buffer vegetation, connectivity of vegetation, surrounding impacts, existing data available, hydrology etc.). This mapping was conducted in collaboration with the Wheatbelt Wetlands Project run by Nature Conservation Division.</p>
<p>2.     Develop a method for conducting regional-scale (Stage 1) wetland classification and conservation significance evaluation for wetlands greater than one hectare in the Avon Catchment (compatible with the WA Wetland Status Working Group’s Framework for Mapping, Classification and Evaluation of Wetlands in Western Australia [DEC 2007]).</p>
<p>3.     Use the above to classify and evaluate conservation significance of every basin, granite outcrop and reservoir wetland greater than one hectare.</p>
<p>4.     Develop a method for conducting on-ground (stage 3) wetland classification and conservation significance evaluations of inundated basin wetlands in the Avon NRM region (compatible with the WA Wetland Status Working Group’s Framework for Mapping, Classification and Evaluation of Wetlands in Western Australia [DEC 2007]).</p>
<p>The following three aims were added after additional funds were obtained from the Avon NRM.</p>
<p>5.     Test the above stage 3 method on a number of representative wetlands.</p>
<p>6.     Produce a literature review that documents what is currently known about the flow-on effects of agricultural drainage on basin wetlands. In particular, the effects of altered salinity, pH, hydrology, sediment and nutrient loads on aquatic invertebrate, waterbird and vegetation communities.</p>
<p>7.     Produce a colour guide to waterbirds and aquatic invertebrates inhabiting wetlands in the Avon NRM region, aimed at landholders and the general public.</p>","<ol>

","The biodiversity values of the Ravensthorpe Range are poorly documented and the area is highly prospective for mineral exploration and mining. The range is know for high number of both threatened and/or locally endemic plant species. There is no consistent flora dataset available across the range making assessment impacts on of mining proposals difficult. Each of the recent mining development in the area had significant threatened flora and vegetation issues. While our knowledge of the flora and vegetation of the Range is limited even less is known of the patterns in the short range endemic invertebrates on the range.

 The proposed survey would establish 200 quadrats across the range to allow regional assessment of flora and vegetation. At a subset of sites invertebrates would also be collected. These data would allow an assessment of regional significance of the flora, vegetation and short range endemic invertebrates and be available to assist in the environmental assessment of future proposed developments.

","The terrestrial vertebrate component of the Kingston Project (SPP 1993/115) employs a replicated BACI (Before, After, Control, Impact) design. Intensive field work was conducted 1994-2000. Timber-harvesting occurred in 1995-1996. Pit and Elliott trapping for small vertebrates ceased in 2000. Cage trapping to monitor medium-sized mammals has continued on about 4-yearly intervals (i.e. 2004/05 and 2009). In so doing, responses to timber harvesting has been quantified 1-2 years pre-harvesting, 1-2 years during harvesting disturbance and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 13 years post disturbance. Spotlight surveys to monitor less readily captured mammals, particularly ngwayir and koomal, have been conducted along three transects since 1996 and were particularly intensive in 1997-2000. Since 2004 6 surveys per annum have been sustained on each of the three transects.

This concept plan has been prepared to replace SPP 1993/115 and provide for completion of data analysis and publication of results for the period 1996 to 2011. This will be the immediate priority for work in 2012/13. Subject to confirmation that the experimental design is robust and can be extended, the study may be expanded to examine the response of vertebrates to harvesting of mature forest retained as exclusion strips during the 1996 operation. These strips are considered important in mediating the impact of timber harvesting on arboreal mammals and birds. Understanding how fauna will respond to a further harvest cycle in important in informing the current sustainable forest management objectives.

Associated environmental responses have included dropping groundwater levels (Hughes et al. 2012), decreases in streamflow (Petrone et al. 2010), forest die-off in vulnerable parts of forest (Matusick et al. 2013, 2016; Ruthrof et al. 2015), and a range of secondary effects following forest die-off (Ruthrof et al. 2016; Hopkins et al. 2018; Walden et al. 2019). Forest die-off is particularly concerning, given the importance of the forest ecosystem for carbon sequestration, timber production, recreation, habitat, and a range of ecosystem services, including water.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent work by DBCA has shown a decline in vegetation density in the eastern portion of the forest ecosystem, specifically the following forest ecosystems: Jarrah North East; Jarrah North West; and, Western Wandoo Forest and Woodlands (Conservation and Parks Commission 2019). Previous research in the north-eastern forest suggests that key canopy species, <em>Eucalyptus marginata</em> and <em>Corymbia calophylla,</em> are susceptible to frost (Matusick et al. 2016). In the same region, <em>E. wandoo</em> has been undergoing a series of declines in health, associated with drought and increasing temperatures (Brouwers et al. 2013). In addition, <em>E. wandoo</em> has been affected by a Buprestid beetle, <em>Cisseis fascigera</em> (Hooper and Sivasithamparam 2005; Hooper et al. 2010), which is thought to become active when vapour pressure deficits (VPD) levels reach a particular level and trees become drought-stressed (Hooper 2009). An associated fungal pathogen is also suspected in the decline of this eucalypt (Hooper and Sivasithamparam 2005) but has not yet been identified and described.</p>
<p>Although these patterns of tree decline are broadly consistent with climate change prediction models, other factors may also be contributing. Little is known about the landscape, site, and stand characteristics that predispose forest to decline. Without this, we cannot predict how the forest will respond to further climate change in the future. This project will build on the information gained from preliminary examination of vegetation decline, investigate the cause/s and further quantify contributions by other factors. This will provide a greater understanding of the vulnerability of the forest to climate change and assist in developing evidence-based management intervention techniques. The project has four key areas: 1) trend map investigation; 2) forest validation; 3) trajectories in recovery post-fire; and 4) climatic influences.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Trend map investigation.</strong> The decline trend in forest vegetation cover over the period of the previous Forest Management Plan, which was revealed via remote sensing, will be examined against landscape characteristics including fire history, aspect, elevation, soil types, and other topographic variables. Interactions may be important in this regard, such as aspect combined with time needed to recover from fire.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Forest validation.</strong> Declining and stable forest plots identified via remote sensing will be examined in the field. Site and stand level characteristics investigated will include soil type, vegetation type, stand structure, stand composition, stand and tree health, and fire impacts. The information from the on-ground forest survey will be used to test and validate the remote sensing analysis, so that we have a high level of confidence in what is being detected via remote sensing, and so that remote sensing, combined with Departmental datasets, can be utilised to identify similar areas of decline, or vulnerable forest sites.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Post-fire recovery.</strong> The speed of vegetation recovery from disturbance events, such as fire, may be influencing the trend of cover at particular sites. That is, different forest ecosystem types recover at different rates following disturbance, depending on factors such as site index (i.e. productivity), which is dependent on rainfall, soil type, elevation, slope, etc. Furthermore, the recovery from a particular fire event is also dependent on a range of factors such as ecosystem type. These nuances in forest responses to fire will be investigated and incorporated into trend analysis in the future, and included in the next FMP if necessary.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Climatic influences.</strong> Although the forest is responding to climate change, the climatic factors responsible for acute and chronic forest decline need to be investigated. If vegetation thresholds at particular sites during key climatic events or trends can be understood, then it may be possible to project this understanding into the future and predict when and where the forest will respond with a decline in vegetation cover.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The aim of this SPP is to <em>investigate the cause/s of decline in vegetation density and further examine contributions by other factors</em>. This will be achieved through the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Further understand the temporal and spatial trends in the forest vegetation cover and identifying declining, and stable, forest plots in key ecosystem types;</li>
<li>Investigate the factors contributing to vegetation cover decline, and validating remote sensing data with ground-based measurements;</li>
<li>Examine the recovery time of key forest ecosystem types to different fire intensities; and,</li>
<li>Investigate the climatic drivers that have occurred in the vicinity of forest decline.</li>
</ol>","<p>This project will improve our understanding of the extent and causes of forest vegetation decline and hence our ability to predict how the forest will respond to future climate change, and management intervention. This part of the SPP (Aims 1, 2 and 4) directly address the Forest Management Plan Mid-Term Review KPI1, Recommendation 1: That the <em>Department further investigates the cause of decline in vegetation density and provide further information to the Commission on the factors that may have contributed to the outcomes of lower vegetation density in the affected forest ecosystems by January 2021.</em> In addition, these objectives directly align with the Science Strategic Plan 2018-21, as they will develop a clearer understanding of the impacts of climate change on the forest ecosystem<em>.</em></p>
<p>By investigating the responses and recovery of different forest types to different fire intensities (Objective 3), we can incorporate new information into planning for intervention in the future. The objective directly contributes to the Ecosystem Science Program Plan 2018-21 via: Program Approach: Conduct research into the physical and ecological processes mediating the impacts of climate change and the responses of the biota to inform mitigation strategies. This SPP accomplishes this through conducting research of the responses of biota to inform mitigation strategies.</p>

<li><strong><em> Trend map investigation:</em></strong> To examine the trend in declining vegetation cover the rate of decline will firstly be converted to a quantitative change in vegetation cover. To do this, calibration sites, which will constitute approximately 100, 90 by 90 m polygons, will be located across the Northern Jarrah Forest. At each of these sites, canopy-cover estimates, calculated via automated methods from aerial photography, will be regresses against indices from Landsat imagery. Once an index has been chosen (the highest r<sup>2</sup> value against canopy cover), the highest levels of decline can then be identified across the FMP area. Landscape attributes for different forest ecosystem types and levels of decline will subsequently be investigated, such as aspect, elevation, soil type. In addition, declining and stable polygons will be identified and points within those randomly chosen for the field survey (below).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><strong><em> Forest validation:</em></strong> To validate what is being identified by remote sensing, an appropriately scaled survey will be developed. That is, Landsat-derived data is at the 30m x 30m pixel size and this scale needs to be incorporated into field measurements. Declining and stable forest areas (polygons of at least 4 Landsat pixels) will be identified via remote sensing, plots (variable radius plots) within those pixels selected randomly, and then surveyed. Plot characteristics recorded will be those most likely to influence reflectance, while also capturing the ecological characteristics necessary to determine the potential drivers of decline. Stand-scale characteristics that will be included are: overstorey, midstorey and understorey (dominant) species present, percent cover (rock, litter, CWD, soil, canopy), and health, size (height, DBH), and percent die-off of a number of larger canopy trees, in addition to the level of resprouting and sizes of dead branches (in order to assist with carbon loss measurements). In addition, representative sites will be chosen, and a stand sweep will be undertaken by FMB staff, in order to synchronise methods used between Science and FMB, and to make the overall results applicable to much larger forest management questions and across larger scale. Declining and stable plots will be compared at the landscape scale (e.g. aspect, fire history, elevation etc) and stand scales. Non-normally distributed variables will be analysed using non-parametric methods to determine the difference between groups. For others, mixed effects models, using site as a random factor, will be used. Multiple comparison tests can then be used to determine differences.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><strong><em> Postfire recovery:</em></strong> Different forest ecosystem types recover following fire at different rates and depend on a number of landscape and site factors. Expected recovery curves from prescribed burns or wildfires for each forest ecosystem type would give the ability to determine where changes from the expected recovery are occurring. Firstly, a number of sites will be chosen within key forest ecosystem types, ideally across the precipitation gradient that naturally occurs across the forest management area. Recovery of vegetation cover will then be tracked over a time series, pre to post burn, using one of the spectral indices available, for example, i35 (Van Dongen et al. 2019). Secondly, this will be undertaken at sites with different levels of fire severity (e.g. extreme wildfires c/w prescribed burns). This recovery time can then be incorporated into trend maps for each forest ecosystem type.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>4.Climate influences</em></strong><strong>:</strong> The ability for independent variables (e.g. precipitation, SPEI [standardised precipitation and evapotranspiration index], VPD [vapour pressure deficit] and the long-term changes in these variables to predict tree die-off will be tested using a logistic regression modelling approach. Other variables, in addition to the long-term changes in SPEI and VPD over time, will also be tested.&nbsp;</p>

Accurate and effective identification of specimens of plant and animal taxa is essential for biodiversity survey, ecology, conservation assessment, and almost all other branches of biological research that require a taxonomic assignment of specimens. In particular, surveys conducted as part of the environmental assessment process, such as by environmental consultants working on development approvals, require that identifications of plants be accurate and can be done in an efficient and timely manner. Without accuracy in identifications, the presence and occurrence of rare or other conservation-listed taxa in development areas may be missed, resulting in negative conservation outcomes; conversely, the presence and occurrence of such taxa outside development zones may also be missed without effective means of identification, with negative consequences for resource development and planning.

 

In addition to these formal uses of identification tools, broad community engagement with plant biodiversity is enhanced by the availability of simple, effective and accessible means of identifying wildflowers and other plants. Many botanical resources such as floras and their identification keys are relatively inaccessible and intractable for community users. The development of user-friendly and accessible identification keys helps encourage active community participation in this area.

 

 

While a number of platforms and mechanisms exist for identification of specimens, this project focuses on two, the the Lucid suite of programs (http://www.lucidcentral.org), and the IdentifyLife platform (http://www.identifylife.org). Lucid is a mature and globally recognized software suite for creating, managing and deploying computer-aided interactive identification tools. IdentifyLife is a new, web-based collaborative framework for managing the descriptive data that underpins interactive identification keys.

 

 

The project has is developing and deploying keys to some of the largest and most important families of flowering plants in Western Australia.

Firstly, accurate, effective and efficient identification tools bring benefits both to DEC staff and to key DEC clients, particularly the environmental consultants community. Secondly, provision of user-friendly and accessible identification tools encourages broad community engagement with the plant biodiversity of Western Australia and increases linkages between DEC and the community.</p>","<p>A wide range of users engage with the identification tools produced as part of this project, from professional researchers and environmental consultants to university and school students and members of the general public.

706,,"This project will provide important information on the recovery of the New Zealand fur seal (NZFS), and to a lesser extent, Australian sea lion (ASL) populations which were reduced to near extinction in WA due to commercial harvesting in the 19 & 20^th^ centuries. These data are essential for wildlife managers to effectively conserve these protected species under the NRM priority of Recovering Biodiversity and also will give essential information to manage interactions with commercial fishing activities under the NRM priority Enhanced Protection of Marine and coastal environment, and to a lesser extent provide important information relevcant to the Commonwealth draft recovery plan for the Australian sea lion, and for the South-west regional Marine Park management plan.

 

Changes in abundance and distribution of the NZFS have been observed over the past ten years and extensions to the range appear to be occurring along the south-west coast. The timing of this survey is consistent with the planned management of this species as outlined in the Pinniped Management Plan (PMP, Campbell & Gales in prep.) and methodology will follow that of the previous two surveys (Gales et al. 2000). This will be the third survey of this species over the past 20 years and is urgently required. This will allow us to better understand the patterns of population expansion over the last 10 years and to predict likely patterns of future population expansion and areas of interaction. Information on the breeding schedule of the ASL will also be collected and is a priority area of research for this listed Threatened species in both the draft State PMP and the Commonwealth draft recovery plan (DEWHA 2010). The expansion of the NZFS population into warmer waters and outside of the historical distribution provides some important indications of how different species will respond to climate change. 

 

The results from this project and further biological information will be publicly presented at a number of forums to develop a greater awareness and understanding of the biology of the two resident seal species in WA. Possible approaches to mitigate interactions with fishing gear and reduce incidental mortality as well as reducing product loss for the commercial fishers will be discussed. There are concerns among many commercial fishers about the rise in interactions with NZFS in particular, including the depredation of target prey and the ecological consequences of such an increase in abundance of this marine predator. In addition, there are some concerns over the proximity of new haulout and breeding areas of NZFS to popular aquatic recreation areas (Cape Naturaliste & Rottnest Is), and the potential increase in NZFS predators (great white sharks) in these areas.

689,,"1\. The ecology of temperate intertidal reef platforms

As the inter-face between marine and terrestrial environments, wave-cut intertidal reefs are a harsh environment, and the distinctive composition of temperate intertidal reef communities reflects both the ability of organisms to tolerate a relatively wide range of physical conditions and the consequences of biological processes such as recruitment, competition and predation (Dakin & Bennett 1987, Edgar 2001).

The pronounced vertical distribution of intertidal organisms typically relates to their capacity to tolerate relatively predictable tidal cycles of exposure, inundation and wave action. Hence, species diversity on the high intertidal is low and typically restricted to desiccation-resistant molluscs (such as _Austrolittorina _and _Nodilittorina),_ while organisms of particular abundance on the rarely exposed reef crest (such as _Haliotis roei)_ are more robust to the effects of high wave energy (Edgar 2001, 2008). On the broader reef platform, even small variations in height relative to the tide datum can lead to significant differences in environment conditions caused by varying degrees of tidal exposure. Hence, organisms are commonly also patchily distributed across the seemingly minor depressions, rock-pools and ridges that occur on most reef platforms (Britton et al. 1988). In addition to tidal influences, intertidal reef habitats are also subject to less predictable episodic disturbances from, for example, strong wave action, sand deposition and relatively extreme temperatures (Dayton 1971), which may result in localised or widespread mortality among intertidal organisms (Hodgkin 1959a, Leviten & Kohn 1980, Kohn 1993). Such disturbances can act to maintain community heterogeneity across a range of scales (Lubchenco & Menge 1978). The biological communities of shoreline platform reefs may also be influenced by terrestrial factors, such as freshwater aquifer discharge, particularly if these sources are polluted (Johannes 1980).

Complex biological processes such as recruitment, competition, herbivory and predation also strongly influence the structure of intertidal communities (Dayton 1971, Lubchenco & Menge 1978). While larval recruitment to reef platforms may vary depending on life-cycle traits (such as direct or pelagic larval development), the availability of space and competition between organisms for space are major factors that structure intertidal reef communities. Early life stages of many organisms, for example, may require suitable settlement habitat (Raimondi 1990), while some species are competitively dominant over others (Dayton 1971). Intra-specific competition among cohorts may also affect community composition (Boventura et al. 2003). The potential dominance of competitively successful species may in turn be restricted by herbivory, predation or disturbance events.

Direct human interactions can also impact on intertidal reef habitats, which are often easily accessible from the shore. Such impacts may comprise the trampling of organisms by repeated access or their removal by collecting (Robinson 2005). Platform reefs support some important recreational and commercial fishery species, such as Roe’s abalone Haliotis roei while other species may be taken for bait or by shell collectors (Keough et al. 1991, Hancock & Caputi 2006).

2\. Intertidal reefs in temperate Western Australia.

While wave sculpted intertidal platform reefs are a feature of many temperate Australian rocky shores, their presence and structure depends on the wave exposure and the underlying geology (Dakin & Bennett 1987). Hence, while such platform reefs are relative uncommon along WA’s predominantly granitic south coast, they are a common coastal feature of the ‘warm’ temperate zone extending from Shark Bay to Cape Leeuwin where coastal features are dominated by the softer Tamala limestone.

Mainland and island intertidal reefs of this region typically comprise a flat reef platform backed to landward side by an undercut cliff (Figure 1), while isolated patch reefs typically comprise only the reef flat. The platform width varies markedly; those at Rottnest Island commonly exceed 50 m in width and are typically wider than those on the adjacent mainland. The reef platforms vary in structure from being relatively level to very irregular due to the presence of gutters and rock-pools, and their elevation in relation to tide datum may vary considerably. The seaward platform edge is frequently raised into a distinct rim beneath which the reef falls away in a vertical or undercut face to the seabed below.

3\. Intertidal reefs of the Marmion and Shoalwater Islands Marine Parks

The Marmion Marine Park (MMP) and Shoalwater Islands Marine Park (SIMP) are located on the north and south Perth metropolitan coast, respectively. Covering coastal waters between Burns Beach and Trigg Island, the ca 9,500 ha MMP was created in 1987, while the ca 6,658 ha SIMP was created in 1990 over coastal waters from South Channel to Becher Point (CALM 1992, DEC 2007). Sanctuary zones were, however, only established in the SIMP as recently as 2007. The MMP and SIMP comprise a similar geomorphology dominated by sub-tidal and emergent limestone reefs and shallow sandy embayments (Searle & Semenuik 1985). Both marine parks support a diverse range of marine conservation values ranging from various marine habitats to threatened marine fauna. These marine parks are subject to high levels of recreational and commercial human activity due to their proximity to the Perth metropolitan area. Occurring along mainland and island shores and as isolated offshore patch reefs, significant areas of intertidal reef platform occur in both the MMP and SIMP.

Intertidal reef organisms of the Perth region have been studied since the early 1950s (Smith 1952, Marsh 1955, Hodgkin 1959b, Hodgkin et al. 1959). Since that time, most local research in this field has been concentrated at Rottnest Island, which supports large areas of intertidal reef (see Black & Johnson 1983, Wells et al. 1993a, 1993b). Studies in the 1980s on the intertidal reef fauna of the Perth metropolitan mainland derived from concern regarding exploitation of H. roei and planning for the then proposed Marmion Marine Park (Wells et al. 1987). A recent re-examination of intertidal reef invertebrates at Cottesloe, Waterman and Trigg on the northern Perth metropolitan coast concluded that no major changes in these communities had occurred since the 1980s (Wells et al. 2007). This study however, examined only three mainland reef sites, of which, two (Trigg and Waterman) were located within the MMP.

Management of intertidal reefs in the Perth region has increased significantly in recent decades through the creation of marine parks and reserves and enhanced fishery controls (CALM 1992, Hancock & Caputi 2006, DEC 2007). While the above studies provide a significant regional knowledge base, the broad spatial patterns of intertidal biodiversity across both the MMP and SIMP are not adequately understood. Particular gaps exist in knowledge of the intertidal communities of the SIMP and offshore platform reefs. This project will significantly expand on the knowledge generated by Wells et al. (1987, 2007) by increasing the number of sampling sites across both the MMP and SIMP and including offshore platform reefs. This study will determine relationships between the composition of these communities and the physical structure and location of the reefs. This study will focus on assemblages of algae, echinoderms, molluscs and barnacles, as these include major primary producers (ie algae), grazers (ie echinoderms and molluscs) and predators (ie molluscs) in these habitats. It is anticipated that this study will provide a basis for the design and implementation of comparative intertidal research in marine parks and reserves across WA.  
  


 

_4\. Management relevance_

 

This study will provide knowledge of how intertidal reef communities in the MMP and SIMP are structured in space and time. Such ‘inventory’ and/or ‘baseline’ information is required to determine the composition of these ecological values in relation to natural processes, and to benchmark their condition with regard to the impact of current and future anthropogenic impacts (Simpson 2007).

 

This study will address the following management questions:

 

·         What are the patterns of intertidal biodiversity in the MMP and SIMP?

 

·         Do areas of particularly high intertidal biodiversity exist, and where are they located?

 

·         What natural and/or anthropogenic factors best explain the patterns of intertidal biodiversity in the MMP and SIMP?

 

·         Do the current sanctuary zones provide adequate and representative protection for these communities?

 

·         How should these communities be monitored?

<p>Intertidal reef community studies in the same region as the proposed study have used sampling quadrats of 0.25 and 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> (Wells et al. 2007, R. Black pers com.). Wells et al. (2007) found that ten replicate 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats sampled 67% and 76% of the echinoderms and molluscs, respectively, recorded in 32 quadrats at a mainland platform reef at Cottesloe, which lies between the SIMP and MMP. Long-term intertidal reef studies at Rottnest Island have used larger quadrats (1.0 m<sup>2</sup>) due to the low densities of most organisms (R. Black pers com.).</p>
<p>Preliminary sampling has been carried out to establish the most appropriate sampling units and level of replication for this study (Kingsford &amp; Battershill 1998). Preliminary data derived from using 0.25 and 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats were subject to precision analysis to determine the most appropriate sampling unit and the optimal number of replicate samples required for the broader study. Precision (p) is high when the standard error is small relative to the mean (ie p=SE/mean) and the optimal sample size (n) may be derived for a given level of precision by n=[s/p(mean)]<sup>2</sup>, where s=standard deviation (Andrew &amp; Mapstone 1987).</p>
<p>Results of the precision analysis suggest that 9 and 15 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats per site would provide a high level of precision for species richness and abundance, respectively. In contrast, a minimum of 2 and 7 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> quadrats were required to achieve the same level of precision for species richness and abundance, respectively. Given the expected fine-scale patchiness and low densities of some taxa in these habitats, the 1.0 m<sup>2</sup> quadrat will be used as the sampling unit in this study. To provide an adequate level of spatial coverage a total of 10 replicates will be collected in each tidal zone on each reef.</p>
<p>Sampling design</p>
<p>This study is a broad-scale, descriptive biological survey with a stratified, systematic design. The strata are: (i) marine reserve or proposed marine reserve (MMP, SIMP &amp; proposed SIMP extension); (ii) reefs adjacent to shoreline and isolated patch reefs; and (iii) tidal zones on reefs. The design is unbalanced as not all strata can be consistently replicated. Five shoreline and offshore survey points have been selected in each of the MMP and SIMP, and these sites have been selected to systematically cover the geographic extent of intertidal reef habitat in each reserve. Offshore sites are not represented in the proposed SIMP extension, and a limited number of appropriate shoreline sites are available. The survey design is presented in Fig 2, and the sampling locations are presented in Appendix II.</p>

<p>At each sampling site, transects will be placed parallel to the coast in each of the distinctive reef ‘zones’ identified by Wells et al. (2007) (ie the low energy inshore zone, the high energy outer ‘bare’ zone and the middle zone typically dominated by Sargassum or Ecklonia) and quadrats will be sampled along the transect. In each quadrat, the percent cover of algal functional groups (see Bellchambers et al. 2009) will be recorded and the total numbers of each echinoderm, mollusc and barnacle species of &gt;5 mm in length will be counted. The presence of recruits will also be recorded. The number of each species in each quadrat will then be expressed as an abundance m<sup>-2</sup> for each tidal zone on each reef. Sampling will be conducted during summer months during three consecutive years (2010, 2011 &amp; 2012) to assess the temporal stability of the intertidal reef communities.</p>
<p>Sampling transects will not be permanently marked. The position of each transect will be recorded using GPS and, given the typically small size of the reefs, sampling in consecutive years will occur close to the initial positions.</p>
<p>A range of physical and human use variables will also be measured or estimated in relation to each reef sampling site. These will include the platform location, size, relative exposure and wave energy, relative height in relation to tide datum, and rugosity. Human use data will be derived from MMP and SIMP visitor data and other sources.</p>
<p>Data analyses</p>
<p>Broad spatial and temporal patterns in the composition of intertidal reef communities will be analysed using multivariate analyses (mainly non-metric multidimensional scaling, permutational ANOVA, SIMPER within the PRIMER and PERMANOVA+ software).</p>

691,"Pilbara Biological Survey
"," 

The Western Australian Department of Water (DoW) is investigating options for developing additional groundwater resources in the Pilbara, including a number of aquifers associated with major rivers on the Roebourne Plains (State Water Plan, Government of Western Australia 2007). A number of aquifers have been selected for detailed investigation and assessment to be completed as part of DoW’s Pilbara Water Smart Australia project. These include alluvial aquifers associated with the Fortescue, Yule and De Grey rivers. Investigations will include hydrogeological assessment, estimation of ecological water requirements and determination of allocation limits for these resources. Ultimately this information will be summarised as statutory water resource management plans due for completion in 2011. As a contribution to this process, the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) was contracted to undertake an investigation into the relationships between river pool aquatic invertebrates and habitat variables that may be affected by groundwater drawdown associated with water extraction.

 

Many river pools in lowland reaches of Pilbara Rivers are maintained by groundwater inflows from alluvial aquifers during the dry season, so are groundwater dependant ecosystems. Lowering groundwater tables could reduce the longevity of such pools during the dry season and affect water quality, the latter especially where declining water availability concentrates the impacts of cattle.

 

There is a growing body of knowledge on the ecology and ecological water requirements of aquatic invertebrates in dryland rivers, with much of this work having been done in Australia, especially in the Lake Eyre and Murray Darling basins (e.g. Boulton and Jenkins, 1998; Boulton and Hancock, 2006; Boulton et al., 2006; Costelloe et al., 2004 and Sheldon et al., 2002). From this work it is evident that aquatic invertebrate communities are strongly affected by various aspects of riverine hydrological regimes, including the extent, timing, frequency, reliability and duration of both floods and droughts. Not all of this work will be directly applicable to determining ecological water requirements in the Pilbara, for two reasons. Firstly, the work undertaken to date has focused on the effects of reduced flows, primarily in relation to floodplain ecology. In the Pilbara, proposed groundwater resource developments will not affect river flows and off channel flooding, which arise as a result of rains further inland, but they could affect water levels in pools once flows cease. Effects of drought on pool communities in dryland regions are poorly understood, especially in terms of ecological water requirements (Lake 2003, Boulton 2003). Secondly, eastern Australian river systems are very different in nature to those in the Pilbara in that they have comparatively subdued topography, more braided channels, extensive floodplains with large numbers of off-channel wetlands, less predictable hydrological regimes and are mostly not maintained by fresh groundwater once flows cease (see above references). These differences mean that studies particular to the Pilbara will be needed to determine ecological water requirements of wetlands potentially affected by groundwater drawdown.

 

The most comprehensive study of Pilbara wetlands to date has been the Pilbara Biological Survey. Aquatic invertebrates were included in that survey (Pinder et al., in review.) but too few lowland pools were sampled in that project to provide the sort of information needed by DoW. There has been some work undertaken to determine river pool ecological water requirements on the lower De Grey River (van Dam et al. 2005), but this was just one river, invertebrate identifications were to family level only and sampling intensity did not match the large Pilbara Biological Survey dataset, making it difficult to assess relative conservation values.

 

The project described here is not intended to develop specific ecological water requirement models for potential groundwater development projects. Such an objective would require a much larger and longer project. Instead, given fixed funding and time constraints, the project will investigate the relative conservation values of lowland river pools for aquatic invertebrates in the three rivers of interest and describe patterns in their distribution in relation to river pool habitat variables that may be affected by reduced groundwater levels.

 
","<ul>
<li>To provide an improved understanding of the relative ecological values and significance of pools within proposed groundwater extraction areas, in relation to other wetlands in the catchment and the region.</li>
<li>To investigate relationships between river pool invertebrate faunas and pool size, permanence and the type and diversity of functional habitats.</li>
<li>To provide advice, based on the above, which will contribute to an assessment of the ecological water requirements of Pilbara river pools.</li>
</ul>","<p>The project will determine whether lowland river pools in the Pilbara have conservation values that are not replicated elsewhere (either in lowland areas of other catchments or in other areas of the Pilbara) and that therefore require particular attention when planning for development of new groundwater resources.</p>
<p>The project will also provide knowledge of relationships between invertebrate faunas of lowland river pools in the Pilbara and environmental variables, such as pool size, depth and permanence, potentially affected by extraction of groundwater in adjacent alluvial aquifers.</p>
<p>Both types of knowledge will assist DoW to make decisions about which of the region’s aquifers to develop and how to manage these to minimise consequences for riverine communities. This information will also benefit staff within DEC that will be required to assess the environmental impacts of groundwater resource development in the Pilbara.</p>","<p>In the short term, the Department of Water in WA and the Federal government will be the primary users of this data. DoW will be provided with a report on the research and be provided with all of the data. More broadly, researchers and managers working on wetlands in the Pilbara will benefit from having additional data on the relative conservation values and condition of lowland river pools.</p>","<p>Field work completed - end of October 2008</p>

<p><strong>Field work:</strong></p>
<p>Pools will be sampled in spring as this is when they are most likely to be under water stress.</p>
<p>Invertebrate sampling: Aquatic macroinvertebrates will be sampled at ten of the river pools (3 to 4 per river). Three 15 metre sweep net samples will be collected at each pool: one in each of the most extensive habitats present in each pool. This is equivalent to the benthic invertebrate sampling effort used in the Pilbara Biological Survey and other projects in DEC. These samples will be sorted in the laboratory and invertebrates identified to species level where possible, using the same taxonomy as used for the Pilbara Biological Survey. Microinvertebrates (rotifers, protozoans and microcrustacea) will not be identified as they are too time consuming.</p>
<p>For the remaining ten river pools only chemical and physical variables will be collected or measured, with the aim of using these as surrogates for likely invertebrate richness and composition. </p>
<p>Water chemistry and habitat descriptions: Conductivity, water temperature, pH and turbidity will be measured in the field. Water samples will be collected for analysis of total dissolved solids, alkalinity, ionic composition, nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll. Depth will be measured at each sampling location. Cover of macrophytes will be estimated for each sampling location and samples of macrophytes will be taken using fixed area quadrats for measurement of dry weight macrophyte biomass. Percent areal cover of three sediment size fractions will be estimated in the field (bedrock+boulder, pebble+cobble and fine sediment - clay to gravel) and a two litre sample of the latter will be collected for particle size composition analysis in the lab.

<p>DoW will provide data on pool permanence and size using Landsat TM imagery for six epochs between 2000 and 2006. These epochs will be selected so that they allow maximum time for pools to dry between floods. The proportion of epochs for which water cannot be detected will represent a ‘permanence’ measure for each pool. Where water is present this will be used to determine a minimum and maximum area of inundation during the same epochs.</p>
<p><strong>Data analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Comparison of richness and composition of invertebrate faunas between pools and catchments and comparison with river pools sampled for the Pilbara Biological Survey, using species lists and multivariate analyses (cluster analyses and MDS ordination).</li>
<li>Identification of faunal elements for which lowland pools are particularly important within the region.</li>
<li>Analysis of univariate relationships between richness of invertebrates and chemical, physical and remotely sensed hydrological habitat variables, both at the level of the sample and pool. Environmental variables will also be converted to ordinal scores, based on percentiles, for analysis of variance.</li>
<li>The remotely sensed hydrological variables will also be available for some of the Pilbara Biological Survey river pools, so similar analyses will be undertaken using PBS data.</li>
<li>Distance-based linear modeling and constrained ordinations will be used to examine the relationships between physical, chemical and hydrological variables and aquatic invertebrate community composition.</li>
<li>The above analyses will be used to examine the influence of hydrological regimes (depth, pool size, permanency) in comparison to other habitat variables and, where hydrology is found to be important, those relationships will be quantified and examined for thresholds of change.</li>
<li>The invertebrate data from this project will be used to test the ability of multivariate adaptive regression spline models (MARS) built for the Pilbara Biological Survey to predict invertebrate richness in lowland river pools.

701,"SCP 2007/009 – Taxonomic resolution and description of new plant species in Western Australia
","The triggerplant genus Stylidium Sw. (Stylidiaceae) is renowned for its unique pollination mechanism in which pollen is transferred via a touch-sensitive floral column. With almost 300 known taxa, it is one of the most abundant and diversified genera in Australia. Approximately 70% of species are endemic in south-west W.A., with a secondary area of diversity in the tropical monsoon biome (which includes the Kimberley region) and relatively few species across the remainder of the continent. There are eight species in south-east Asia and one in New Zealand.

Substantial progress has been made over the past 20 years in documenting Australia’s Stylidium diversity. Some 87 taxa have been formally described during that period: 60 from south-west W.A. (Carlquist & Lowrie 1989; Lowrie & Carlquist 1991; Kenneally 1992; Lowrie & Kenneally 1994a, 1997a & c, 1998a-b, 2000, 2004; Lowrie et al. 1998, 1999; Wege 2005, 2006a–f, 2007a, 2008; Wege & Coates 2007; Wege et al. 2007); 25 from northern Australia (Bean 1999a-b, 2000; Lowrie & Kenneally 1994b, 1996, 1997b, 1998b, 1999); and two from south-eastern Australia (Jackson & Wiltshire 2001; Raulings & Ladiges 2001). Furthermore, a number of taxa have been reinstated or redefined following examination of type material (e.g. Bean 1999b, 2000; Jackson & Wiltshire 2001; Lowrie et al. 1999; Raulings & Ladiges 2001; Wege 2006b & d, 2007a). 

In W.A., this research effort, combined with an intensive period of floristic survey and inventory, has resulted in the State’s herbarium collections more than doubling in size to c. 11, 000 accessions. Over the past six years, a significant amount of time has been allocated to sorting sections of this collection, resulting in the discovery of 40 new taxa (Wege 2005, 2006a, c & e-f, 2007a, 2008; Wege et al. 2007; Western Australian Herbarium 1998–) and a considerable improvement in our understanding of the distribution and rarity of many taxa.

Despite this productive phase of taxonomic research, knowledge of Stylidium remains insufficient for scientific and conservation needs. There are more than 30 taxa, mostly from W.A., that require formal description (Bostock & Holland 2007; Western Australian Herbarium 2008–), and numerous species complexes remain poorly understood. Furthermore, there is no comprehensive checklist and synonymy and there are a number of nomenclature and typification issues that require resolution. Progress continues to be made in this respect (e.g. Bean 1999b, 2000; Wege 2006b&d, 2007a&b, 2009).

Perhaps the most significant issue at this point in time, particularly in south-west W.A., is the lack of readily accessible diagnostic information for end-users of the existing taxonomy. Whilst there are identification guides to the species of northern Australia (Bean 1999b, 2000), there is no up-to-date key to the triggerplants of southern Australia. This makes accurate identification by conservation personnel, botanical consultants and other stakeholders highly problematic and presents a major impediment to survey and conservation assessments. This is especially concerning in southern W.A., where more than 70 taxa are listed as Declared Rare or Priority Flora, the majority of which require further survey to understand the full extent of their distribution.

To date, phylogenetic research has focused on generic relationships within Stylidiaceae rather than relationships within Stylidium (Laurent et al. 1998; Wagstaff & Wege 2002). With its high species diversity, spectacular floral variation, unique and precise pollination system (Armbruster et al. 1994), and chromosome number diversity (James 1979), Stylidium is an excellent study system for investigating a broad array of evolutionary questions. The recent improvements in our taxonomic understanding of the genus will provide the necessary platform for such studies.
","<p>The primary aim of this SPP is to improve the underlying taxonomic knowledge necessary for effective biodiversity management of the triggerplant genus Stylidium and to make this information readily accessible to stakeholders. This will be achieved through: </p>
<p>·    the resolution of the taxonomy, nomenclature and conservation status of each taxon; and</p>
<p>·    the creation of an electronic key and fact sheets for the known species.</p>
<p>A secondary, longer-term aim will be to investigate phylogenetic relationships within Stylidium with a view to providing new insights into the evolutionary history of the genus and the south-west flora as a whole, as well as an evolutionary context for conservation management.</p>","<p>This SPP directly addresses the central purpose and role of the DEC Science Division: to provide up-to-date and scientifically sound information to uphold effective, evidence-based conservation of biodiversity and sustainable natural resource management in Western Australia.

Herbarium specimens will be critically examined and, where possible, their identification confirmed or corrected. Field work will be conducted, enabling critical morphological and ecological data to be gathered and taxonomic boundaries to be assessed. This field component is essential since highly diagnostic features of the flowers (e.g. the colour, shape and orientation of the corolla lobes, morphology of throat appendages) are usually obscured on pressed material. Pressed herbarium vouchers and flowers stored in 70% ethanol will be collected and lodged at the Western Australian Herbarium and other relevant State herbaria. Photographs of fresh plant material will aid the taxonomic process and will assist the end-users of the proposed taxonomy.</p>
<p>Herbarium collections will be re-examined in light of information gathered in the field and taxonomic hypotheses refined.

<p>Interactive key and fact sheets. Stylidium exhibits considerable variation in vegetative and floral morphology and lends itself to an interactive identification approach. The key will be created using Lucid and will initially be based on a reduced character list of c. 50 key diagnostic characters which will be scored for all taxa (c. 230) from southern Australia. Data will be compiled from herbarium specimens, relevant literature, field observations and existing data sets. Intractable species complexes will be left as such and highlighted as needing further research.</p>
<p>Taxon fact sheets will be created using Fact Sheet Fusion and will include: a brief description and list of diagnostic features; flowering time; distribution, habitat and conservation information; synonyms; and a list of species the taxon is most likely to be confused with. Field photographs, a scan of a pressed specimen (to show habit, leaf morphology and inflorescence structure) and/or illustrations will be prepared for electronic publication. Photographs will be sought for species not adequately represented in photographic collections.</p>
<p>Dissemination of information. Taxonomic revisions, including the formal description of new species, will be written and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The results of this research will be further promoted through conference presentations, lectures, popular articles and/or media releases. A Stylidium identification workshop for stakeholders will be run at the PERTH herbarium and potentially also at regional centres.

Past records have shown that two days with temperatures over 40ºC and high winds was associated with rapid extension of Botryosphaeria sp. lesions in Banksia speciosa leading to the death of affected trees near Hopetoun (Shearer 1994). Since 1994 there has been a steady increase in canker reports and samples received for identification particularly in the declared rare flora Banksia verticillata, B.brownii as well as non threatened taxa such as B. baxteri, B. coccinea, and B. sessilis. South Coast Regional staff have expressed concern that many of the natural populations of B. anatona, B. verticillata and Lambertia orbifolia spp. orbifolia (including a translocated population) DRF appear to be succumbing to canker by degrees. Families outside the Proteaceae are also impacted, eg. Acacia accuminatus and Calothamnus quadrifidus are also recorded as having high rates of branch and stem cankers (Pathogen of the month 2007, DEC records).

Observation and increase in sample numbers suggests that the incidence and severity of these events is increasing which indicates a shift in the host/pathogen/environment disease triangle has occurred. As the hosts are endemic and the pathogens also appear endemic this leaves environmental change as the likely reason for the change in impact. Quantification of canker incidence and severity requires semi permanent transects to be established and monitored across the region and compared simultaneously with climatic data.

Direct therapy for the affected hosts is one management option available within a holistic disease management strategy. As Denman (2004) has been able to show reduced canker activity with application of several fungicides in Protea magnifica in the field it is quite likely that these fungicides will be capable of reducing impact of cankers in affected species particularly B. verticillata and L. orbifolia in the South Coast of Western Australia.

708,"Gorgon Dredge Plume Program WAMMP Finfish Monitoring Program (in development) 
","Assessing the status and trends in the condition of biodiversity assets assists DEC to fulfill its statutory responsibilities for the conservation of the State’s biodiversity. The systematic long-term monitoring, evaluation and reporting (MER) of asset condition-pressure-response (CPR) is a key strategy for assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of management action within Western Australia’s system of marine protected areas (MPAs). MER programs also determined whether conservation goals (i.e. outcomes) are being achieved. Marine management strategies include the use of zoning schemes and regulations to control human activities, compliance monitoring, public participation and community education programs and direct management intervention.  The early detection of ecosystem change through strategic MER programs allows for the modification of these management practices to changing ecosystem condition and threats within an adaptive management context.  

 

The Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP) was established in 2008 within DEC’s Marine Science Program to coordinate the MER of marine biodiversity asset (e.g. finfish, seagrass, and coral communities etc.) CPR status and trends within Western Australia’s MPAs.  A key biodiversity asset of WA MPAs is finfish. Finfish are listed as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) within most WA MPAs, highlighting their biodiversity significance, social and economic value. Finfish in most MPAs are under considerable anthropogenic pressure from recreational and, to a lesser extent, commercial fishing activities.

 

In shallow, coastal waters, the condition of fish communities has traditionally been monitored, using a technique known as Underwater Visual Census (UVC; Ayling and Ayling 1987; Connell et al. 1998; Samoilys and Carlos 2000; Layman et al. 2004; Williamson et al. 2004; Hobbs et al. 2008).  More recently, a technique for assessing finfish community condition has been developed that utilises stereo-video to capture imagery of fish communities which is later analysed in the laboratory (Watson et al. 2005, 2010; Shedrawi 2008; McLaren 2009; Langlois et al. 2010).  Known as Diver Operated Video (DOV), this technique has potential advantages over UVC because sampling theoretically requires less scientific expertise, takes less time in the field and data analysts have access to reference material to help identify fish,. In addition, it provides a permanent record of the survey that can be checked or revisited at a later point if required. However, DOV datasets are significantly more costly to process and it is unclear if video imagery captures the same level of diversity and abundance as skilled divers conducting UVC. 

 

Despite the significant amount of DOV surveys that have been completed in fish communities in WA over recent years, no thorough investigation comparing the overall utility, results and cost-effectiveness of this technique to conventional UVC methods has been conducted. As such, comparable assessments need to be undertaken to assess the relative utility of these techniques in both temperate and tropical waters where WAMMP has monitoring responsibilities and to better understand the value of historical UVC and DOV datasets. This is especially relevant given the staff constraints (outlined above) and the significant financial and time constraints placed on activities conducted by WAMMP.
","<p>This project aims to compare the accuracy, comparability, cost-efficiency and appropriateness of UVC and DOV survey techniques as methods for assessing fish community condition in low diversity temperate (i.e. Jurien Bay Marine Park), near-shore high diversity tropical (i.e. Montebello/Barrow Islands MPA’s) and off-shore high diversity tropical (i.e. Rowley Shoals Marine Park) marine ecosystems in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The primary objectives are: </p>
<p>i)     Examine the comparability of the fish community dataset (diversity, abundance and size measures) resulting from collection through UVC and DOV survey techniques.</p>
<p>ii)    Examine the effect of varying levels of diversity and abundance on the resulting fish community datasets when data is collected through the two techniques.</p>
<p>iii)    Examine the effect of habitat complexity related to tropical and temperate marine ecosystems on the resulting fish datasets when data is collected through the two techniques.</p>
<p>iv)    Assess the relative cost and practicality of both UVC and DOV techniques in the context of long-term monitoring programs in both tropical and temperate remote locations.</p>
<p>The secondary objectives are:</p>
<p>vi)    Contribution of fish community condition data at long-term monitoring sites towards WAMMP annual audit and monitoring objectives.</p>
<p>vii)   Contribution of fish community condition data at long-term monitoring sites towards the Gorgon Dredge Monitoring Project.</p>
<p>viii)  Continue to offer fish community monitoring training and build effective working arrangements with DEC staff in the Kimberley, Pilbara and Mid-West regions.</p>","<p>The outcomes of this project are:</p>
<p>i)     An improved understanding of the comparability of UVC and DOV methods for measuring diversity, abundance and size information of finfish communities.  This will facilitate better alignment of historical UVC data with existing DOV data and vice-versa and allow DEC to better assess the utility of historical time-series of fish community information for use in WAMMP.  These datasets would be confounded without such a study.</p>
<p>ii)    An improved understanding of the applicability to regional staff and relative costs of each survey technique as a monitoring tool for fish communities in tropical and temperate marine ecosystems.  This will allow WAMMP to more effectively select between the two survey techniques.</p>
<p>iii)    Acquisition of further data on the status of finfish communities within JBMP, MBIMP and RSMP.</p>
<p>The program addresses the following strategic objectives:</p>
<p>i)     DEC Corporate Plan (2007-2009): 1.2, 1.4;</p>
<p>ii)    A Strategic Plan for Biodiversity Conservation Research (2008-2017): 1.18, 1.21, 3.1, 3.7, 3.8; and</p>
<p>iii)   Montebello/Barrow Islands Marine Conservation Reserves management plan: 9.1.13; Jurien Bay Marine Park management plan: 7.1.12; Rowley Shoals Marine Park management plan:  9.1.6</p>","<p>Although the knowledge acquired through this project will be of great use to DEC’s marine monitoring program, it is anticipated that it will also be of significant relevance to the wider scientific community both nationally and internationally. Research findings will be transferred within DEC through a technical report compiled at the completion of the project, and through direct feedback and presentations to relevant in-house scientists, managers and Marine Park Coordinators. This will allow the findings to be integrated into the future directions of the WAMMP finfish monitoring program. The outcomes will be communicated to the wider scientific community through the publication of the results in a peer-reviewed marine science journal, and their presentation at relevant scientific conferences and forums, allowing the findings to be taken up by researchers and monitoring programs in other locations. Although the direct nature of the project is somewhat technical, the outcomes will allow for more appropriate comparisons between current and historical datasets, which will in turn be communicated to the public through popular articles, local media releases and public lectures.</p>","<p>Milestone</p>

<p>Field work for the project will be conducted at three separate locations: Rowley Shoals Marine Park, Montebello/ Barrow Islands marine conservation reserves, and Jurien Bay Marine Park.  These locations were chosen as they represent three distinctly different marine ecosystems that are typical of Western Australia’s waters, and are currently or likely to be the focus of fish monitoring programs in the near future.  The exact manner in which UVC surveys are carried out can vary slightly between researchers.  As such, it is seen as advantageous to utilize the expertise of those researchers who have experience doing surveys in each location so as to maximize the strength of the comparison with historical datasets.</p>
<p>- Rowley Shoals</p>
<p>The Rowley Shoals are located approximately 300km west of Broom, northern Western Australia.  This location represents a typical oceanic tropical coral reef ecosystem.  The reef system is comprised of 3 separate reef atolls that rise from depth at the edge of the Australian continental shelf.  Historical datasets indicate that fish species diversity, habitat complexity and water visibility/clarity are high (Allen 1983; AIMS 2007).  Surveys at this location will be run in collaboration with Mr. Mike Travers from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS).  AIMS have been historically responsible for a majority of the fish surveys at the Rowley Shoals using conventional UVC techniques, with Mr. Travers having completed these over the past 3 years.  Surveys will be conducted primarily at AIMS Long Term Monitoring Sites, on the eastern outer slope of each of the shoals.  Three sites are located on each shoal, for a total of 9 all up.</p>

<p>- Montebello / Barrow Islands</p>
<p>The Montebello and Barrow Islands represent a typical in-shore tropical coral reef ecosystem.  They are located approximately 120km west of Dampier, northern Western Australia.  The island chain consists of a complicated series of low lying rocky islands and coral reef platforms, ranging from highly exposed outer reef, to a more typical sheltered inshore reef system.  Previous research indicates that fish species diversity is high (Allen 2000), habitat complexity is variable, and water visibility/clarity is generally low (personal observations).  Surveys at this location will be run by DEC Marine Science staff (Dr. Richard Evans, Dr. Tom Holmes, Mr. George Shedrawi).  To date, fully quantitative assessments of fish communities at the Montebello Islands using UVC techniques have been rare.  Surveys will be conducted at existing GMER monitoring sites located throughout the Montebello and Barrow Island region.  Specific sites will be chosen on the trip, to allow for variable weather, current and visibility patterns.  Eighteen sites will be surveyed in total.</p>

<p>Jurien Bay is located on the Western Australian coast, approximately 200km north-west of Perth.  This location represents a typical near-shore temperate reef ecosystem for Western Australian waters.  Fish diversity in the region is mid to low (Hutchins 1994), with habitat largely consisting of low relief limestone platform reef.  Surveys at this location will be run in collaboration with Dr. Neville Barrett from the University of Tasmania.  In collaboration with Dr. Graham Edgar, Dr. Barrett has been running fish surveys at Jurien Bay on a yearly basis for the past 12 years.  Surveys will be conducted at existing UTAS Long Term Monitoring Sites throughout Jurien Bay.  Out of the 42 potential sites, 18 will be surveyed with site selection depending on weather and currents while in the field.</p>

<p>Fish Assemblage (diversity, abundance and biomass) Comparison</p>
<p>- Surveys</p>
<p>UVC and DOV surveys will be conducted on five replicate 5 metre x 50 metre belt transects at each of the locations.  Both survey methods will be conducted simultaneously along each of the transects to avoid any variability that may arise as a result of varying sampling times.  Briefly, 3 divers will enter the water at the start of each transect.  One diver will control the DOV unit, one will conduct the UVC, and the other will lay the transect tape and control distance.  The DOV and UVC divers will assemble at the beginning of the transect, and swim along it side by side, at a speed of approximately 8mins/50metres.  The UVC diver will record all large fishes (e.g. Serranids, Lutjanids, Lethrinids, Scarids) within the 5 metre belt, whilst the DOV diver will swim directly beside with the DOV pointed directly ahead.  The UVC will additionally record the size of all Serranids, Lutjanids and Lethrinids (additional fish groups may be added at a later point) recorded along the transects.  The third diver will follow immediately behind, laying the transect tape as they go.  At the end of the 50 metres, the tape diver will tug the fins of the UVC and DOV divers, indicating that they finish the transect.  10 metres distance will be swum, before the next transect begins and the process is repeated.  At the end of the fifth transect, the DOV diver will finish the videos.  The UVC diver will turn and swim back along each of the transects counting the smaller, more site associated species (e.g. Pomacentrids).  The DOV diver and the tape diver will follow behind, winding the tapes (five 50 metre tapes) up as they go.</p>
<p>The depth of the sites will vary but will generally be between 5 and 12 metres.  All individual transects will however follow a specific depth contour from start to finish.  The DOV unit will be operated following the Marine Science Program Standard Operating Procedures, with the unit being swum approximately 0.8m above the substrate, on a slight downward facing angle.</p>
<p>- Video Imagery Analysis</p>
<p>Video imagery collected using the DOV methods will be analysed using the computer software programs EventMeasure<sup>©</sup> and PhotoMeasure<sup>© </sup>(<a href=""http://www.seagis.com/"">www.seagis.com</a>). Analysis will be conducted in the computer laboratory by trained technicians who are adept and experienced at both the software and fish identification.  The abundance of all fish and the size of the same fish groups measured using the UVC method that are observed on the video footage will be recorded.</p>
<p>- Statistical Analysis      </p>
<p>A combination of multivariate (e.g. MDS, CAP Analysis, PERMANOVA) and univariate (e.g. paired T-tests, repeated measures ANOVA) will be used to examine both community level and individual level relationships in the data respectively.  Differences in the size structures between the data sets will be examined using chi-squared tests  This data will explore differences between both methods and locations.  Although time restrictions at the Rowley Shoals mean that the design will be slightly unbalanced, this will be accounted for in the statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Time and Cost Comparison</p>
<p>All time and costs spent on each of the monitoring techniques at each location will be recorded and tallied.  For UVC surveys, these time and financial costs will include, but not be restricted to:</p>
<p>-       staff mobilisation, sampling equipment (i.e. data sheets, slates, tapes, etc.) purchase and preparation</p>
<p>-       staff travel, accommodation, field expenses</p>
<p>-       in-water surveys</p>
<p>-       in-field equipment preparation and maintenance</p>
<p>-       data collation/cleanup</p>
<p>-       data post-processing (i.e. entering into computer spreadsheet)</p>
<p>-       review of reference material for re-familiarisation with fish fauna</p>
<p>-       data archiving</p>
<p>-       post-trip maintenance/cleanup</p>
<p>For DOV surveys, the time and financial costs will include, but not be restricted to:</p>

","The flora of Western Australia is still inadequately known (Gibson, Coates & Thiele, 2007, Nuytsia 17: 1-12). The state is under-explored botanically, and the existing herbarium collections are insufficiently studied. New taxa that are readily recognised as such are still being discovered, for example in _Wurmbea_ where a revision and summary Flora of Australia treatment were published in the past (Macfarlane 1980, 1987) and it might have been expected that only a few additional species might be found. However in South Australia Bates () described xx new species and subspecies as a result of extensive field observations over a number of years, and in Western Australia a similar pattern has been occurring. Whilst few new taxa have turned up in the relatively well-studied south west within the forest and agricultural regions, a remarkable 20 or so new species have been discovered or separated from existing ones through a number of years of field work at appropriate seasons in the pastoral, goldfields and desert areas. Other new species are often detected in the exisiting herbarium collections as plant groups are critically studied taxonomically, some recent examples being Williams (2007) in _Puccinellia,_ Hislop (2009) in _Leucopogon_ and Rye (2009) in _Oxymyrrhine,_ or as a result of geographically-based surveys, e.g. Keighery (2008) in Lomandra, Shepherd & Lyons (2009) and Macfarlane et al. (2010) in several genera. There are many more taxa where existing variation is not properly catered for by available identification keys, so that users are unable to satisfactorily assign a significant proportion of specimens. Identification keys are not available or are outdated or inadequate for many plant groups with much reliance still placed on the now variously aged parts of Blackall & Grieve (Blackall & Grieve 1954 to Grieve 1998) so that identifying specimens from, for example, environmental surveys, is more laborious and uncertain than it should be. Conservation of the flora is held back by these difficulties because taxa need to be defined with reasonable certainty to justify the resources needed for specific protective measures, and they need to be identifiable by regional staff and they need to be formally named according to standard scientific procedures. Whilst there are new conventional keys for some groups (e.g. Wheeler 2004, Rye 2009), interactive keys for others (Sharp & Simon , Rye et al. in prep.), and plans in process for integrated identification systems in FloraBase,  there remains an ongoing need for the basic research that will provide the authoritative and accurate taxon concepts and character information to put into those keying systems and in turn to service the users.
","<p>To study taxonomically genera or individual species groups or putative un-named taxa in selected plant families and investigate the question of whether the existing taxonomy is adequate or needs changes or improvements through revision of the classification and species limits, publishing new or revised descriptions of species, provision of new or up-dated identification keys, and contribute as relevant to the broader scientific dialogue.</p>","<ul>

","At a meeting held on 18/12/2007 at Kings Park attended by Greg Woodman, Cathy Godden (Woodman Environmental Consulting), DEC research staff (David Coates, Kevin Thiele) and BGPA research staff (Kingsley Dixon, Siegy Krauss, Matt Barrett, Russell Barrett, Mark Wallace), the need to understand population genetic variation and structure in DRF _Acacia woodmaniorum _Maslin & Buscomb and _A. karina _Maslin & Buscomb was identified.  This understanding was deemed critical to identify potential impacts from proposed mining activities on genetic diversity within these species and subsequent impacts on population, and species, viability.  It was also considered important to understand the evolutionary relationships between these rare species and their more common close relatives and whether their rarity is associated with habitat specialisation or historical circumstances linked possibly to past climatic events. As a result Karara mining provided funding for the appropriate research.  . 

 

Acacia woodmaniorum is a recently described species (Maslin & Buscumb 2007) endemic to the Blue Hill Banded Ironstone Ranges of the Midwest region of south-west Western Australia.  The Blue Hills area occurs on the interface between the South West Botanical Province and the arid Eremaean Province.  The taxa is listed as Declared Rare Flora on DEC’s “Declared Rare and Priority Flora List” (Atkins 2006).  _Acacia woodmaniorum _is a member of _Acacia_ sect. Alatae (Benth.) Pedley thought to be most closely aligned to _A. alata_ R. Br., and in particular, to the most northerly distributed variety of that species, var. _biglandulosa _Benth. (Maslin & Buscumb 2007).  _Acacia woodmaniorum _was discovered in 1992 by Ray Cranfield, and the most significant collections of the species were made between 2004 and 2006 by staff from Woodman Environmental Consulting and DEC (Maslin & Buscumb 2007).  _Acacia woodmaniorum _is known from around 28,000 plants found in just three populations located on top of Mungada Ridge and Jasper Hill, over an area of about 40km^2^. All three populations occur in an area covered by mining exploration leases.

 

Understanding the distribution of genetic diversity and key processes that may influence that distribution are likely to be critical for assessing a range of possible management actions that will maximise the persistence of populations of _Acacia woodmaniorum _where genetic diversity may already be limited due to rarity.  The outcomes of this project are a detailed knowledge of the levels and distribution of genetic diversity and key processes such as the mating system and patterns of gene flow that may influence that distribution as well as confirmation of the putatively related taxa.  The project is innovative in using molecular genetic techniques to assess the impact of mining activities on species genetic diversity and infer the potential effects of reduced diversity on population persistence.  Results of the project will have significant regional impact at the local scale specifically for any mining and conservation activities undertaken across the species range.
","<p>Phase 1 addresses questions on levels and partitioning of population genetic variation and the evolutionary relationships and distinctness to closest relatives.  </p>
<p>Phase 2 addresses questions on key population processes, such as mating and dispersal that influence future levels and patterns of genetic variation.  </p>

<li>Aims to assess phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary distinctness of _A. woodmaniorum _to putatively related taxa using analysis of DNA sequence data and microsatellite variation where cross-species amplification is achievable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Phase 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aims to assess key population genetic processes such as mating systems, gene flow and pollination influencing future levels and patterns of genetic variation in <em>A. woodmaniorum</em>.</li>
</ol>","<p>The outcomes of this project will include </p>
<ol>
<li>A detailed knowledge of the level of genetic diversity present in A. woodmaniorum, the distribution of population genetic variation across the species spatial distribution and fine scale patterns of spatial structure within populations.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary distinctness of A. woodmaniorum to putatively related taxa.</li>
<li>Knowledge of the patterns of phylogeography of A. woodmaniorum and related taxa across the landscape.</li>
<li>Knowledge of key population genetic processes including the mating system (degree of correlated paternity, degree of outcrossing) and levels and patterns of gene flow and migration in A. woodmaniorum.</li>
</ol>
<p>This information will be used to inform the funding body Karara Mining Ltd on the possible impacts of various mining activities on the maintenance of genetic diversity in A. woodmaniorum and on appropriate seed sampling regimes when sourcing seed for restoration purposes.  The outcomes will have direct benefits for DEC in the conservation management of the species in situ, as it occurs on the DEC conservation reserve.  Knowledge provided by the project outcomes can be used to ensure the maintenance of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential in the species and also adds to the knowledge base of the evolutionary development of native taxa throughout the Midwest.</p>",<p>Anticipated users of the knowledge to be gained include KML and DEC. Technology transfer strategy includes the provision of six monthly progress reports to Karara Mining Limited with a final report at project completion.

<p>Phase 1.2 Phyllodes will be collected from five individuals in each accessible population of the putatively closest relative of A. woodmaniorum and DNA extracted as above.  The trnV-ndhC, trnQ-rps16, ndhF-trnL, trns-trnG, psbA-trnH, psbD-trnT and other regions will be tested for interspecific variation.  DNA will be sequenced at three noncoding chloroplast regions that show maximal variation.  Sequences will be manually edited using the Bioedit program and contiguous alignments constructed using the CAPContig program.  Sequences will then be aligned using the ClustalW program.  Phylogenetic trees will be obtained using both parsimony and Bayesian inference methods using programs such as PAUP, DNAsp and Phylip using appropriate models once determined.  Appropriate outgroup taxa will be used to root the trees. Phylogenetic structure will also be investigated using Spatial Analysis of Molecular Variance to identify groups of populations that are highly divergent yet geographically homogeneous.  Once the overall genetic structure has been described a range of standard measures of population differentiation, haplotype diversity and pairwise nucleotide diversity will be estimated for divergent lineages within each species.  </p>
<p>Phase 2.1 Seed will be collected from plants bearing pods in all populations in which individuals have been exhaustively sampled and from one population within the main range.  Seed will be raised in the glasshouse and DNA extracted from phyllodes once plants are sufficiently large using the methods above.  All individuals will be genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci and mating system parameters such as outcrossing rates, biparental inbreeding ,correlation of outcrossed paternity, and correlation of outcrossing (or correlation of selfing) among plants will be estimated using the computer program MLTR version 2.4.  Pollen dispersal patterns (gene flow) will be assessed for populations where seed was collected using maximum likelihood methods paternity assignment as implemented in CERVUS 2.0 and using the exclusion method as implemented in the NEWPAT software.  Patterns of pollen dispersal within and between plants will be evaluated by determining the distance between mother and pollen source for each of the progeny if paternity is assigned with confidence.  The degree of gene flow within and among populations will be determined and the impact of population isolation and size on mating system parameters and patterns of gene flow determined using basic statistical analysis.</p>",required,False,<p>5</p>,not required,False,not required,<p>Data is being maintained on a personal computer and archived on an external data storage device of which the data custodian is in charge. </p>,,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, OVertime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"

<p>SP 2016-068&nbsp;South West Threatened Fauna Recovery Project: Southern Jarrah Forest</p>","<p><strong>SW Threatened Fauna Recovery Project Background</strong></p>
<p>Over the last 200 years, 50 per cent of the world&rsquo;s mammal extinctions have occurred in Australia (Short and Smith 1994). In Western Australia alone, 12 mammals and two birds have become extinct and at 30 June 2015, 39 terrestrial mammals and 23 terrestrial birds native to the State were classified as being threatened with extinction. Of these, three mammals and two birds are ranked as critically endangered. In mammals, most extinctions and declines have occurred in medium size species, in the so called &lsquo;critical weight range&rsquo; of 35g to 5500g (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989).</p>
<p>Predation by feral cats and foxes is a key threatening process in the decline of many, if not all, of these species. Foxes have been successfully controlled for many years in a range of locations across Western Australia using dried meat sausage baits containing 1080 poison. Over a decade of research by Parks and Wildlife scientists has led to the development of the Eradicat&reg; feral cat bait, a moister meat bait, also containing 1080, that is more palatable to feral cats. Eradicat&reg; was registered for operational use in Western Australia in December 2014, providing the opportunity to integrate broadscale feral cat control with existing fox baiting programs and other actions, such as translocation, that are implemented to improve the recovery of threatened native animals.</p>
<p>On 16 July 2015, the Minister for Environment, Hon. Albert Jacob MLA, and the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Hon. Greg Hunt MP, announced $1.7 million in funding for the Department of Parks and Wildlife to assist threatened animal recovery. The funding will be used to integrate the new Eradicat&reg; feral cat bait with current fox baiting in four different Western Australian environments. Sites have been specifically selected to direct the funding to improving conservation of species identified in the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Threatened Species Strategy and to align with fauna recovery programs already underway or planned by Parks and Wildlife in the south-west of WA.</p>
<p>This project fits within a broader suite of actions delivered by Parks and Wildlife to reduce the impacts of feral cats and foxes on threatened species in Western Australia. This includes Western Shield, the Integrated Fauna Recovery Project on the south coast, Rangelands Restoration at Matuwa and many other smaller scale projects.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the project is to contribute to the recovery of key threatened mammal and bird species found at each of these sites, through integrating feral cat baiting with existing fox baiting to reduce the impact of introduced predators, and undertaking translocations to establish new, secure populations, where necessary.</p>
<p>While the Eradicat&reg; feral cat bait is a key tool in achieving effective feral cat control, other methods, such as shooting and/or trapping, may also be employed. For example, some individual cats appear to be reluctant to take baits or local climatic conditions may reduce the effectiveness of baiting alone.&nbsp; Some flexibility is built into the project plan to allow this suite of control options to be employed, as necessary.</p>
<p>The project is funded for three years over the 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 financial years. A project agreement has been signed with the Commonwealth Government outlining funding to be provided in each financial year and key deliverables.</p>
<p><strong>Dryandra Woylie/Numbat project</strong></p>
<p>The woylie and numbat are iconic WA species.&nbsp; Recovery with fox control resulted in the woylie being the first fauna species to be removed from the State (and subsequently Commonwealth) threatened species lists in 1996.&nbsp; It was relisted in 2008 following a dramatic decline in numbers, and following continuing declines was ranked as Critically Endangered in 2014.&nbsp; The numbat is ranked as Endangered and has also continued to undergo population decline at some sites, including Dryandra.</p>
<p>Since the mid 2000&rsquo;s woylie numbers in particular have declined at Dryandra.&nbsp; This is a trend for most known non-fenced wild populations in W.A. The State Government has committed to safeguarding woylies and numbats from predators in Dryandra Woodland through an election commitment in 2013. This project outline is based upon the spirit of this announcement; to preserve the numbat and woylie at Dryandra.</p>
<p>The Woodland is one of the most important areas for fauna conservation in the State. Woylie and numbat populations within the Woodland are genetically valuable and the localised extinction of either species would result in an irreparable loss of genetic diversity of the species. It could also potentially reduce opportunities for visitors to the Woodland to see these animals in the wild.</p>
<p>There is published evidence that feral cats are now the primary predator of both woylies in the Woodland (Marlow et al 2015a), with feral cats having become an emerging predator as fox numbers have been reduced (Marlow et al 2015b). Recent research also implicates feral cats in the decline of numbats (DPaW, unpublished data). There has and continues to be active research into the cause of the decline and effective techniques to control feral cats and this project draws on this knowledge in an attempt to undertake feral cat control at an operational scale. This project acknowledges that baiting alone may not be effective in mitigating feral cat numbers and predation, and consequently additional effort and tools will be incorporated in an attempt to prevent the local extinction of woylies and numbats in the Woodland.</p>","<p>To contribute to the long term recovery of the wild populations of woylies and numbats at Dryandra Woodland through:</p>

</table>","<p>Marlow, N.J., Thomas, N.D., Williams, A.A.E., Macmahon, B., Lawson, J., Hitchen, Y., Angus, J., and Berry, O. (2015a) Cats (Felis catus) are more abundant and are the dominant predator of woylies (Bettongia penicillata) after sustained fox (Vulpes vulpes) control. <em>Australian Journal of Zoology</em> <strong>63</strong>(1), 18.</p>
<p>Marlow, N.J., Thomas, N.D., Williams, A.A.E., Macmahon, B., Lawson, J., Hitchen, Y., Angus, J., and Berry, O. (2015b) Lethal 1080 baiting continues to reduce European Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) abundance after more than 25&nbsp;years of continuous use in south-west Western Australia. <em>Ecological Management &amp; Restoration</em> <strong>16</strong>(2), 131-141.</p>","<p><strong>a) Monitoring Feral Cats and Foxes</strong></p>
<p>A landscape camera trap grid design is used to monitor introduced predators and native species. This has been established at Dryandra since 2014. The design was informed by a 60 day pilot study that tested transects vs grids, and lures vs non-lures.</p>
<p>Sixty camera traps with a constrained randomisation are distributed across the main central block of Dryandra with a minimum distance of 750m between cameras. All cameras are offset 50 m from boundaries and tracks (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Cameras are placed on 450 mm plastic peg, facing south. Vegetation within approximately 3 m in front of cameras is pruned to near ground level. No lures are used. Cameras are serviced every ~2 months with cards and batteries changed.</p>
<p>Approaches to analysis are still being trialled but recognise that these can only provide information on trends in introduced predator activity over time and space. Data can be presented as</p>
<ul>
<li>Species sccumulation analysis</li>
<li>Detection Rates</li>
<li>Activity (i.e. heat maps)</li>
<li>Occupancy</li>
<li>Cusum control charts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only provided indices and/or trends (i.e. occupancy, relative abundance, activity)</li>
<li>Time to process images</li>
<li>Space to store data</li>
<li>Time lag between analysis and informing management actions (i.e. targeting feral activity hotspots)</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneously collect data on native species and species assemblages</li>
<li>Effective and consistent data collection</li>
<li>Capture landscape scale data over long temporal sequences</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b) Monitoring Woylies</strong></p>
<p>Woylies at Dryandra will be monitored by targeted trapping events and long-term camera trap monitoring. Targeted trapping will incorporate two transects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Western Shield trapping of 75 cage traps set along a pre-existing transect, at 200m interval (see Figure 2)</li>
<li>York Williams transect of 50 traps set at 200m intervals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both transects will be undertaken in Autumn and Spring each year.</p>
<p>Camera traps will be used to monitor introduced predator and native fauna activity (see section a).</p>
<p><strong>c) Monitoring Numbats</strong></p>
<p><u>Post translocation monitoring</u></p>
<p>All numbats released will be fitted with radio-collars (Biotrack Pip3 Ag357 with brass collar).&nbsp; These collars weigh 6-7g, less than 2% of the body weight of a small numbat.</p>
<p>The fate of individuals will be determined by monitoring at weekly intervals for the first month, then monthly for six months. A forensic investigation will be conducted into any death recorded, including swabbing of the collar for predator DNA and comparison of carcass and site information with a database of previous numbat deaths.&nbsp; DNA swabs will be submitted to a suitable laboratory, such as Helix Molecular Solutions, for predator identification (species level) and genotyping of cat or fox DNA (individual level).</p>
<p><u>Standard annual monitoring</u></p>
<p>Driven surveys to measure sighting rates along a set transect of 362 km are carried out in the main block of Dryandra in April and November each year. This transect is driven six times during each survey and all sightings are &nbsp;recorded. The data collected contribute to a sighting rate (sightings/100 km).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Site Baiting Prescription</strong></p>
<p>Monthly ground fox baiting (Jan, Feb, March, July, Aug, Nov, Dec) + feral cat baiting in other months (April, May, June, Sept, Oct)</p>
<p>Each month of fox baiting includes 1330 Probaits&reg; distributed at 200m intervals along tracks in the main block.</p>
<p>Each month of cat baiting (March-May) includes 2660 Eradicat&reg; baits distributed at 100m intervals along tracks in the main block.</p>
<p>Other complementary measures including with neighbours: Targeted fox and feral cat baiting, trapping and shooting around perimeter of reserve. Trial of raised platform trapping within main block of the Woodland. Encourage trapping, shooting and baiting on neighbouring lands.</p>",granted,False,,not required,True,granted,"<ul>

The flora of Western Australia is inadequately known and insufficiently studied. Putative new taxa are discovered through survey, herbarium studies and by observant members of the public. Many of the new taxa so discovered are appropriately dealt with and formally described in the context of revisionary studies by specialist botanists in the Western Australian Herbarium and elsewhere in Australia and the world. Others, however, particularly putative new taxa in smaller genera or in genera for which there are no active revisionary studies, are in danger of being set aside – phrase-named – for a substantial period of time.

 

 

This Plan relates to occasional taxonomic studies in such poorly-served groups, arising on an as-needs basis. A typical scenario occurred with the discovery of two putative new taxa, one in _Banksia_ and one in _Darwinia,_ by DEC volunteers Fred & Jean Hort. Morphological assessments confirmed that the species were clearly distinct, and they were formally described in single-species papers in _Nuytsia (Thiele,_ 2009, 2010). Similar work has been done in a series of papers on the genus _Hibbertia_ (Thiele 2009a,b; Thiele & Wege 2009).

 

While the work under this plan often results in single-species papers rather than revisionary studies, it nevertheless contributes significantly to our knowledge of the Western Australian flora and reduces the likelihood of a taxon remaining phrase-named, with little supporting information or identification tools, for extended periods.

 

A second common scenario involves dealing with taxa that have been listed as phrase-named or manuscript names on the Census of Western Australian Plants for a considerable period with little ongoing activity, and to either remove them from the Census, with a Short Communication in Nuytsia, or to describe them as new. An example is _Epiblema grandiflorum var. cyaneum ms_, a putative new DRF taxon that has remained on the Census for many years despite evidence that it represents a mere colour variant of the colour-variable _E. grandiflorum_, and has been the subject of Recovery Planning expenditures and management efforts. Following assessment, this taxon was removed from the Census (Thiele & Brown, 2011) and hence removed from Department funding priorities.

The flora of Western Australia is inadequately known and insufficiently studied. Potential new taxa are discovered through survey, herbarium studies and by observant members of the public. 

 

 

The genera _Ptilotus_ (Amaranthaceae) and Swainsona (Fabaceae) are important and common in arid regions of Western Australia, with some taxa occurring also in more mesic areas such as the south-west. There has been a need for studies into these genera in regards to newly discovered species and a review of currently named taxa. A Flora of Australia treatment of Amaranthaceae is under preparation with Terena Lally (CANB) and Tony Bean (BRI). Some species complexes within Ptilotus need review and a number of phrased-named taxa require formal names and descriptions. New taxa in Ptilotus, such as a rare new species first collected in 2010 on the Swan Coastal Plain, are discovered from time to time.

 

 

While there are some old conventional dichotomous keys to Ptilotus, there is a need for the development of up to date electronic keys to _Ptilotus, Gomphrena_ (a related genus in Amaranthaceae) and _Swainsona._ These will assist other botanists, DEC staff, environmental consultants and members of the public with their assessments of regional development proposals, particularly in our north-west where these genera are most common.

","Within the history of forest and natural landscape management in Western Australia many invertebrates are known to utilize forest biomass for their survival and in doing so impart some form of damage to leaves, shoot, roots, stems or branches. There are 10 recognized invertebrate species with demonstrated significant impact on tree health, vitality and timber quality within our natural environment. These are: Attractocerus krusleri (pin hole borer); Creiis periculosa (western horned lerp), Cardiaspina jerramungae (brown basket lerp); Perga spp (saw fly); Perthida glyphopa (jarrah leaf-miner, JLM); Perthida glyphopa ssp rudis (flooded gum leaf miner); Phoracantha acanthocera (bullseye borer, formerly known as Tryphocaria acanthocera, BEB); Phoracantha impavida (tuart borer); Phoracantha semipunctata and Uraba lugens (gumleaf skeletonizer, GLS) (Abbott 1992, Abbott 1995, Abbott 1993, Abbott et al 1991, Abbott et al 1993, Clay and Majer 2001). Of the species listed above, JLM, BEB and GLS are currently the most prevalent insect pests of concern in native forests such that both JLM and GLS have documented population outbreak periods (Abbott 1993, Farr 2004, Strelein 1988) and BEB incidence appears to be responsive to drought stress and likely to increase (Farr et al 2000, Wills 2011). However, Western Australian forests and woodlands also have a history of developing unexpected insect outbreaks with dramatic consequences for the ecosystem health and vitality. For example, in 1982 a previously unknown species of Cardiaspina severely defoliated large areas of Eucalyptus occidentalis in the Lower great Southern (Farr 1992, 1999).

The decline in mean annual rainfall in the south-west Western Australia since the 1970s is well documented (Hughes 2003, McKellar 2010), and global climate models predict that the trend to a warmer and dryer environment will intensify. Thus conditions for invertebrate pests will alter significantly in the next decade as our environment shifts toward a new climatic regime. Baseline populations of known forest and woodland invertebrate pests such as those mentioned above will shift, establishing new population equilibria. Although some currently recognised invertebrate species may drop in population, many of the new baseline pest population levels may be above thresholds that the associated environment can sustain for prolonged periods and as a consequence will be recognised as outbreak populations.  It has long been recognized that water stress induces insect outbreaks, particularly in forest environments (White 1993). Research into GLS and BEB in south-west Western Australia support this (Farr et al 2004, Farr 2002, Farr 2000, Farr et al 2000). Evidence from Forestcheck monitoring since 2001 suggest other recognised potential forest pests such as helena gum moth (Opodiphthera helena) and cup moth (Doratifera spp) are also increasing in abundance (Farr et al 2009).  Furthermore accidental introductions of non-indigenous invertebrate species (both intra- and trans- continental) are a potential for new forest pest problems for both known and formerly unknown pest species, the impacts of which could be exacerbated by a changing climate once populations are established. One introduced species already falls into this category, namely Phylacteophaga froggatti (the non-indigenous leaf blister sawfly).  Other examples include species of psyllid within the genus Cardiaspina which have been introduced to WA within the last 10 years.  These particular species (C. fiscella; C. albitextura or C. densitexta, specific identity yet to be confirmed) regularly develop into serious outbreak levels in eastern Australia (Collett 2001, Morgan 1984) and therefore already have a recognised potential to seriously impact on our environment.  Also of relevance is that since the south-west of WA has one of the least known invertebrate faunas globally, some emergent species are likely to be currently unknown, or, at the very least there will be little known about their biology.

This Science Project Plan therefore targets both recognised and new forest pests in terms of research directed toward understanding their biology, population dynamics, forest and environmental impacts, the influence of departmental management regimes on such populations and potentials for the implementation of adaptive management strategies to ameliorate such events if possible. Primary pest species will be targeted, rather than secondary pest species naturally dependent on a host with declining health. This project will augment strategies being developed for Forest health Surveillance as outline in the current and new Forest Management Plan (2014-23).

Department of Environment and Conservation. Unpublished Report.</p>","<p>Detailed methods will vary according to the pest under study. Here a basic approach to study of a new recognised insect pest is outlined (ref: Robinson et al. 1998).</p>
<p>Research will be directed into five main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey</li>
</ul>
<p>Pest distribution, measurement of the area affected and/or potential area to be affected. Survey method will depend on the nature of the outbreak expression. Pests causing some form of visual damage (e.g. canopy defoliation) can be assessed using aerial and/or ground based observation, including drive-by surveys. This would be coupled with satellite imagery and GIS techniques where possible to establish reference guidelines for future remote sensing applications for the specific pest of interest.  If GIS techniques are applicable to the pest, further development of this technology can be applied to determine for example areas of forest more prone to attack (see Farr et al 2004).</p>
<ul>
<li>Population level</li>
</ul>
<p>Population size will be determined using an absolute measure for repeatable comparison over space and time. Measurements will be of the actual organism involved (i.e. egg, juvenile, adult) or an aspect of its impact on its host (e.g. shot holes/mines in leaves as for JLM; frass expulsion vents as for BEB), relative to a standard such as leaf area, leaf weight, number of tree boles, area of tree bole; forest area, ground area etc. This can be achieved through direct sampling such as branch clipping, or litter searching within a quadrat, transect or per tree and will ultimately depend on the nature of the invertebrate under study. The sample unit will also be stratified where possible to reduce variation.<br />
Indirect measurements of populations will be achieved by methods including light, pheromone, sticky, pitfall and other appropriate trapping applications. With these methods the population will be measured in unknown units allowing for comparisons in space and time only (Southwood 1989). Such population measures are often less demanding on time and resources and are a useful quantitative monitoring tool in the longer term, however since this method does not give an absolute population measure it will be done in conjunction with a more defined population measure in the first instance. Once such a relationship has been determined population levels will be monitored using the method less demanding on resources/time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Impact</li>
</ul>
<p>Development of damage thresholds relative to pest population using criteria such as leaf area index, dry foliage weight, area of tree bole, and/or related to forest areas affected by the pest as determined from the distribution survey. Since in most cases the pest will be indigenous to WA forests, damage thresholds relative to population levels need to be considered in respect to consideration of “reasonable” population densities for the pest involved in order to maintain and effective “balanced” population.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pest biology and phenology</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the emergence of a pest species, knowledge on its biology, phenology and pathology will be variable. Considerable information may be available for already recognised pests but for some species there will be little or no biological information. Biological features such as host range, life cycle, egg production, parasites, survival and mortality, will be examined where such knowledge will benefit population management and understanding the nature of the pest in respect to its forest ecology. More focused studies on particular aspects of the pest biology e.g. thermal thresholds, micro habitat requirements etc. may need to be achieved through a more academic approach such as a dedicated PhD study. This will be taken into consideration as the need arises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adaptive management to ameliorate outbreaks and impacts</li>
</ul>
<p>Trapping using pheromones or other means specific to the target organism (if available) can be used to monitor pest populations and determine periods when populations start to rise above levels normally supported in the forest environment.  This allows determination of factors which contribute to population increases using meta-data analysis and GIS technology.  Furthermore application of these trapping techniques can, in some cases, be used to target population hot spots in order to dampen dramatic population fluctuations. A potential example of this is the possible application of “SPLAT” technology for the control of GLS.</p>",required,False,<p>As required for new and developing invertebrate pests and their associated pathological fauna.</p>,not required,False,not required,"<p>Numerical data will be included in “Access” data bases which will be lodged on the T share drive at Manjimup and on the Data custodian's computer.

729,"This SPP is designed to include localised terrestrial fauna surveys and monitoring, and complements the Western Australian Wetland Fauna Survey project (new SPP). Larger survey projects with similar methods and objectives are the biological surveys of the Carnarvon Basin, Wheatbelt (SPP1998-020), Pilbara (SPP2004-002 and 2004-004) and Kimberley islands (2007-001).
"," 

The Department of Environment and Conservation (with the assistance of the WA Museum) has a long-standing commitment to undertaking regional biogeographic surveys of the State. Since the 1970s, there have been major regional surveys of the Eastern Goldfields, Nullarbor, Kimberley rainforests, southern Carnarvon Basin, the Wheatbelt and the Pilbara (e.g. McKenzie et al. 1991; Burbidge et al. 2000; Keighery et al. 2004, George et al. 2011). Other major surveys cover parts of the Kimberley islands, Great Sandy Desert, Gibson Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Dampier Peninsula, Murchison, Gascoyne, southern forests and numerous existing and proposed conservation reserves (e.g. Miles and Burbidge 1975; Burbidge and McKenzie 1983; Gibson and McKenzie 2012, Keighery et al. 2007). These surveys have underpinned the selection of areas for the conservation reserve system, provided information to determine conservation status of species and filled significant gaps in biodiversity knowledge. While these large scale surveys provide analyses of biodiversity patterning for regional-scale conservation planning, sites are usually too sparse and often lack detail at finer scales. The more localised surveys undertaken will fill spatial and/or habitat gaps in the larger surveys, extend geographic coverage, assist in resolving taxonomic issues, increase ecological understanding, provide information on fine-scale biodiversity patterns and in many cases complement regional surveys.

 
","<p>The aims of the surveys covered by this SPP are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide understanding of landscape scale terrestrial fauna biodiversity and concomitant patterning to inform local conservation planning and as baselines for future monitoring.</li>
<li>To provide better data on the distribution, ecological tolerances and conservation status of terrestrial species and communities.</li>
</ul>","<p>The immediate aims of the individual projects vary depending on the needs of the funding source, but usually contribute to improved species distributional and ecological understanding, prioritizing conservation actions by local managers and/or assessing potential environmental impacts of land use proposals.</p>
<p>Individual survey projects: Ability of regional conservation managers to understand local biodiversity patterning and its underlying drivers and use it to a) assess environmental impacts, b) prioritise conservation actions, c) set biodiversity targets d) establish baselines for monitoring and e) monitor change.</p>
<p>Projects in combination: Improved understanding of species distributions and habitat requirements at a State level. This will contribute to bioregionalisation analyses, analysis of species’ conservation status and analyses of the relationships between species and broad scale gradients and threats such as climate change.    </p>","<p>Primary users of the knowledge coming out of these projects are Commonwealth government agencies and/or facilitated projects (e.g. ABRS, ANHAT, TERN, ACRIS), DEC conservation managers, including those in regional offices, Species and Communities Branch, Natural Resources Management Branch and Environmental Management Branch and WA Museum. This knowledge is primarily transferred to the above users via reports (e.g. Cowan 2011, Cowan and Parkin 2012), physical data and oral presentations tailored to the needs of particular users (usually those that provided the funding). </p>","<p>There are no set timelines for this SPP as it covers one or more surveys at a time, each with their own milestones and timelines.

","In June 2011 the Western Australian Government released the Kimberley Science and Conservation Strategy (KSCS) with its overarching aim to recognize and conserve one of the world’s last great wilderness areas. Funding for the KSCS was announced as part of the State budget and included $12 M over 6 years, from 2011/12, for the Kimberley Marine Research Program (KMRP). The goal of the KMRP is to undertake a program of marine research to support the management of the proposed State marine parks at Camden Sound, North Kimberley, Roebuck Bay and Eighty Mile Beach and the coastal waters outside of these proposed marine parks. The KMRP will be developed and implemented through the Western Australian Marine Science Institution (WAMSI), with DEC as lead agency responsible for the direction, coordination and administration of the research program.

A research plan for the KMRP is being developed in consultation with DEC marine resource manageres and scientists to address priority research and information needs to support the management of ecological and social values in the Kimberley region. The plan will comprise a suite of research projects focussed around two themes:

  * **_Bio-physical and social characterization_** \- to provide the foundational datasets required for marine park and marine resource management as well as better understanding and managing current human impacts; and
  * **_Understanding key ecosystem processes_** – to provide the scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and response to a range of potential human impacts that are likely to arise in the future, including climate change.
The Marine Science Program of DEC will lead the research program, providing guidance on project development to address key State priorities and providing science administration, coordiination and integration throughout the 6 year research program. A critical role in this regard will be the transfer of knowledge gained through the research to the relevant resource managers and operational staff as well as to the community.

748,,,"<p>1.  What are the objectives?</p>
<p>This project seeks options for facilitating climate adaptation by targeting the question ""Can adaptive variation in widespread species be used to enhance resilience to climate change and maintain ecological function in landscape restoration investments?""</p>
<p>2.  What are the deliverables?</p>
<p>The project will deliver a new framework for determining the most climate-resilient genotypes within eucalypt species for use in landscape revegetation, commercial plantings and other restoration approaches. Multi-million dollar investments in restoration of Australia’s degraded and fragmented multi-use landscapes currently take little account of climate change. Until recently there has been a strong focus on maintaining local genetic patterns for optimal restoration. In a changing climate this paradigm may no longer be relevant and a new framework is urgently needed. The proposed project will deliver such a framework by undertaking pioneering research and development at the interface between molecular genetics, plant physiology and climate adaptation. Specifically, it will test hypotheses of adaptation in widespread eucalypt species, by investigating correlations between key physiological traits and genetic signatures of adaptation across climatic gradients utilising recent advances in eucalypt genomics. Addressing this question will ensure optimal, climate-resilient outcomes for Australia-wide investment in ecological restoration, offering a novel solution to ecosystem adaptation in changing environments. </p>
<p>3. What is the timeline?</p>
<p>The project will be undertaken from 1 October 2011 to 28 March 2013. Field design and sampling will be completed by December 2011, ecophysiology and genetic analyses will be completed by April 2012 and combined analysis and interpretation will be completed by July 2012.  Production of report, journal articles and communication of project results will be undertaken by December 2012.</p>","<p>Milestone</p>

The project design was informed by twenty years experience working directly with end-users (farmers, state and federal agencies and non-government organizations) in agricultural landscapes thus ensuring that it has practical application in land management. The Principal Investigators have a strong track-record in end-user engagement that provides an effective path to adoption for the research outcomes and maximises the impact of the project. The Principal Investigators are also members of the scientific advisory group for the Great Western Woodlands Conservation Strategy that is the subject of a major policy commitment of the WA Government. Investigators at UTAS are involved in adaptive genetic research backing the development of resilient carbon and restoration tree plantings with Greening Australia as well as research supporting the management of native forest gene pools with the CRC for Forestry which includes State Agencies managing large native forest estates. Direct involvement with government agencies and NGO’s will enable the project team to influence policy frameworks for assisted migration as a climate change adaptation strategy. To ensure end-user engagement from the start of the project, we propose to establish a Reference Group comprising individuals from a range of organizations that are directly involved in on-ground revegetation. Consultation with the reference group will be undertaken prior to sampling to seek advice on project design including identification of species and appropriate site locations for sampling. The reference group will also be consulted in relation to the interpretation of research findings and their implications for industry practice. The group will play a role in technology transfer and dissemination of information to relevant end users, by reviewing extension materials and demonstrating adoption of recommendations into practice. We anticipate the following end user products will be produced from the project: a) project report, b) technical article, c) information Sheet, including recommendations for revegetation practice. We will disseminate these products with the assistance of the reference group through Information days, websites of NGOs and state agencies (eg. GERI, GondwanaLink, SWAEI, GWW Initiative, DEC WA, DECC NSW), and industry publications, mailing lists and communication networks</p>",,"<p>Hoegh-Guldberg O, Hughes L, McIntyre S, Lindenmayer DB, Parmesan C, Possingham HP, Thomas CD (2008) Assisted colonization and rapid climate change.

(eds). Grass Systematics and Evolution. pp 267-278.</p>","<p>Ecological restoration to maximise climate resilience is likely to be at odds with current genetic paradigms used to inform restoration (Pertoldi et al. 2007). Until recently, there has been a strong theoretical and practical focus on maintaining local genetic patterns of variation and associated genetic-environmental relationships. Inappropriate sourcing of seed for revegetation can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including founder effects, genetic swamping of local populations, and outbreeding depression (Hufford and Mazer 2003). Yet in a changing climate, maintenance of ecological function will be imperative and a static view of genetic-environmental relationships may no longer be relevant. Strategies to maximise resilience (Hoegh-Gulberg et al. 2008) should instead utilise the adaptive variation present in key species to facilitate persistence of plantings and maintain ecosystem and landscape function.</p>
<p>Identifying adaptive variation requires targeted analysis of eco-physiological traits and signatures of adaptation reflecting differential regulation of genes during stress (water availability or temperature). Studies of eco-physiological trait variability along climatic gradients in Australia are beginning to provide insights into the adaptability of native taxa, especially Eucalyptus species (e.g. Schulze et al. 2006). Correlation of variation in eco-physiological traits with variation in gene frequency will provide a molecular basis for predicting the adaptive response of species to differing climatic environments and provide tools for identification of appropriate adaptation management responses in multi-use landscapes where maintenance of ecosystem function is critical.</p>
<p>The project will test the following alternative hypotheses:</p>
<p>1. Widespread species, having evolved under highly variable environments, retain high potential for adaptability to environmental change within the gene pool of local populations or individuals (implying that genetic material sourced from local populations will have tolerance to changing climatic conditions).</p>
<p>2. Widespread species, having evolved across wide ecological gradients, comprise a suite of locally adapted sub-populations each (implying that genetic material should be sourced not from local populations but from distant and potentially resilient populations which are pre-adapted to the future climate).</p>
<p>The project will be implemented along the following lines, focusing on widespread eucalypt species spanning climatic gradients across the Western Australian wheatbelt and Great Western Woodlands, and the box woodlands of the eastern Australian wheatbelt.</p>
<p>1. Identify target eucalypt species and physiological traits relevant to climate change (e.g. specific leaf area, instantaneous water use efficiency, season length water use efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, stomatal conductance).</p>
<p>2. Characterize variation in selected physiological traits within and between populations across climatic gradients.</p>
<p>3. Analyse patterns of adaptive genetic variation within and between populations across the same environmental gradients. This will be achieved via a genome scan using DArT markers developed at University of Tasmania.</p>
<p>4. Combined analysis of ecophysiological and genetic data to evaluate potential effectiveness of the genome scan approach for detecting adaptive variation across environmental gradients.</p>
<p>5. Integrate findings into decision tools for evaluation of assisted migration and sourcing genetic material for ecological restoration and revegetation under the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>The following methodology will be used in the project:</p>
<p>Species selection – The project will study eucalypt species of the intensive agricultural zones of southern Australia, including one species from the east and one from the west. Eucalyptus is the choice of genus for this work because (1) it is the most important genus used in revegetation and forestry across southern Australia and (2) it is the only native genus in Australia for which DArT markers have been developed (other species where DArT markers are available are those used in agricultural enterprises). DArT markers offer an exciting new opportunity to undertake the genome scans required for this study, and analysis is available through Diversity Array Technologies (Canberra).</p>
<p>Criteria for species selection within Eucalyptus are that they are widely used in revegetation in the relevant regions, and that they are widespread across rainfall gradients. We propose to use E. melliodora or E. blakelyi in the east, as they are widespread species capturing a rainfall gradient of &gt;800 mm (Fig. 1) and used for revegetation across the eastern-Australian wheat-sheep zone. In Western Australia we propose to use E. salubris or the E. loxophleba complex. Both of these are prominent in revegetation in the WA wheatbelt and cover the widest rainfall gradient available. Final confirmation of species selections will be made in consultation with the reference Group (see (ii) below).</p>
<p>Sampling – Sampling aims to characterize physiological and adaptive genetic variation within and between populations of each species. Climatic details (rainfall, temperature, aridity index) for selected species will be sourced from Bureau of Meteorology SILO data and Atlas of Living Australia (ALA), and visualised using ALA and GIS technology. Nine populations will be selected across the gradient to maximise the climatic range, using a combined grouped endpoint / dispersed sampling strategy.</p>
<p>Data generation – Genetic data will be generated by undertaking DNA extraction and DArT marker assays for 30 sampled trees from each population. Ecophysiological data will be generated from leaf and wood samples from 10 trees in each population. Leaf analyses will include plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, total nitrogen and phosphorus, and carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen isotope (δ<sup>15</sup>N) ratios - measures reflecting responses to water deficits or arid conditions integrated across periods of approximately one year. Wood density will be measured as an integrated measure of water stress over longer periods. Soil nutrient analysis will also be undertaken at each site to account for interactions with site management history.</p>
<p>Data analysis – The ecophysiological data will be analysed to determine patterns of variation across the climate gradient. The genotypic data will be analysed to detect differential signatures of adaptation, and variation in the markers will be correlated with environmental and ecophysiological variation. Data analysis techniques will include multiple regression to determine univariate relationships between measured variables and climate data (using Genstat) and ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling and principal components analysis, using PC-Ord) to simultaneously assess relationships among populations and all measured traits.</p>",required,False,,not required,False,not required,<p>Maintained on T drive with backup</p>,,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, OVertime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"
751,"This SPP is designed to include small flora survey projects such as the Bush Blitz surveys of Cane River and Credo Stations. Larger survey projects with similar methods and objectives are the biological surveys of the BIF and Greenstone ranges (SPP 2007-005) and the Ravensthorpe Range survey (SPP 2007-.006).
"," 

There have been a number of regional and subregional scale flora surveys in Western Australia, While the larger scale surveys provide analyses of biodiversity patterning for regional-scale conservation planning, sites are usually too sparse for more local scale planning. However, the larger surveys can be used to identify subregions of high biodiversity (such as Biodiversity Recovery Catchments in the Wheatbelt), which then require more detailed survey for local conservation planning. Subregional surveys have higher sampling densities are provide an assessment of conservation significance and the context for future development proposals such as the studies on the Swan Coastal Plain (Gibson et al. 1994), the BIF ranges (Gibson et al. 2012). Recently the Biogeography Program has been asked to undertake a number of smaller scale surveys for particular purposes such as Naturebank (preliminary surveys of areas of interest in Cape Le Grand National Park, Fitzgerald River National Park) and Bush Blitz surveys of Cane River and Credo Station funded by DSEWPaC. Presently these short duration surveys do not fall within any current SPP, the proposed SPP would capture these projects into our reporting framework.

 
","<p>The aims of the surveys covered by this SPP are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide understanding of small scale floristic biodiversity patterning to inform local conservation planning and as baselines for future monitoring.</li>
<li>To provide better data on the distribution and conservation status of flora species and vegetation communities.</li>
</ul>","<p>Knowledge of the distribution of species and composition of communities has a myriad of benefits to DEC’s core conservation work. Data collected to date has been used as baselines for monitoring management actions, prioritization of conservation actions based on survey results, identification of threatened ecological communities and assessment of species conservation status. Some of this data could also be used for environmental impact assessment. Voucher collections and site based species records will help build the State’s database of the distribution of the flora into the future.</p>","<p>Primary users of the knowledge coming out of these projects are DEC conservation managers, including those in regional offices, Species and Communities Branch, Natural Resources Management Branch and Environmental Management Branch.</p>","<p>There are no set timelines for this SPP as it covers one or more surveys at a time, each with their own milestones and timelines.

The contribution of canker fungi to stem and branch death in South Western Australia has largely been ignored (Davison & Tay 1983, Shearer 1992). Past records have shown that two days with temperatures over 40ºC and high winds was associated with rapid extension of _Botryosphaeria _sp. lesions in _Banksia speciosa _leading to the death of affected trees near Hopetoun (Shearer 1994). Since 1994 there has been a steady increase in canker reports and samples received for identification particularly in the declared rare flora _Banksia verticillata_, _B.brownii _as well as non threatened taxa such as _B. baxteri, B. coccinea_, and _B. sessilis_. South Coast Regional staff have expressed concern that many of the natural populations of _B. anatona, B. verticillata_ and _Lambertia orbifolia_ spp. _orbifolia_ (including a translocated population) DRF appear to be succumbing to canker by degrees. Families outside the Proteaceae are also impacted, eg. _Acacia accuminatus _and _Calothamnus quadrifidus _are also recorded as having high rates of branch and stem cankers (Pathogen of the month 2007, DEC records).

 

Observation and increase in sample numbers suggests that the incidence and severity of these events is increasing which indicates a shift in the host/pathogen/environment disease triangle has occurred. As the hosts are endemic and the pathogens also appear endemic this leaves environmental change as the likely reason for the change in impact. Quantification of canker incidence and severity requires semi permanent transects to be established and monitored across the region and compared simultaneously with climatic data.

 

Direct therapy for the affected hosts is one management option available within a holistic disease management strategy. As Denman (2004) has been able to show reduced canker activity with application of several fungicides in _Protea magnifica _in the field it is quite likely that these fungicides will be capable of reducing impact of cankers in affected species particularly _B. verticillata_ and_ L. orbifolia _in the South Coast of Western Australia.

779,,"Human-mediated landscape disturbance can affect the amount of genetic diversity present in populations of threatened species and its distribution across the landscape. One challenge facing conservation managers is understanding how management tools can be used to protect and facilitate genetic and demographic patterns and processes. For example, reserve design principles (comprehensiveness, adequacy, representativeness (CAR); single large or several small (SLOSS)) can be applied to conserve genetic diversity, as well as species diversity (Moritz & Faith 1998; Vandergast _et al._ 2008, Thomassen _et al._ 2011). New approaches in phylogeography and landscape genetics are being used to investigate patterns of contemporary and historical infraspecific diversity in a spatially-explicit context (Vandergast _et al._ 2008, Dudaneic _et al._ 2013). In combination with predictive modeling these datasets can be used in conservation planning for achieving CAR in reserve design, as well as inferring refugia under future climate change.   
  
Our initial work will focus on genetic diversity of quenda (or southern brown bandicoot, _Isoodon obesulus_ _fusciventer_) in fragmented coastal populations compared to populations in intact forest that have greater representation within the reserve system. Quenda are one of the last critical weight range mammals to persist in the Perth metropolitan area, but are increasingly becoming restricted to small, isolated patches of remnant vegetation. We will survey the genetic diversity and genetic structure of quenda populations across the Swan plain and the Darling Range to evaluate the role of reserves in conserving population genetic diversity and maintaining genetic processes such as gene flow.  
  
A second project will employ a comparative phylogeographic approach to investigate the genetic diversity and genetic structure of a range of species in the Pilbara, a region of high endemism and landform diversity under significant conservation pressure. Information on the distribution of genetic diversity within target mammal species will be overlain on climate and environmental GIS datasets generated by DEC to identify environmental conditions and landscape features correlated with high genetic diversity. Analysis of historical population structure will also be used to identify areas in the landscape that have acted as refugia under past climate change. We will then assess how well these features are protected within the current reserve system as well as under future climate change.  
  

","<p>Specifically, to understand the landscape genetics of quenda in the Perth region we will:<br />
•    investigate how much genetic diversity is present in quenda in reserve populations compared to fragmented populations <br />
•    investigate whether gene flow amongst populations is greater in continuous populations compared to fragmented populations<br />
•    identify natural and imposed breaks in continuity between populations in fragmented landscapes and continuous forest and whether there is evidence of animals being able to use corridors for movement in fragmented landscapes<br />
•    use GIS to identify areas of high quality habitat and correlate habitat features with genetic diversity patterns (in conjunction with Swan District office). Taken together these results should highlight important populations and habitat for conservation.<br />
•    understand genetic relationships within and amongst coastal and forest regions to better manage quenda relocations   </p>
<p>To investigate the phylogeography of Pilbara mammal species we will:<br />
•    use phylogenetic approaches to investigate the infraspecific genetic diversity and genetic structure of target mammal species in the Pilbara region<br />
•    map clades identified within each species to the landscape to determine whether a phylogeographic signal is evident<br />
•    use niche-based species distribution modelling to identify environmental factors important for species persistence and correlate these with genetic diversity and gene flow parameters in each species to identify putative refugia<br />
•    use GIS to determine whether patterns of infraspecific diversity and genetic structure are conserved within the current reserve system, and whether putative refugia under future climate change will be adequately conserved  </p>","<p>It is increasingly recognized that conserving species genetic diversity is integral to facilitating species persistence under multiple threats, including predicted climate change. Genetic information when combined with landscape and environmental data provides a powerful tool for conservation planning, including reserve design and prioritisation. These projects will provide insight into the distribution of genetic diversity across a range of species and how the reserve system acts to protect the patterns and processes that generate this diversity. </p>","<p>Information from this project will primarily inform management actions for DPaW Fauna Conservation and Nature Conservation groups for current and future management of <em>I. obesulus</em> in the Perth region, and more broadly will inform development applications particularly in the metropolitan area. Knowledge of the distribution of genetic diversity of key mammal species in- and off-reserve in the Pilbara will be useful information in the context of considering mining development applications. Both projects incorporate a species distribution modeling approach which will be used to predict future distributions of species with climate change.</p>","<p><strong>Task</strong></p>

We will examine genetic diversity and gene flow amongst populations (up to 30 individuals/pop) of quenda across the Swan coastal plain and adjacent Darling Range using 12 published <em>I. obesulus</em> microsatellite markers (Zenger &amp; Johnston, 2001; Li <em>et al.,</em> 2012). We will compare levels of genetic diversity within populations (number of alleles, heterozygosity, allele frequencies; calculated in the program GenAlEx (Peakall &amp; Smouse, 2012) and estimate rates of gene flow between populations using F-statistics (calculated in Genepop, Raymond &amp; Rousset, 1995), and compare these metrics for fragmented vs. continuous populations. We will use the software Structure (Pritchard et al., 2000) to infer the ‘true’ population genetic structure of quenda populations across the Perth region to identify natural or imposed breaks in population continuity. In collaboration with Swan District Office staff, we will attempt to correlate genetic patterns with climate and habitat models using landscape genetic approaches (e.g. using regression analysis between landscape and genetic variables, Dudaneic <em>et al.</em> 2013). These analyses will allow us to identify centres of high genetic diversity and connectivity and to assess how well these areas are represented in the reserve system.    </p>
<p>B. Comparative phylogeography of Pilbara mammal species       <br />
We will examine the population genetic and phylogeographic structure of several mammal species across the Pilbara, including a rocky habitat specialist (e.g. <em>Pseudomys chapmani</em>), a sandy habitat specialist (e.g. <em>P. hermannsbergensis</em>) and a habitat generalist (e.g. <em>Ningaui timealeyi</em>) using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers. We will reconstruct single- and multiple-gene phylogenies using Bayesian inference (implemented in the program MrBayes (Ronquist &amp; Huelsenbeck, 2003)) to identify clades within each species that may be correlated with landscape structure. Niche-based species distribution models will be developed using Maxent software (Elith et al., 2011) with distribution records obtained from DPaW and Atlas of Living Australia databases. Important habitat and climate variables identified during species modeling will be correlated with genetic diversity information to identify areas in the landscape that may have acted as refugia in the past and we will investigate how refugia will be distributed under future climates. Maps of the current distribution of nature reserves in the Pilbara will be overlain onto composite genetic and species distribution maps to investigate how well the reserve system captures current species genetic diversity and future refugial areas, and how congruent this is between species.      </p>",required,False,<p>This project is unlikely to generate novel specimens for vouchering.</p>,not required,False,not required,"<p>Genetic data generated through this project will be stored on the departmental T: drive and/or submitted to public databases, typically as a requirement for publication in scientific journals.

","Aquatic oligochaetes are important components of aquatic systems, playing a similar role in sediment processes tyhat earthworms do in soils (aeration, turnover, carbon dynamics, structuring microbial communities etc). Early work by Brinkhurst (1971, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984) suggested that Australia has considerable diversity and a greater level of endemism amongst the group than any other continent, yet the Australian fauna remained very poorly known.

Between 1992 and 1994 the Australian Biological Resources Study funded Dr Brinkhurst (USA) and Dr Richard Marchant (Museum Victoria) to employ the principal investigator of this SPP (Adrian Pinder) to undertake research on the systematics of this group, resulting in several publications (Pinder and Brinkhurst 1994; 1997abc, 2000; Pinder et al. 1998, Pinder and Erseus 2000).

This current project is a continuation of this work, with a strong emphasis on describing the diversity, biogeography and endemism of the Western Australian aquatic oligochaete fauna, which had been underrepresented in studies undertaken to date.

3346,<p>N/A</p>,"<p>The increases in ocean sprawl, urbanisation and associated modifications of coastal and estuary areas, are driving habitat and biodiversity declines within these ecosystems (Vozzo <em>et al</em>. 2020; Vozzo <em>et al</em>. 2021). Additionally, these changes often lead to the installation of single-purpose coastal infrastructures such as seawalls and breakwaters to reduce shoreline erosion, however, this can result in the removal of complex intertidal zone structures (Bugnot <em>et al</em>. 2020; Nunn <em>et al</em>. 2021; Vozzo <em>et al</em>. 2020; Vozzo et al. 2021). Eco-engineering technologies can be an alternative resource to assist in protecting shorelines, whilst promoting biodiversity and alleviating declines in habitats (Mitsch 2012; Waltham &amp; Sheaves 2018; Bugnot <em>et al</em>. 2020; Vozzo <em>et al</em>. 2020; Vozzo <em>et al</em>. 2021).</p>
<p>Eco-engineered habitats vary in scale and design based on their purpose, the system they are implemented in and the available budget. For example, simplistic changes to structural materials can occur, by substituting concrete and cement with materials that have a lot environmental footprint and improve the casting of habitat structures, such as Reefcrete, a recycled ground granulated blast-furnace slag (Dennis <em>et al</em>. 2018). These alternative materials have been found to support significantly more canopy-forming algae, which may facilitate other taxa (Dennis <em>et al</em>. 2018). By increasing the settlement of micro-organisms, such as algae, more complex organisms can be established, re-establishing predator species that could have been removed from the system when single-purpose structures were implemented (Herbert<em> et al</em>. 2018; Toledo <em>et al</em>. 2020). &nbsp;</p>
<p>New ecoengineering designs are continuously emerging, with companies specialising in the production of a wide range of pre-fabricated reef units that incorporate the use of environmentally conscious materials. Living Seawalls (LSW) is a flagship program of the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS) in collaboration with Reef Design Lab (RDL), that design and produce topographically complex habitat panels that can be retrofitted to existing coastal infrastructures. These habitat panel designs focus on the promotion of foundation species, such as algae, coral, barnacles and oysters, to create superficial structures and further develop the complexity of the panels to promote more mobile species to colonise (Dennis <em>et al</em>. 2018). As a result, they have been proven to restore lost intertidal habitats and improve species diversity along simplistic surfaces of seawalls, bridge footings and other coastal and estuarine infrastructures that typically lack species complexity (Strain <em>et al</em>. 2017; Strain <em>et al</em>. 2018; Strain <em>et al</em>. 2020; Vozzo <em>et al</em>. 2020; Vozzo <em>et al</em>. 2021,). In addition, the re-establishment of foundation species has been found to provide key ecosystem services including improved water quality, fisheries productivity and shoreline protection (Beheshti <em>et al</em>. 2021). As a result, habitat panels and other reef designs that promote foundation species growth are at the forefront of coastal and estuarine initiatives.</p>
<p>The Swan-Canning Estuary (SCE) in Western Australia is a microtidal system situated in the Perth Metropolitan area. As with most urban estuarine systems, the SCE has been subject to ocean sprawl and has undergone heavy modification and development along its shorelines. Additionally, increases in local population and improve accessibility to the SCE have increased boat traffic and recreational activities through the system. Towards the lower end of the estuary, river walls and rock revetments have been used to control erosion caused by wind and boat waves, whereas elsewhere along the system, increased levels of erosion and habitat degradation have occurred, especially in areas where modifications have not been implemented. As existing modifications in the SCE reach the end of their intended lifespan and new structures are built to reduce erosion, the potential to integrate eco-engineered technologies and nature-based solutions could be possible to help increase habitats and reduce shoreline erosion.</p>","<p>Evaluate and incorporate the use of LSW habitat panels along three sections of the river wall within the lower SCE to assess their effectiveness in enhancing habitats. This aim will be achieved by investigating three parts;</p>
<h5><strong>Part 1:</strong></h5>
<p>Provide baseline information on the effectiveness of two commonly used erosion control techniques (rock revetments and seawalls) for enhancing habitat. Species richness and percentage cover will be measured to determine the effectiveness of these structures preceding the instalment of habitat enhancement techniques.</p>
<p>This part of the overarching aim will be addressed by testing the following hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Species richness and functional diversity will be greater along limestone rock revetments compared to limestone seawalls.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Part 2:</strong></h5>
<p>Determine the effectiveness of LSW habitat panels for enhancing habitat percentage cover and richness along stretches of river wall compared to stretches of unmodified walls. Similar to part one, species richness and percentage cover will be used to measure habitat cover. In addition, the influence of exposure and tidal height on habitat provision will be considered.</p>
<p>This part of the overarching aim will be achieved by testing the following hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing habitat panels will result in enhanced habitat complexity, and will increase species richness and functional diversity compared to unmodified seawalls.</li>
<li>The effectiveness of the panels in enhancing richness and diversity will be increased by localised tidal height, the duration each tile spends submerged.</li>
<li>Changes in localised wave exposure will influence establishment rate and species richness.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Part 3:</strong></h5>
<p>Investigate the influence each habitat panel design has on colonisation rates and species diversity on all panels by measuring species richness and percentage cover. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Part three will address the overarching aim by testing the following hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Habitat panels with higher complexities will have a greater influence on the rate of colonisation and diversity in colonising species.</li>
<li>Colonised species will be similar to those observed at similar latitudes across Australia.</li>
<li>The application of habitat panels across different latitudes will influence species diversity and the functional roles of the species.</li>
</ul>","<p>This project will determine the suitability and effectiveness of the Living Seawalls habitat panels within the SCE, with the rate at which individual panel designs recruit benthic habitat growth being evaluated. At a wider scale, the interactions between fish and invertebrate communities and the habitat panels will be assessed to determine the effectiveness of the habitat panels. The outcomes from this project will provide planners with baseline information on how these habitat panels can improve complexities and recruitment rates of species in comparison to unmodified sea walls in a relatively cost-efficient approach. In addition, it will demonstrate that this method can work on existing modified shorelines and proposed modifications.</p>","<p>The project will help to develop knowledge and capability to support the protection and rehabilitation of foreshores and habitats in the SCE and more broadly, the Swan Canning Riverpark. The project is a partnership between DBCA Rivers and Estuaries Science, DBCA Riverbank Management branches with the Town of East Fremantle (ToEF) local government authority. The project also works collaboratively with the LSW project run through SIMS and the RDL in New South Wales and more broadly, alongside The Nature Conservancy (TNC).</p>
<p>Following pre-established LSW protocols the transfer and comparison of data between this trial and other studies both nationally and internationally will be possible. This will allow for the development of open understanding and knowledge sharing around how these types of habitat enhancement approaches respond under differing geographical and environmental scenarios.</p>","<p>Throughout the project timeline, annual reporting in the form of milestone emails will be sent to each of the partners (DBCA Rivers and Estuaries Science, DBCA Riverbank Management and ToEF). These updates can also be sent across to LSW and RDL to give progress updates on how the installed habitat panels are performing.</p>
<p>At the end of the trial, the outcomes will be consolidated into a research report. This report will give in-depth details about the background of the trial, the methodologies used and the results of the study, comparing the habitat complexities of the different panels and the unmodified seawall sections. This report will be provided to each of the partners and will also be provided to LSW and RDL.</p>
<p>As this is the first time a trial using these methods has occurred in WA, a scientific publication of the findings will be produced and submitted to a high-impact journal. From the outset, this trial has been established to follow documented protocols and advice from the DBCA biometrician.</p>","<p>Beheshti, K.M., Williams, S.L., Boyer, K.E., Endris, C., Clemons, A., Grimes, T., Wasson, K. and Hughes, B.B.

Following these protocols will keep methodologies consistent across geographical ranges and allow for future collaborations between DBCA, LSW and other research institutes to occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 1 and 2 will also be assessed using an underwater video survey that follows the <a href=""https://dpaw.sharepoint.com/teams/RiversandEstuariesScience/Habitat%20Enhancement/4.%20Projects/1.%20Living%20Seawalls/1.%20East%20Fremantle/3.%20Protocols%20and%20specifications/LivingSeawalls%20Fish-Processing-Protocol.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=xEjnTF"">LSW Fish Processing Protocol</a>. This will be comprised of a remote underwater video (RUV) assessment and a transect snorkel video assessment at each treatment site.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Study sites&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Three study sites (HE1 &ndash; HE3) along Riverside Road under the ToEF local government authority form the initial locations for this research outlined in parts 1-3. The three sites are further divided and each includes three treatment types:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x stretch (~30 m) of rock revetment (Rr1 &ndash; Rr3)</li>
<li>1 x stretch (~30 m) of seawall (Sw1 &ndash; Sw3) that will remain unmodified</li>
<li>1 x stretch (~30 m) of seawall that will be modified with habitat panels (Mw1-Mw3)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 1 Approach: Comparison of revetment to the unmodified seawall</strong></p>
<p>Here, the following two treatments: limestone rock revetment (Rr1 &ndash; Rr3) and limestone river walls (Sw1 &ndash; Sw3) will be used to assess the differences in macro species richness and functional diversity. At each site (HE1 -HE3), the central 10 m stretch of both treatment types will be assessed using a randomly placed 25 cm x 25 cm quadrat to count macro species richness and percentage cover. Ten replicate quadrats will be assessed at three tidal heights (low, medium, and high tide heights) equating to 30 quadrats in total within each stretch of treatment. Macro species richness will be collected by recording each of the mobile and sessile species that fall within each of the 25 individual quadrants. Macro percentage cover will be collected by recording the dominant sessile species that fall under each of the 25 intersecting points of each quadrat. Any mobile species that fall within the 25 individual quadrants will also be recorded.</p>
<p>The RUV assessments will be used across each treatment at each site to quantify differences in fish assemblages. To complete these assessments, three GoPro cameras will be haphazardly placed along the same central 10 m stretch from the quadrat sampling. Cameras will be situated facing the treatment at approximately 70 cm distance from the wall/rock revetment. They will be set to record video footage for 40 minutes each. The first and last 5 minutes will be trimmed from each video to remove any influence of the operator when setting the cameras in place. This will result in three thirty-minute videos being recorded for each treatment per site. Each video will be used to quantify species diversity, counts and behaviour using the analytical software EventMeasure.</p>
<p>To document broader species diversity, primarily of fish, a snorkel transect will be used. An operator carrying a GoPro will slowly swim the entire length of each treatment at each site at a distance of approximately 1.5m from each treatment and a speed of 3 m/min. The videos will be analysed in EventMeasure to document fish species diversity, abundance and size that are more broadly associated with each treatment.</p>
<p>The assessment of comparing habitat growth on revetment and unmodified seawalls will occur twice, once at the start of the project and once at the end to determine differences in diversity between the two treatments.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of the methodology for this part of the project is detailed in the <a href=""https://dpaw.sharepoint.com/teams/RiversandEstuariesScience/Habitat%20Enhancement/4.%20Projects/1.%20Living%20Seawalls/1.%20East%20Fremantle/Habitat%20panel%20assessment%20plan.docx?d=w62520ab59c8e48cfad14f5b77ea239cf&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=38faU6"">Habitat Panel Assessment Plan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>
<p>The methodology for the data collection of the quadrats will apply to all parts and will include the following:</p>
<p>Land-based assessment of quadrats to determine percentage cover and diversity species per quadrat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the primary and secondary sessile species at each intersecting point. If the intersecting point lands on a mobile species count the substrate underneath (i.e. bare substrate).</li>
<li>Record the presence of other sessile species that are present within each plot.</li>
<li>Count the number of mobile species to the lowest taxonomic resolution within each quadrat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data will be transcribed using the <a href=""https://dpaw.sharepoint.com/teams/RiversandEstuariesScience/Habitat%20Enhancement/4.%20Projects/1.%20Living%20Seawalls/1.%20East%20Fremantle/4.%20Field%20survey%20forms%20and%20templates/1.%20Archive/Example%20template%20-%20Habitat%20enhancement%20quadrat%20field%20input1.xlsm?d=waaa6281ddee64fd984666b118301a712&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=oTM2YB"">Macro quadrat field input file on the field</a> Getac computers.</p>
<p><strong>Underwater video (note: this methodology will apply to parts 1 and 2)</strong></p>
<p>Multiple types of data will be recorded during the RUV survey including diversity abundance, habitat use and behaviour. Abundance will be measured with MaxN, habitat use will be measured through observations and the behaviour will be measured following the hierarchy of multiple behaviours. These variables will be recorded if a fish appears within the frame of the video and is tagged.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Tagging the fish &ndash; each video will be paused at the time a fish enters the view. Click on the fish and enter the species, number, part, activity and comment (see <a href=""https://dpaw.sharepoint.com/teams/RiversandEstuariesScience/Habitat%20Enhancement/4.%20Projects/1.%20Living%20Seawalls/1.%20East%20Fremantle/3.%20Protocols%20and%20specifications/LivingSeawalls%20Fish-Processing-Protocol.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=lyI3ja"">protocol</a> for detailed instructions).</li>
<li>MaxN &ndash; is the conservative measure of abundance and measures the number of individuals from a species in a single frame.</li>
<li>Observations &ndash; is the measure of habitat use and quantifies the number of times a species enters a frame rather than the number of fish within a frame at any given time. The observation data type follows three rules detailed within the protocol.</li>
<li>Behaviour &ndash; is the measure of the behaviour of each tagged species. This categorises the behaviour of a species into five different parameters. And where multiple behaviours are displayed, one is recorded based on the hierarchy of behaviours detailed in the protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>The transect snorkel assessment video data will be used to analyse fish diversity within the local vicinity of the modified seawall. The data collected will include diversity, abundance and general size class.</p>
<p><strong>Wave climate (note: this methodology will apply to parts 1 and 2)</strong></p>
<p>This data will be analysed to look at wave frequency and intensity to derive a metric of exposure at each site throughout the trial.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The RBR <em>Solo</em><em><sup>3</sup></em><em>D</em> will be running continuously throughout each of the parts.</li>
<li>The loggers will be downloaded every 4 weeks when the batteries are replaced.</li>
<li>Data will initially be downloaded using the RBR software. This software can analyse the data however it also produces a CSV file of the raw data for complete control. MatLab mfiles and R scripts can be used to further interrogate data if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sampling frequency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 x initial assessment with a review at the end of the project.</li>
<li>Battery replacement and wave logger download every 4 &ndash; 6 weeks depending on availability and survey frequency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2 Approach: Comparison of modified and unmodified river walls</strong></p>
<p>Here, the following two treatments: modified limestone river walls (Ms1 &ndash; Ms3) and unmodified limestone river walls (Sw1 &ndash; Sw3) will be used to test the hypotheses. The modified river wall sites will consist of 50 panels that are in an interlocking repetitive pattern of the five different panel structure types (control &ndash; flat panel, ridges, honeycomb, swim-through &amp; large rockpools). The macro sampling effort of the panels and the unmodified river wall will follow the same methodology outlined in Part 1.</p>
<p>Wave climate data will be recorded using RBR <em>Solo<sup>3</sup>D </em>wave loggers. These will be deployed at each site at a depth of approximately 1.5 m. The loggers will be fixed to a concrete block to keep them in place. They will be downloaded and serviced every month to avoid data loss. This servicing will be carried out by two operators snorkelling from a boat.</p>
<p>Tidal height in the form of saturation curve data will also be obtained to investigate how long each panel spends submerged during each tidal cycle.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of the methodology for this part is detailed within the <a href=""https://dpaw.sharepoint.com/teams/RiversandEstuariesScience/Habitat%20Enhancement/4.%20Projects/1.%20Living%20Seawalls/1.%20East%20Fremantle/Habitat%20panel%20assessment%20plan.docx?d=w62520ab59c8e48cfad14f5b77ea239cf&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=38faU6"">Habitat Panel Assessment Plan</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Quadrat assessment</strong></p>
<p>The same macro quadrat assessment methodology outlined in Part 1 will be used here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Species Identification</strong></p>
<p>The same species identification methodology outlined in Part 1 will be used here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same wave loggers will be used across the duration of Parts 1-3. The download of the loggers will occur on a 4 &ndash; 6 weekly basis coinciding with the surveys if possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sampling frequency</strong></p>
<p>Except for the baseline survey sample events (Part 2 only), Parts 2 and 3 will align with the following sampling frequency:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 x monthly baseline sample events between August and October 2022 before panel installation.</li>
<li>1 x time zero sample event (November 2022 with two weeks of panel installation)</li>
<li>1 x 3 monthly sample events (commencing January 2023)</li>
<li>6 x 6 monthly sample events commencing in April 2023 sampling effort and will continue to the end of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 3 Approach: Locations in Australia and globally</strong></p>
<p>Here the research focus is just on the habitat panels. The habitat panel methodologies outlined in Parts 1 and 2 will be used, in conjunction with micro quadrat species assessments.</p>
<p>Three randomly selected panels for each of the five different panel designs (15 panels in total) will be assessed per site, per survey. Each panel will be analysed using a macro quadrat (the same 25 cm x 25 cm with 25 intersecting points as used in Parts 1 and 2) along with two micro quadrats (4cm x 4cm with 9 intersecting points). The placement of the quadrats will differ from Part 2. The macro quadrat will be placed squarely onto the centre of the panel, not randomly placed. The micro quadrats will be haphazardly placed with one on the external surface of the panel feature and the other on the internal surface, for example, the crest and trough of the ridges panel. The quadrats will be analysed using a similar method to Parts 1 and 2 whereby dominant sessile species will be used to calculate percentage cover, and additional sessile and mobile species will be used to provide insight into overall abundance. The count of mobile species will be recorded.</p>
<p>A more detailed description of the methodology for this part is detailed within the <a href=""https://dpaw.sharepoint.com/teams/RiversandEstuariesScience/Habitat%20Enhancement/4.%20Projects/1.%20Living%20Seawalls/1.%20East%20Fremantle/Habitat%20panel%20assessment%20plan.docx?d=w62520ab59c8e48cfad14f5b77ea239cf&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=38faU6"">Habitat Panel Assessment Plan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Data collection</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quadrat assessment</strong></p>
<p>The same macro quadrat assessment methodology as Parts 1 and 2 will be used within Part 3 for the macro quadrat assessment. The micro quadrat assessment for Part 3 will follow a similar methodology however will assess the external and internal features of a panel using 9 intersecting points rather than 25. The placement of each of the quadrats will also differ slightly from Parts 1 and 2 as the macro quadrat will be placed squarely on the centre of each panel rather than haphazardly at different tidal heights.</p>
<p><strong>Species Identification</strong></p>
<p>The same species identification methodology outlined in Parts 1 and 2 will be used here.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sampling frequency</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sampling frequency for Part 3 will run simultaneously with Part 2 and follow the same sampling frequency detailed above.</p>
<p><strong>Data management and processing</strong></p>
<p>During sampling efforts, data will be recorded in Excel and saved on external hard drives and cloud services (i.e. DBCA Sharepoint). After each sampling effort, the results collected from the quadrant sampling in parts 1-3 will be analysed using R Statistical Programming (ref). Overall species diversity, percentage cover and the number of unique taxa (sessile and mobile) will be assessed. In addition to comparing these results, generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) or boosted regression trees (BRTs) will be used to determine what factors (e.g. tidal height of panels, time of year) are influencing the species richness and diversity previously analysed in R. All results will be collated to form publication worthy figures and tables.</p>",granted,False,<p>N/A</p>,not required,False,not required,"<p aria-level=""2""><strong>Data Analysis</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the trial, the effectiveness of Part 2 will be statistically analysed and detailed in the final research report. These findings will also be used in any scientific publication that may be produced. This analysis will be performed under the guidance of the Department&rsquo;s biometrician Matthew Williams. Following an initial consultation, it has been recommended that the data for this part will be assessed simultaneously and will loosely follow the analysis used by Strain <em>et al</em>. 2017. The analysis will use BACI (Before-After x Control-Impact) analysis to assess the success of each treatment. This will be achieved by using mixed-effect ANOVAs to test for significance in diversity in relation to the site, treatment type and tidal height. Due to the nature of this trial, a test for distribution will likely return an overdispersion from the Poisson distribution, in which case this family will be used when fitting GAMMs (negative binomial model) to the data when testing for variability.&nbsp; These analyses may also include the nested covariates; exposure, complexity and saturation times.&nbsp;In addition to GAMMs, boosted regression trees (BRTs) may be used (Elith <em>et al</em>. 2008). BRTs are statistical learning techniques that use a combination of regression trees and boosting to fit numerous individual trees in a forward stage-wise method. These models incorporate different types of predictor variables (i.e. quantitative and qualitative) to fit additive regression models giving insights into ecological variables (Elith <em>et al.</em> 2008). Unlike GAMMs, BRTs can automatically handle interaction effects between predictors and can fit complex nonlinear relationships. These models may be used as an alternative to GAMMs during this project.</p>
<p>To further investigate if there is a significance in species diversity a PERMANOVA will be performed to understand any association between species composition, site, treatment and tidal height.</p>
<p>Data analysis from fish assemblage assessments will be analysed using a similar approach. Analyses will be performed frequently to visualise species composition, abundance and behaviour over time that may be used in progress updates and milestone reporting to stakeholders. At the end of the trial, the data from this assessment will be statistically analysed using BACI analysis like that detailed above. The analysis will follow the guidance of published literature and consultation with the Department&rsquo;s biometrician will be sought at each stage of analysis to determine the most suitable approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complementary data collected alongside this trial such as the wave climate data, panel complexity (surface area) and saturation curve data will be assessed annually to visualise variation over time. At the end of the trial, these data will be further explored to investigate the influence on species richness using the most appropriate statistical analysis. Guidance from peer-reviewed literature and the Department&rsquo;s biometrician will be sought at this stage.</p>

<p>This part of the trial will be assessed using inference from change over space approach. This will be achieved by using multivariate and univariate PERMANOVA to test the effects of panel design complexity (using the surface area as a proxy) and site on biodiversity. Similarly, to Bishop <em>et al</em>., 2022, the multivariate analyses can use Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices on untransformed matrices of each of the sessile species percentage cover and mobile species abundances. Univariate analyses will use Euclidean distances on species richness (for sessile and mobile species both combined and independently), the total cover of fouling species, the total abundance of mobile species and the key functional groups of habitat-forming species.</p>
<p>Temporal panel-scale effects of complexity will be assessed using three-way analyses using design (fixed), time (fixed) and panel identity (random but nested in panel design). These analyses can be run on the same multivariate and univariate metrics detailed above except for the functional groups which will be on an annual scale.</p>

829,<p>This project is part of the Dirk Hartog ecological restoration and fauna reconstruction plan (Gillen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Morris <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>,"<p>Dirk Hartog Island was established as a national park on 29 October 2009 and this provided the opportunity to restore the island&rsquo;s natural environment and reconstruct its native vertebrate fauna. The island formerly supported at least 13 species of mammal of which only three still persisted following introduction of feral cats, mice and goats and over 100 years of pastoral use (Gillen <em>et al</em>. 2011; Morris <em>et al</em>. 2016).</p>
<p>The island also supports three threatened bird subspecies (Dirk Hartog Island Southern Emu-wren, Dirk Hartog Island White-winged Fairy-wren and Dirk Hartog Island Rufous Fieldwren), while another, the Dirk Hartog Island Western Grasswren, became extinct during the last century (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 2013). However, despite the fact that the three threatened bird taxa were known to be endemic to Dirk Hartog Island, virtually nothing was known of their distribution on the island, habitat preferences, or abundance. In addition, the taxonomic status of the fieldwren was unclear - while some authors considered the island population to be an endemic subspecies (e.g. Schodde and Mason 1999), others (e.g. Johnstone and Storr 2004) hypothesised that variation in this species in Western Australia was clinal, and no subspecies should be recognised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;There has therefore been a clear need to clarify the taxonomic and conservation status of the fieldwren, to characterise the ecological requirements of the endemic taxa, and to determine their population sizes, in order to provide baseline data against which outcomes of future management actions can be evaluated.</p>","<p>(a) clarification of the taxonomic status of the Dirk Hartog Island Fieldwren</p>

2158,,"<p>Urbanisation leads to many direct and indirect impacts in natural remnants, including eutrophication, frequent disturbance, loss of connectivity, loss of key faunal elements and their ecological functions, additional heat island stress, climate and groundwater change. In many urban and peri-urban bushland reserves, changed fire regime and weed invasion, compound these threats and each other, but are potentially the easiest to manage. Invasive grasses, in particular change fuel dynamics (accumulation, structure, connectivity, availability), and their spread and cover is enhanced by fire. Clearly the stakes are high here too, with their high exposure, both the fire risk to neighbors and visitors and the biodiversity and community values of these remnant reserves are acute. As invasive grasses are ubiquitous in urban bushlands, burning to manage fuels, without weed management, might lead to perverse outcomes for both biodiversity and fire hazard. This long-term study examines the impacts of different proposed or actual bushland management approaches on fire risk, biodiversity conservation and weed invasion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this study we compare the abundance and cover of native and non-native plant species, vegetation structure, and the distribution and abundance of fuels with both pre-treatment baselines, and across treatments and controls. The maximal design includes six treatments, with three burn treatments &ndash; fire exclusion, and &lsquo;medium&rsquo; and &lsquo;short&rsquo; rotations (~12-14 and 6-8 years) &shy;&ndash; each crossed by the presence and absence of standard weed management approaches. With the time component of these treatments, the study is inherently long-term, and likely site, burn treatment and year differences require increasing replication. The program commenced with pre-burn survey in spring 2014 for a burn implemented in autumn 2015 in Kings Park, follow-up monitoring of this site and similar work for sites burned in Bold Park, Jandakot Regional Park and Beeliar Regional Park (Yangebup) continuing.

","The broad goal of this project is to prioritize island management actions so that we maximize the number of achievable conservation outcomes for island biodiversity in the face of threats from invasive species. Western Australia has over 3,700 islands, many of which are essential for the survival of threatened species and provide critical breeding sites for seabirds and sea turtles. In some cases, islands support the last remaining populations of plant and animal species making their long term protection highly desirable. Many of Western Australia’s islands are also popular sites for recreation, and tourism, and contain many culturally significant sites. Invasive species are the single biggest cause of loss of native species from islands across the globe. The increased use of islands by the public for recreation, and oil, gas and mining industries means an increased likelihood that invasive species will colonize pristine islands.   
Prioritization of management investments is essential because funds for turning national, state or regional conservation goals into actions are typically limited. Implementation of actions therefore generally proceeds incrementally while biodiversity continues to decline, even in areas earmarked for future management. Funds to manage established protected areas are also insufficient, so these areas too can be expected to suffer declines in biodiversity. Reversing these declines presents researchers and managers with difficult challenges.   
In the past prioritizing conservation actions has relied on the experience and expertise of conservation land managers. The field of Strategic Conservation Planning is an organized field of research that attempts to design explicit frameworks and models for guiding conservation actions that generate cost-effective and accountable recommendations for prioritizing actions. Four specific and relatively independent areas of research have generated models and knowledge relevant to the problem of prioritizing conservation actions.   
The first area of research on prioritizing or scheduling conservation investments (Pressey et al. 2004) has modeled conservation and loss of biodiversity from an area through design of variable conservation networks given spatial variability in conservation and use values (Spring et al. 2010, Visconti et al. 2010). These models do not consider the multiple threats to biodiversity or multiple actions managers may implement to mitigate biodiversity loss. The second area has ranked lists of possible actions for species management in a single area, recognizing the costs, benefits and probability of success associated with each action (Bottrill et al. 2008, Joseph et al. 2008a, Joseph et al. 2008b). Action are treated independently and prioritized according to their marginal contributions to conservation goals, with the final list of high priority projects being limited by available funds (Weitzman 1998). However, actions are rarely implemented independently, so optimal search algorithms should instead identify combinations of actions that optimize costs, benefits, probability of success and budget constraints (Westphal and Possingham 2003). A third research area has allocated different conservation actions to regions globally or across continents (Wilson et al. 2006, Wilson et al. 2007, Bode et al. 2008, Underwood et al. 2008). These studies ignored almost all spatial variation in intensity of threats, costs of actions, and responses of species and other features to management interventions. A fourth area of research allocates actions spatially using a global search algorithm (Watts et al. 2009, Klein et al. 2010, Wilson et al. 2010), but matches only one action with each area and ignore the temporal variation of threats as they respond to management or environmental variables. These studies also did not deal with uncertainty.   
This project will combine these four areas of research into a single comprehensive formulation that will create a decision support tool for day-to-day use in making accountable and cost-effective decisions about where to spend limited funding on management of islands. The need for this project is underlined by the limitations of the four research areas described above, all of which have limited applicability to field managers faced with immediate, real-world problems. This project fills a crucial need. The project will be developed collaboratively with practitioners to ensure that: 1. the science is properly grounded so that it provides answers useful to day-to-day management; and 2. decisions are based on the best available expert judgment where hard data are lacking.  
  

","<p>This aim of this project will be to develop a decision support tool for day-to-day use in making accountable and cost-effective decisions about where to spend limited funding on management of islands to promote the persistence of native species. The decision support tool will assist in prioritizing WA islands for conservation surveillance and management and could contribute to a future biosecurity plans for other islands both in Western Australia and across Australia. The project will initially focus on the islands along the Pilbara coast between Exmouth Gulf and Eighty Mile Beach. The decision support tool will eventually be applied to the management all of Western Australia’s islands, and potentially to all Australian islands.</p>","<p>This project will generate several beneficial products for island conservation in Western Australia including: 1) An operational decision support tool for island management with the aim of promoting the persistence of native species on islands.  2) Training sessions to develop the capacity of DEC staff to apply the model in managing the conservation estate. DEC officers will also be able to update the decision support tool as new data become available, and will remain in contact with the research group at James Cook University, ensuring that access to improved versions of the software tool are obtainable. An MOU will be established between DEC and James Cook University to ensure ongoing collaboration. 3) Accountable and cost effective decisions that aid the conservation of WA’s idyllic islands and native species. 4) A single comprehensive database on Western Australian island characteristics, fauna, flora, and threats and; 5) the project has the support of the Conservation Commission and will address several recommendations in the Commission’s two Status Performance Assessments on Biodiversity Conservation on Western Australian Islands.  </p>
<p>In developing and testing the full decision model, the project team will also create three scientific innovations. First, the method will integrate, for the first time, components of four disparate areas of research, refining each component and developing new links between them. Second, essential to addressing real-world complexity, the project will develop three new sub-models to account for the temporal and spatial dynamics of threats from invasive species, varying contributions of different management actions to management goals, and the costs of actions. Each sub-model will be an important conceptual and technical advance in its own right and will interact with the others to adjust, for example, the choice and sequence of management actions as threats to biodiversity are ameliorated. Third, the project will deal explicitly with uncertainties in key parameters, using plausible bounds and, where possible, probability distributions of abundances and extent of species and ecosystems, distributions of threats and species-specific responses, and contributions and costs of management actions  </p>","<p>The purpose of this project is to develop a decision support tool that will help managers make day-to-day decisions regarding island management. Conservation and resource managers are the anticipated users of the knowledge generated by this project. DEC, as an active partner in the project, will directly absorb the improved data on island biota and management, apply the decision support tool to conservation problems, and enhance its technical capacity to prioritize management actions for the conservation of native species on islands.<br />

Ecological Applications 20:1721-1732.</p>","<p>The islands of Western Australia are a perfect study system for this project, with native species of global and national significance, interacting pressures on these species from invasive plants and animals, alternative management actions with uncertain effectiveness, and insufficient management funds to achieve all goals. This project will focus on the islands along the Pilbara coast between the Exmouth Gulf and Eighty Mile Beach. A workshop held within the first four months of this project will identify the particular islands to be used during model development. The final decision support model generated by the project will be applicable to all WA islands.   </p>
<p>The process of designing this decision support tool has 11 components (Figure 1), which have been adapted from the stages of systematic conservation planning (Pressey and Bottrill 2009) and informed by previous work on prioritizing management actions. Details of each model component are outlined below.</p>
<p>1. Guiding principles (Tear et al. 2005)  shape decisions about species to be managed. The guiding principles will draw on national and state conservation policy and strategies and the expertise of island managers in Western Australia and elsewhere (e.g. managers from the Pilbara region).  </p>
<p>2. A basic requirement for the project will be accurate data on the occurrence, abundance and, population trends of native species on the islands. These data will be compiled from field work, scientific literature and unpublished information held by DEC.  </p>
<p>3. Species weightings will guide solutions in the event (typically) that not all goals can be achieved (Polasky et al. 2008). One of the realities of management within budget constraints is that hard choices will be necessary about, for example, which native species should benefit from management intervention in a given period. While a common currency for comparing species is still hotly debated, and not part of this proposal, the project will require explicit choices and rationale for these inevitable decisions.  </p>
<p>4. Threat models will help to define quantitative goals for each species (Pressey et al. 2003) and estimate potential losses of species in the absence of management. Understanding the potential spread of invasives, within and between islands and from outside sources, in the absence of intervention is necessary to formulate goals and identify priorities. Quantitative conservation goals will probably be larger for more highly threatened species, for example; and priorities will reflect expected declines in native species, and the options for achieving goals on the islands being studied. The threat sub-model (Figure 1) will consider temporally explicit (annual) changes and the potential effects of climate change. Year-zero of the threat sub-model will assume no management intervention, whereas subsequent years will consider management actions. The threat sub-model will also predict species-specific responses to threats, ranging from categorisation of threat status to estimates of population trends and stage-based demographic models (Bolten et al. 2011).  </p>
<p>5. Quantitative management goals are at the core of emerging systematic methods for identifying priorities for investment. They allow managers to be explicit about what they intend to achieve over defined periods, allow progress to be tracked, and facilitate the use of the cutting-edge analytical techniques that will be applied in this project. The project team will define time-bound conservation goals for protection (prevention of decline) and/or restoration (Didier et al. 2009). Goals will recognise the need for complementary management in adjacent marine or terrestrial environments (Dryden et al. 2008).  </p>
<p>6. Areas will be the candidate spatial units assessed for actions (Pressey and Logan 1998). These might be small islands or parts of islands defined as having relatively uniform management requirements. In the Pilbara each island (defined as land not connected to other land masses at low tide) will be considered an independent area.  </p>
<p>7. Actions (Table 1) used to reduce or prevent the arrival of invasive species, will be assigned relative contributions toward each management goal (Edwards et al. 2010). Actions will include biosecurity measures as well as methods to eradicate populations of invasive species in situ. These could be expressed, for example, as the expected reduction in density of an invasive species per hectare of treatment in a given period. The sub-model for relative contributions of actions to goals (Figure 1) will recognise spatial variation in contributions, including probability of success, and synergies and interferences between actions. Actions may vary among targeted invasive species.<br />
8. Management actions will be costed per hectare of treatment (Wilson et al. 2007). The cost sub-model (Figure 1) will address spatial interactions (e.g. travel times) and temporal dynamics of costs in relation to the cost-efficiencies of both early intervention and follow-up work to avoid returns to pre-treatment conditions.<br />
9. There will be two formulations of the problem. The first, and most applicable, will maximise the achievement of goals within cost constraints (Church et al. 1996). The second will find the minimum cost required to achieve all goals.<br />
10.  Application will produce a decision-support tool for managers, allowing them to alter any of the parameters from the previous steps and identify cost-effective options for management of islands. This will involve new coding, linked interactively to a graphical user interface, and identifying multiple cost-effective solutions. Application will also explore alternative funding scenarios, such as the benefits of a biosecurity strategy (Nias et al. 2010) vs. ameliorative management after arrival of invasives, implications of funding cuts or increases on control of invasive species, and effects on overall cost-effectiveness of committing funds to particular island groups or iconic species. The application phase of the project will also explore uncertainties in key parameters as a basis for sensitivity analysis and guiding risk-averse and risk-seeking decisions (Halpern et al. 2006).  </p>",required,False,<p>None.</p>,not required,False,not required,"<p>24.

<p>SP 2016-072&nbsp;Threatened animal recovery through feral cat control in Western Australia - South coast component</p>
<p>SP 2016-068&nbsp;South West Threatened Fauna Recovery Project: Southern Jarrah Forest</p>","<p>Over the last 200 years, 50 per cent of the world&rsquo;s mammal extinctions have occurred in Australia (Short and Smith 1994). In Western Australia alone, 12 mammals and two birds have become extinct and at 30 June 2015, 39 terrestrial mammals and 23 terrestrial birds native to the State were classified as being threatened with extinction. Of these, three mammals and two birds are ranked as critically endangered. In mammals, most extinctions and declines have occurred in medium size species, in the so called &lsquo;critical weight range&rsquo; of 35g to 5500g (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989).</p>
<p>Predation by feral cats and foxes is a key threatening process in the decline of many, if not all, these species. Foxes have been successfully controlled for many years in a range of locations across Western Australia using dried meat sausage baits containing 1080 poison. Over a decade of research by Parks and Wildlife scientists has led to the development of the <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> feral cat bait, a moister meat bait, also containing 1080, that is more palatable to feral cats. <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> was registered for operational use in Western Australia in December 2014, providing the opportunity to integrate broadscale feral cat control with existing fox baiting programs and other actions, such as translocation, that are implemented to improve the recovery of threatened native animals.</p>
<p>On 16 July 2015, the Minister for Environment, Hon Albert Jacob MLA, and the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Hon Greg Hunt MP, announced $1.7 million in funding for the Department of Parks and Wildlife to assist threatened animal recovery. The funding will be used to integrate the new <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> feral cat bait with current fox baiting in four different Western Australian environments. Sites have been specifically selected to direct the funding to improving conservation of species identified in the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Threatened Species Strategy, and to align with fauna recovery programs already underway or planned by Parks and Wildlife in the south-west of WA.</p>
<p>This project fits within a broader suite of actions delivered by Parks and Wildlife to reduce the impacts of feral cats and foxes on threatened species in Western Australia. This includes <em>Western Shield</em>, the Integrated Fauna Recovery Project on the south coast, Rangelands Restoration at Matuwa and many other smaller scale projects.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the project is to contribute to the recovery of key threatened mammal and bird species found at each of these sites, through integrating feral cat baiting with existing fox baiting to reduce the impact of introduced predators, and undertaking translocations to establish new, secure populations, where necessary.</p>
<p>While the <em>Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup></em> feral cat bait is a key tool in achieving effective feral cat control, other methods, such as shooting and/or trapping, may also be employed. For example, some individual cats appear to be reluctant to take baits or local climatic conditions may reduce the effectiveness of baiting alone.&nbsp; Some flexibility is built into the project plan to allow this suite of control options to be employed, as necessary.</p>
<p>The project is funded for three years over the 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 financial years. A project agreement has been signed with the Commonwealth Government outlining funding to be provided in each financial year and key deliverables.</p>
<p>Four key areas are targeted under the broader project: Kalbarri NP, South Coast region, Upper Warren region and Dryandra Woodland.&nbsp; This proposal relates to the Kalbarri NP component.</p>
<p>Kalbarri National Park covers an area of 183,000ha and straddles the lower reaches of the Murchison River.&nbsp; The park supports a range of threatened fauna including malleefowl, chuditch and a small population of black-flanked rock wallabies (BFRW) (re-discovered in 2015, thought extinct since mid 1990s). The primary objective of this project is to recover a wild population of BFRW in Kalbarri NP, through effective integration of feral cat control with existing fox control, successful translocation of rock-wallabies and effective neighbor engagement.&nbsp; Two translocations are proposed to supplement the current population and establish further populations. Integration of the Eradicat feral cat bait with existing fox baiting will be initiated in Kalbarri NP in 2016.&nbsp; Monitoring of foxes and feral cats to assess the effectiveness of feral cat and fox baiting will be undertaken.</p>","<p>To recover a wild population of black-flanked rock-wallabies in Kalbarri National Park, through:</p>

<p><u>Sampling sites:</u> Kalbarri National Park (baited site), Murchison House Station and unallocated crown land to the north of KNP (Number: 1012103).</p>
<p><u>Sampling method</u>: Camera monitoring will be the primary method used to monitor predators throughout the park.&nbsp; Cameras will remain in place for the life of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera set up &ndash; cameras will be placed horizontally at a height of 30-40cm on pickets, facing south.&nbsp; Vegetation will be cleared to ground level in front of cameras to a maximum area of 3m, where necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Sampling design</u>: a minimum of 65 cameras will be used in total across KNP and the unbaited reference site.&nbsp; Approximately 50 cameras will be set in KNP and 15 cameras will be set in the unbaited area (smaller area).&nbsp; Camera placement across KNP and the unbaited reference area will be determined using a constrained, randomised model to allocate camera positions.&nbsp; Camera placement is constrained to tracks and randomised with a minimum distance of 3km between placement points. In areas where there is a risk of camera theft, the camera will be moved off, but close to the track, and set up in a cleared area.</p>
<p>In the south two cameras will be installed either side of the track at each monitoring point to improve detectability across the wider tracks.&nbsp; In the north, one camera will be placed at each monitoring point.&nbsp; Cameras will be placed perpendicular (or at a slight 5-10<sup>o</sup> angle) to the track.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameras will be passive (non-lured).&nbsp; Detection rates will be assessed before the Eradicat baiting to check that the detections are sufficient to indicate a change in the system.&nbsp; If not, consideration will be given to increasing the number of cameras across the study site or using lures with cameras (visual and olfactory lures).&nbsp; &nbsp;If lures are used they would be installed at each monitoring point 2-4 weeks prior to the Eradicat baiting; would be removed during the baiting round and then replaced two weeks post baiting for a period of 2-4 weeks.</p>
<p>Cameras will remain in place (subject to fire) for the entirety of the project.&nbsp; Cameras will be checked, on average, every 3-4 months, dependent on battery life and SD card use.</p>
<p>Camera monitoring of predators will only be carried out on the &lsquo;flats&rsquo; &ndash; no specific predator monitoring will be done in the gorge due to the difficulty of installing and servicing cameras and the increased risk of injury to staff.&nbsp; Foxes and feral cats may be picked up on the cameras set up to monitor the BFRWs (40 cameras across Four Ways and Promenade).</p>
<p><u>Data capture and analysis</u>:&nbsp; Images for predator monitoring will be processed every 3-4 months using FastStone Image viewer and CPW Photo Warehouse.&nbsp; Where possible, feral cats and foxes will be individually identified to try to identify the geographic range over which individuals are detected.&nbsp; Data summaries will be produced every six months; including species detected, activity index, heat maps and cumulative sum control charts. Occupancy modelling will be carried out post Eradicat baiting to determine the impact of the baiting on feral cats and foxes.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking</strong></p>
<p>GPS tracking of foxes and feral cats: In 2016/17 up to ten cats and foxes will be trapped on the flats near the gorge and fitted with GPS collars.&nbsp; The intention is to get some information on how predators use the gorge system so we can better understand the threats to the BFRW and chuditch populations.&nbsp; Collars have a mortality signal so we will also be able to identify whether feral cats and foxes are killed through the&nbsp; Eradicat baiting.&nbsp; Five GPS fixes will be taken at each of the peak activity times (sunrise and sunset) and one fix will also be taken at midday to provide an indication of likely den/resting areas.&nbsp; Collars will be fitted to foxes and feral cats 3-4 months prior to aerial baiting (dependent on collar battery life).&nbsp; GPS information from collars &ndash; a qualitative assessment of land use area (gorge vs flats) will be determined from location information.&nbsp; Indicative home ranges will be determined using kernel density estimates.&nbsp; Percent of feral cats alive post-baiting will provide information to calibrate camera data and indicate effectiveness of Eradicat baiting.</p>
<p><u>Intended outcomes</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved timing and location of Eradicat baiting.</li>
<li>Foxes and feral cat abundance will be reduced.</li>
<li>Recovery of threatened species will be improved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>b) Monitoring Rock Wallabies </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Source populations</strong></li>
<li><strong>In situ Kalbarri population (Promenade)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Translocated population (Four Ways; possibly Hawks Head) &ndash; </strong>approved translocation proposal attached.</li>
</ol>
<p>Detail on the BFRW monitoring is provided in the translocation plan, a summary is provided below (see appendix 3 (separate document)).</p>
<p>Source Populations:&nbsp; Mt Caroline and Nangeen Hill BFRW populations will be used as the source populations in year one of translocation and possibly year two.&nbsp; Consideration may be given to sourcing animals from Pilbara and Cape Range populations in year two or year three depending on logistics, discussions with traditional owners and consideration of broadening genetic diversity of the founder population.</p>
<p>2016 monitoring of Mt Caroline and Nangeen:&nbsp; Intensive trapping (using Thomas traps) was undertaken in March and April/May 2016 at Mt Caroline and Nangeen &ndash; the population was trapped for up to 14 days until the number of recaptures indicated that most of the population had been trapped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trapping data was analysed to determine number of founder animals that could be removed from each site (up to 23 in total for year one of the translocation); sex ratios of source populations, number of females with pouch young, age structure and an indication of health (weight, body condition).</p>
<p>Subsequent to the removal of founder animals, source sites will be monitored again in early 2017 and 2018 to ensure that the population hasn&rsquo;t been negatively impacted by the translocation. An assessment of number of females with young, sex ratio and age structure should indicate if the populations have been impacted negatively in the short term and the implications for the longer term.&nbsp; If it is determined that the source populations cannot sustain further removal of animals, animals required for year two of the translocation will be sourced from other Wheatbelt sites or Cape Range/Pilbara populations.</p>
<p>In situ Kalbarri population (Promenade; one male and one female BFRW): cameras have been installed around the Promenade site.&nbsp; Scat searches and camera arrays placed between Promenade and Four Ways will be used to indicate continued presence and possible dispersal of the BFRW.&nbsp; The three female animals that will be translocated in 2016 will be fitted with VHF collars and radio-tracked for 12months.</p>
<p>Translocated population: Animals released in 2016 at Four Ways will be monitored using a combination of techniques.&nbsp; The primary method of monitoring will be using VHF collars and radio-tracking the animals for 12months. &nbsp;In 2016 all translocated animals will be fitted with collars. &nbsp;Radio-tracking will be carried out initially by both aerial and ground tracking (up to three months) and then by ground tracking only.&nbsp; Collars will indicate mortality and location of animals.&nbsp; Cameras placed around the release site will also be used to monitor the presence and breeding status of animals.&nbsp; Cameras will remain in place for 12 months after the translocation (and possibly for the life of the project depending on the quantity and quality of data that the cameras provide relative to other sampling techniques).&nbsp; Sighting the animals will also be carried out every 2-3 months when staff go in to check cameras.</p>
<p>In subsequent translocations a proportion of the founder animals will be fitted with VHF collars and radio-tracked.&nbsp; Depending on the success of the VHF collars in year one, consideration may be given to using GPS collars on some animals.&nbsp; Cameras will also be installed around the Hawks Head release site to monitor animals.</p>
<p><u>Intended outcomes</u>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kalbarri genetic lineage will be retained by producing Wheatbelt-Kalbarri offspring and increasing the number of individuals carrying Kalbarri alleles.</li>
<li>Two subpopulations of BFRW will be established, increasing the number of animals in the Kalbarri population and creating opportunity for dispersal throughout the gorge.</li>
<li>A persistent and resilient population of BFRW in the Midwest region.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposed Site Baiting Prescription</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kalbarri NP </strong></p>
<p>Current baiting prescription: two times aerial fox bait (spring and autumn) + quarterly ground fox baiting of tracks.</p>
<p>Proposed prescription 2016:&nbsp; two aerial fox bait (autumn, spring); one aerial feral cat bait end of winter (northern section of park only).&nbsp; Quarterly ground fox baiting of tracks.</p>
<p>The northern section of the park will be aerially baited with Eradicat in winter 2016 (late August).&nbsp; The southern section of the park will remain unbaited with Eradicat until 2017.&nbsp; In 2017 both the northern and southern sections of the park will be baited in summer or autumn (to be determined).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional baiting around BFRW sites &ndash; Promenade and Four Ways will have additional fox ground baiting before and after the translocation and Eradicat baiting if and when cats are identified near the release sites (through cameras or sighting cat tracks).</p>
<p>Other complementary measures including with neighbours: Encourage trapping, shooting and baiting on neighbouring lands.</p>

The advance of Cane Toads towards Western Australia has caused tremendous concern about their impacts on the native fauna of the Kimberley region. Despite, the presence of this introduced species in Australia since the 1930s, surprisingly little is known about its ecological effects. While Northern Quolls (_Dasyurus hallucatus, _Oakwood 2003), some goannas (Burnett 1997) and a couple of snakes (Phillips, Brown and Shine 2003) are known to be killed by toads; data on impacts on other fauna is either anecdotal or non-existent ( for a review, see [www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened](http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened)). Impacts of cane toads are potentially threefold: competition with native species, predation of native invertebrates/vertebrates and destruction of wildlife due to lethal toxic ingestion.

 

 

CALM has supported the nomination of Cane Toads as a “key threatening process” under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act 1999, noting that “it was a significant threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function.” Most of the limited research conducted in the Northern Territory and Queensland has focused on the impacts of Cane Toads on frogs and those species that might consume toads (e.g. quolls). Vertebrates most at risk would appear to be frogs, frog-eating snakes, goannas and dasyruids. This proposal deals with major reptile, frog and marsupial groups most at risk. Other research is required on turtles, birds and invertebrate groups, especially endemic land snails.

 

 

Research underway in the Northern Territory is examining the impacts of toads on goannas and a range of terrestrial vertebrates in Kakadu National Park (Watson and Woinarski 2003). Unfortunately, sites were only sampled for 1-2 years prior to the arrival of toads, limiting the interpretation of results. However, it was concluded that quolls, goannas (considered as a group), gilbert’s dragons and perhaps elapid snakes had declined. Other research on impacts on goannas and crocodiles (Griffiths, pers. comm.; Doody, pers. comm.) is ongoing. Cane Toads reached Fogg Dam (NT) this wet season allowing observation on the effects on floodplain snakes and some frogs (Shine, University of Sydney, pers. comm.). Toad competition and predation on native invertebrates has received little attention, but is constrained by sampling/ taxonomic problems and seasonal and temporal variation in invertebrate populations. Much of the information available on Cane Toad impacts is anecdotal or based on studies that have lacked sufficient pre-toad data to determine the impact of cane toads relative to other environmental variables such as rainfall or disturbances such as fire. Further, many species have not been studied at all; at present we can only guess the probable impact of cane toads.

 

 

CALM has an opportunity to carry out complimentary and novel research on the impact of cane toads which can be used to plan for the conservation of species including localized control of toads, small scale fencing, translocation of threatened fauna, establishment of captive populations; among other options. The Kimberley region contains many endemic vertebrates as well as species with broader tropical distributions that may be severely affected by Cane Toads. Given the proximity of Cane Toads to the East Kimberley, it is important to establish research projects now, in advance of the potential arrival of cane toads to ensure that adequate data on existing assemblages of terrestrial vertebrates are collected so impacts can be detected.

 

 

Is this approach fatalistic? Should we be putting all our efforts into stopping cane toads and not worrying about research on impacts? Current trapping efforts will not stop toads. If some research work is not undertaken, we will have lost an opportunity to understand their impacts on East Kimberley and other northern fauna. This would severely limit our capacity to understand the susceptible elements of the fauna and so restrict management efforts to prevent populations declines and extinctions.  

 

 

After discussions with a range of colleagues within and beyond CALM, it appears that where we can target our research most usefully is to examine some of those faunal groups either endemic to the Kimberley, largely restricted to Western Australia or not studied in any detail in the N.T. or Queensland. Those vertebrates most likely to be impacted by cane toads (i.e. frogs, large predatory reptiles and dasyurids) are not well sampled by standard survey techniques such as pitfall trapping (Woinarski _et al._ 2004). This project advocates the use of “cafeteria trials” to quickly assess the susceptibility of a range of fauna to cane toad ingestion with radio-telemetry of large individuals where captive trials are unsuitable.

The metamorphs will have their parotid gland removed prior to the test to minimize the chances of death of the test animals. Sydney University has Animal Ethics approval for this work and is able to supply large numbers of cane toad eggs and metamorphs. It would be exceedingly problematic to carry out this work out in WA due to the restrictions and dangers associated with moving cane toads into WA.

1789,<p><em>other SWTFRP projects</em></p>,"<p>Over the last 200 years, 50 per cent of the world&rsquo;s mammal extinctions have occurred in Australia (Short and Smith 1994). In Western Australia alone, 12 mammals and two birds have become extinct and at 30 June 2015, 39 terrestrial mammals and 23 terrestrial birds native to the State were classified as being threatened with extinction. Of these, three mammals and two birds are ranked as critically endangered. In mammals, most extinctions and declines have occurred in medium size species, in the so called &lsquo;critical weight range&rsquo; of 35g to 5500g (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989).</p>
<p>Predation by feral cats and foxes is a key threatening process in the decline of many, if not all, these species. Foxes have been successfully controlled for many years in a range of locations across Western Australia using dried meat sausage baits containing 1080 poison. Over a decade of research by Parks and Wildlife scientists has led to the development of the <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> feral cat bait, a moister meat bait, also containing 1080, that is more palatable to feral cats. <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> was registered for operational use in Western Australia in December 2014, providing the opportunity to integrate broadscale feral cat control with existing fox baiting programs and other actions, such as translocation, that are implemented to improve the recovery of threatened native animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 16 July 2015, the Minister for Environment, Hon Albert Jacob MLA, and the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Hon Greg Hunt MP, announced $1.7 million in funding for the Department of Parks and Wildlife to assist threatened animal recovery. The funding will be used to integrate the new <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> feral cat bait with current fox baiting in four different Western Australian environments. Sites have been specifically selected to direct the funding to improving conservation of species identified in the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Threatened Species Strategy, and to align with fauna recovery programs already underway or planned by Parks and Wildlife in the south-west of WA.</p>
<p>This project fits within a broader suite of actions delivered by Parks and Wildlife to reduce the impacts of feral cats and foxes on threatened species in Western Australia. This includes <em>Western Shield</em>, the Integrated Fauna Recovery Project on the south coast, Rangelands Restoration at Matuwa and many other smaller scale projects.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the project is to contribute to the recovery of key threatened mammal and bird species found at each of these sites, through integrating feral cat baiting with existing fox baiting to reduce the impact of introduced predators, and undertaking translocations to establish new, secure populations, where necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;While the <em>Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup></em> feral cat bait is a key tool in achieving effective feral cat control, other methods, such as shooting and/or trapping, may also be employed. For example, some individual cats appear to be reluctant to take baits or local climatic conditions may reduce the effectiveness of baiting alone. Some flexibility is built into the project plan to allow this suite of control options to be employed, as necessary.</p>
<p>The project is funded for three years over the 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 financial years. A project agreement has been signed with the Commonwealth Government outlining funding to be provided in each financial year and key deliverables.</p>","<p>To sustainably recover the wild populations of woylies and numbats in the Upper Warren region, through:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","<h1>Project summary</h1>
<p>GOAL: To sustainably recover wild populations of woylies and numbats in the Upper Warren region through effective integration of feral cat control with existing fox control.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: Develop an effective cat and fox control program using Eradicat<em><sup>&reg;</sup></em> and Probait baits that reduces the impact of introduced predators sufficiently to support sustainable populations of vulnerable threatened native fauna in the southern jarrah forests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1 &ndash; Optimising Eradicat</strong><em><sup>&reg;</sup></em><strong> baiting protocols </strong></p>
<p><u>Specific objective:</u> Determine when, how and where to deploy Eradicat<em><sup>&reg;</sup></em> baits using the current operational protocols for aerial and ground deployment (Feral Cat Baiting Prescription; Forest and Ecosystem Management Division, 2015) that maximises the number/proportion of cats killed by baits and minimises the potential risks to non-target native species within the southern jarrah forest bioregion.</p>
<p><u>Strategies:</u> i) use bait uptake trials (using remote sensor cameras) and ii) understand the spatial ecology (using GPS collars and radio-telemetry) of a sample of feral cats to identify when, how and where Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits may maximise their impact on cats and minimise their possible risk to non-target native species.</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><strong>Stage 2 &ndash; Operational deployment of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup></strong></p>
<p><u>Specific objectives:</u> Quantify the effects of an optimised operational use of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> &nbsp;baits (informed by stage 1) at the individual and population levels of i) feral cats and foxes, ii) potentially vulnerable non-target native species, and iii) priority native species threatened by introduced predators (Numbats, Woylies, etc) within the Upper Warren region.</p>
<p><u>Strategy:</u> Conduct an Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baiting program within a limited area of the Upper Warren (e.g. 225-400 km<sup>2</sup>), within a comparative / experimental framework, to assess the effectiveness on target species (cats and foxes) and effects on non-target species (with a focus on potentially vulnerable and priority beneficiaries).</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p><strong>Subsequent stages beyond the scope of the current project</strong></p>
<p><u>Stage 3 Objective:</u> Operationally integrate Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> and Probait into the introduced predator control and monitoring program across the Upper Warren region (Western Shield&rsquo;s Manjimup baiting cell).</p>
<p><u>Stage 4 Objective:</u> Consider the merits of rolling out the improved introduced predator control and monitoring program across other forested landscapes in south-western Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Project area</h1>
<p>Stage 1 (optimising baiting protocols) will be conducted in the southern jarrah forest ecosystems managed by Parks and Wildlife (predominantly in the Southern Jarrah Forest (JAF02) IBRA subregion), where standard fox baiting is currently applied and where feral cat control is a priority.</p>
<p>Stages 2 &amp; 3 (larger scale operational baiting trial) will be conducted in the Upper Warren region given that it is a priority area for threatened mammal conservation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Stage 1 - Optimising Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baiting protocols</h1>
<p><u>Proposed program overview:</u></p>
<ol>
<li>a) Pilot trial and method development</li>
<li>b) Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait uptake trials to determine when, how and where the best time to bait is</li>
<li>c) Bait condition trials to determine how the application of Coopex and environmental conditions affect Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait characteristics [dependent on securing additional funds]</li>
<li>d) Spatial ecology of cats to determine where in the landscape to target baiting to maximise the chance of baits being encountered by cats [dependent on securing additional funds]</li>
</ol>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>1a) Pilot trial and method development</h1>
<p>Summary: Technical and methodological trials will be conducted to determine the most effective and efficient protocols for the use of remote sensor cameras (RSC) to detect the consumers of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits deployed in the southern jarrah forest.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the longevity of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits in the southern jarrah forest (i.e. the duration until the bait is consumed/removed to ascertain how long RSCs need to be deployed to capture the consumption of baits during the subsequent bait uptake trials).</li>
<li>Identify the optimal set up of the RSCs to maximize the detection of fauna interacting with the Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait (i.e. by means of a comparison of camera orientations and distances from the bait).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1b) Bait uptake trials</h1>
<p>Summary: Bait uptake trials will be conducted over at least 12-14 months using covert remote sensor cameras to observe species/individuals consuming Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits. This is the preferred method based on affordability, efficiency and return for effort, for directly informing when, how and where it is best to bait for cats and assessing the risk to potential vulnerable non-target species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait trials should resemble operational conditions as closely as possible. E.g. - mimic the spatial pattern of bait deployment by aircraft and ground deployment (Note bait location will not be biased to open areas where cameras can detect animals and observe their interactions with the bait) - bait treatment and characteristics (e.g. sweating, coopex, age, toxicity, etc)</li>
<li>Observer effects should be minimised as much as practically possible E.g. - remote sensor cameras need to be as covert as practically possible - minimise disturbance to sites as much as practically possible (including anthropogenic cues such as smell, etc) - allow enough time for animals to become accustomed to cameras and other infrastructure - minimise the cues for bait deployment (e.g. dummy cameras to be in place for an extended period beforehand so animals do not learn that cameras mean food)</li>
</ol>
<p>Other considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial independence between sites is required to maximise the encounters of different cats and minimise the influence of earlier trials nearby (e.g. removal of cats by toxic baits, opportunities for learning by individuals) that in turn affect inferences, etc (i.e. trials need to be conducted across all or much of the southern jarrah forest).</li>
<li>A balance is needed between having a design that is robust and that will provide adequate and appropriate data that can be used to confidently identify the most effective cat baiting regime in the southern jarrah forests, and having a design that is practical and affordable with the time and resources available.</li>
<li>Trials conducted across larger spatial and temporal scales will provide better results - More replicate sites will provide more data and results that can better account for the variability between sites - Trials over multiple years will more confidently confirm when and under what circumstances baiting is likely to be most effective (but this is not currently planned and may not be practical).</li>
<li>Repeat trials on the same sites should be avoided or minimised. Ideally sites should not be subject to repeat trials more than once every 12 months; to reduce issues associated with the effects of earlier trials influencing the results of subsequent trials (e.g. learning by animals, removal of individuals by toxic baits).</li>
<li>Additional benefits from this project include information on the distribution and activity/occupancy/abundance of mammal fauna (e.g. numbats, quokka, woylies, ngwayir, wambenger, tammar, quenda, chuditch, koomal, western brush wallaby, introduced mammals, etc) in the southern jarrah forest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aerial and ground baiting trials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both aerial and ground bait delivery protocols should be tested given differences in cat detection on and off track (e.g. Wayne<em> et al.</em> 2013); Aerial deployment = 50 baits km<sup>-2</sup> scattered as 50 baits within a 200m x 40m area every 1 km along transect lines space 1 km apart Ground deployment = 100 m intervals along road/track access allowing for replacement during the &ldquo;baiting window&rdquo; but not exceeding 50 baits/linear km/year</li>
<li>Ground baiting is likely to be more successful at baiting cats (i.e. adjacent to tracks) but operationally more limiting (i.e. higher operational costs over equivalent areas; patchy delivery given limitations to tracks that provide adequate forest access; and, potentially access limitations at some times of the year due to dieback hygiene constraints). During the bait uptake trials, camera security is likely to be substantially more problematic on- versus off-track.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Missing data will make analysis much more difficult. The orthogonal and balanced design is very important to maintain throughout the study.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Having 40 sites provides some flexibility in the timing of trials but an incomplete picture throughout the calendar year (i.e. aerial and ground bait trials will only be active during 33% and 67% of the year, respectively). The times of year that are omitted can be regular (e.g. 2 weeks between each trial) or strategic (e.g. avoid periods when baiting effectiveness may otherwise be expected to be poor, such as the wettest times of the year when bait condition may be compromised).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Site selection for Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait uptake trials:</h3>
<p>The southern jarrah forest ecosystem will be subdivided into 5 x 5 km cells (i.e. 2,500 ha each; Figure 1). Criteria for candidate cells include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Study area: southern jarrah forest (SJF) ecosystem and other minor jarrah forest ecosystem types immediately adjacent to SJF (Jarrah - Unicup, woodland, and north east ecosystem types) within the IBRA subregion JAF02 and Warren IBRA bioregion (WAR)), i.e. ~197 cells between Nannup in the northwest, Tonebride in the north east, Rocky Gully and Nornalup in the south east and Peerabeelup in the southwest.</li>
<li><u>&gt;</u>75% area having Conservation Commission land tenure and/or land managed by the Department of Parks and Wildlife.</li>
<li><u>&gt;</u>75% currently subject to Western Shield fox control</li>
<li>Practical access available and relatively close to Manjimup (i.e. to reduce costs)</li>
<li>Candidate areas planned to be burned or timber-harvested during 2016/17 will need to be considered carefully to co-ordinate the trials where possible when/where they won&rsquo;t be adversely impacted</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cell selection from the pool of candidates will be stratified-random &ndash; i.e. the initial cell will be randomly selected and then subsequent cells will be selected based on having a spatial separation of at least 10 km from other selected cells. Each selected cell will be randomly assigned to the sequential order of when and how (aerial or a ground) the baits are deployed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> a) 5 x 5 km grid cells with predominantly southern jarrah forest ecosystems on lands managed by the Dept. of Parks and Wildlife. b) Indicative location of the 40 Stage 1b sites to determine how, when, where best to bait using Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>
<h3>Site layout for Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait uptake trials</h3>
<p>Aerial bait treatment sites will be;</p>
<ul>
<li>located as close to the centre of the cell as possible (to maximise spatial separation from other selected treatment sites)</li>
<li>&gt; 100 m from trafficable tracks and &gt;200 m from main public roads (for site security)</li>
<li>Each site will have 50 bait stations roughly evenly spaced in an approximate grid layout (4 x 13 rows at 13 m x 16 m intervals) within an area of about 200 m x 40 m &ndash; to resemble operational protocols for aerial cat baiting as closely as possible (Algar et al. 2013; &ldquo;Feral Cat Baiting Prescription&rdquo;, Forest and Ecosystem Management Division 2015).</li>
<li>Note: the spatial separations between aerial bait sites will be much greater than the operational deployment of 50 baits km<sup>-1</sup> &ndash; this will affect how the results can be interpreted (e.g. the likelihood of detecting a bait consumption by an introduced predator during the trials may be higher than if the baits were deployed at operational densities (conversely the proportion of cats removed will be lower); similarly, the lower than operational density of baits at the landscape level during the trials will the lower the risk to chuditch but not quantify the risk to individuals that may encounter multiple bait clusters deployed at operational densities).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ground bait deployment treatments sites will be;</p>
<ul>
<li>5 km transects positioned as centrally as possible within the cell and maximising the distance from other selected cells nearby</li>
<li>Forest tracks frequently used by vehicles will be avoided to minimise the disruption cause by temporary road closures.</li>
<li>The roads will be closed to unauthorised access along the baiting transect during the baiting trial on that site (i.e. 4-8 weeks) by means of signs and flagging tape. This is to reduce the baiting risk to humans and their animal companions and to reduce the risk of interference or theft of cameras.</li>
<li>Baits will be at 100 m intervals along the 5 km road/track transect. The bait stations will be 5-10 m off the track with the cameras positioned to conceal them from the track as much as practically possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Bait stations for both aerial and ground treatments:</h3>
<p>Each bait station will have a dummy remote sensor camera deployed for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of the bait trials. A real remote sensor camera (a randomly allocated Reconyx HC 600 or PC900 model) with a toxic Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait at the centre of the field of view will be deployed at the beginning of the bait trials at each site.</p>
<p>The camera will be as concealed as practically possible to reduce detection (i.e. within or adjacent to existing natural structures such as vegetation, logs or debris) but adjacent to and focussed on an open area in which the bait can be placed and monitored by the camera.</p>
<p>Some minimal modification of the vegetation in front of the camera and around the bait location may be required (e.g. selective light pruning) to improve camera surveillance of the bait and the animals around the bait.</p>
<p>The dummy cameras are necessary to reduce the cues and learning by animals of baits being available and to reduce the aversion of some animals to new and artificial objects in their environment (i.e. minimise behavioural responses of animals to the trials &ndash; i.e. observer effect).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Camera set-up protocols for Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait uptake trials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cameras to face between SE and SW (ideally S)</li>
<li>Distance to bait 1.5 m</li>
<li>Cameras to be at height 20-30 cm above ground</li>
<li>Camera settings: 10 images per trigger (HC600 models) or more (PC900 models). No delay between triggers. High sensitivity, motion sensor on.</li>
<li>Security measures: code lock activated, cameras labelled indicating security code protected and engraved,</li>
<li>no flagging tape or any other visible indications of the location of the site or camera/bait stations. GPS co-ordinates of each camera to be recorded.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bait preparation for Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait uptake trials</h3>
<p>Bait characteristics will be identical to those used operationally including, manufacturing process, toxicity, age and preparation. Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait preparation will be done in accordance with the &ldquo;Feral Cat Baiting Prescription&rdquo; (Forest and Ecosystem Management Division, 2015). Prior to deployment;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweat on racks under sunny conditions to allow the oils and lipid-soluble digest material to exude from the surface of the bait.</li>
<li>All baits are sprayed on all sides, during the sweating process, with an ant deterrent compound (Coopex) at a concentration of 12.5 g l<sup>-1</sup> as per the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Timing of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait uptake trials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Four trials (sites) will run simultaneously within a session; 2 replicates of each of two treatments (aerial and ground baiting) (Table 1, Appendix 3).</li>
<li>The length of each trial will include 2-4 weeks with dummy cameras then 2 and 4 weeks for the aerial and ground bait trials, respectively, using real cameras and Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits.</li>
<li>The bait uptake trials will be conducted predominantly in the warmer-drier periods of the year (October &ndash; April) and opportunistically during the forecast drier spells (i.e. 6-7 days with &lt;5-10 mm total rainfall forecast) in the cooler-wetter months between May and September inclusive (i.e. &gt;50 mm average per month). This is in general accordance with the baiting prescriptions designed to avoid moist conditions in which the bait quality may be reduced (Forest and Ecosystem Management Division 2015). While specifics are not provided, a general operational guideline is to aim for &le;5mm of rainfall on the day of baiting and a minimum of 5 days post baiting (Gareth Watkins pers comm.). But we consider temperature, humidity and evaporation rates also to be important factors that affect the duration and magnitudes of ambient moisture levels and there is currently insufficient detail available on how environmental conditions affect bait quality or palatability. This may be examined as part of this study (see part 1c details below). Note that Western Shield protocols for the use of 1080 poison grain baits and dried meat baits is for deployment in conditions when &lt; 6 mm and &lt;40- 50 mm rainfall is forecast , respectively (Parks and Wildlife 2012).</li>
<li>The timing of trials within the group of four sites within a session will be staggered (i.e. start on four successive days, as they are set up) so long as rainfall and extreme weather events are avoided during the four successive setup days and the 3-4 initial days post bait deployment (i.e. similar starting conditions for the four sites). The order of staggered entry within a group will be randomised. Some flexibility in the timing of the start of the trials will be needed to accommodate weather forecasts. If poor weather is forecast, the alternative is to have a staggered setup and simultaneous trial start (i.e. set up cameras over successive days then deploy the baits simultaneously at all four sites when the weather is clear - note this requires more resources / visits to the field sites). Note at least 2 days (3-4 people) are required to set up the 50 camera/bait stations at a site and another full day to deploy and activate the cameras.</li>
<li>Aerial baiting treatments will only have one deployment of 50 baits per trial. The ground baiting treatments will have baits replenished on multiple occasions (<u>&lt;</u> 5 baits per station) within the four week trial period at each site, in accordance with the protocols (&ldquo;&hellip;Baits can be replaced during the &ldquo;baiting window&rdquo; if taken or spoiled but should not exceed 50 baits in total/linear km/year&hellip;&rdquo;, Forest and Ecosystem Management Division, 2015). i.e. up to 250 baits per trial</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research questions and analysis approach for Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait uptake trials</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>General theme: Eradicat</u></strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong><u> bait consumption differences in relation to when, how and where baits are deployed and other factors (i.e. bait effectiveness)</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common response variable(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>Number or proportion of baits consumed by species &lsquo;<em>x&rsquo;</em> per site/trial</li>
<li>Number of individuals of species &lsquo;<em>x&rsquo;</em> that consumed 1 or more baits per site/trial</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: data may be sparse (lots of zeros) for bait consumption by cats, which will have implications for analysis</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q1: Does Eradicat</strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong> bait consumption by the target (feral cat) and non-target species vary according to time of year?</strong></p>
<p>Plot: Average number and proportion of baits consumed by species &lsquo;<em>x&rsquo;</em> per trial within each session (y-axis) by start date of each session (x-axis)</p>
<p>Analysis: possibly just descriptive graphics given temporal factors will be examined in more detail in subsequent questions</p>
<p>Results: Identifies generally when bait consumption by cats and other species is greatest but does not consider differences or interactions due to other factors such as deployment method, habitat and landscape factors, etc.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q2: Does Eradicat</strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong> bait consumption by the target (feral cat) and non-target species vary according to season, within season (session), and deployment method?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysis options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multifactor ANOVA or mixed effects model. The appropriate approach will depend on whether all factors are fixed or whether the time factors represent random effects (session dates probably do).</li>
<li>Log rank tests to examine differences between deployment method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Response variable = number of baits consumed by each species / number of baits deployed or number of trials (i.e. the former takes into account bait replenishment during ground baiting, the latter compares the deployment methods).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q3: Are there environmental factors (e.g. weather, proximity to agriculture, landscape position) or biological factors (e.g. competitors, food availability and breeding seasons) that relate to changes in Eradicat</strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong> bait consumption by i) target and ii) non-target species?</strong></p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential covariates include landscape attributes, site attributes, animal attributes, detectability of the bait, bait condition, and environmental attributes - see Appendix 4 for details</li>
<li>Multivariate analyses would be needed to relate differences in bait consumption or &lsquo;survival&rsquo; to other factors such as time of year, spatial factors, bait uptake by other species, environmental and biological factors, etc.</li>
<li>With only 40 sites the number of covariates in the analysis will be limited (e.g. ~4-6 covariates). Therefore a process of culling covariates will be necessary (e.g. autocorrelation, step-wise approaches, etc)</li>
<li>The use of the information theoretic approach to model selection may be appropriate with this data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>General theme: Nature of Eradicat</u></strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong><u> bait consumption </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q4: How long do Eradicat</strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong> baits last until they are consumed or removed (i.e. bait longevity)?</strong></p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bait longevity can be described as a range (min-max), mean (<u>+</u>SE) and/or median number of days until 50%, 95% or 100% of baits were removed</li>
<li>Plot of mean number of baits (<u>+</u>SE) remaining per day</li>
<li>If there is a high level of variance in the mean number of baits remaining per day and/or the time taken for 95-100% of baits to be removed, then further analyses could seek to account for these differences &ndash; e.g. landscape position, subregion, season, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>Bait survival or Bait consumption by a particular species (i.e. the primary response variable) can be measured using a survival analysis approach (i.e. consumption by other species and camera failures are censored). Pollock&rsquo;s staggered entry model or Kaplan-Meir survival analysis approaches may be appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>General theme: Animal behaviour in relation to baits (i.e. to understand how to improve bait effectiveness)</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q5: How do target and non-target species interact with the baits? Specifically, Do targets and non-targets detect baits? And. once a bait has been detected, do targets and non-targets consume baits?</strong></p>
<p>Once a bait has been detected, do targets and non-targets consume baits?</p>
<p>This will focus on information that provides some indications how to improve target and non-target consumption rates.</p>
<p>General descriptive metrics will include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute number of baits consumed by each species</li>
<li>Absolute number of individuals of focal species (e.g. cat, fox, chuditch) that consumed at least one bait</li>
<li>Proportion of individuals of focal species detected that consumed at least one bait</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed metrics for focal species will include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection rate = # bait detection events / # events animals are within close proximity of the bait (i.e. within field of view of the camera)</li>
<li>Investigation (approach) rate = # baits investigated/ # bait detection events</li>
<li>Contact rate = # baits contacted (i.e. close investigation or physical contact)/ # bait detection events</li>
<li>Consumption rate = # consumed/# bait detection events</li>
</ul>
<p>Other possible metrics include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency or proportion of partial v whole consumption (i.e. what is the risk of sublethal bait consumption by target species?)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Frequency or proportion of baits consumed in situ or removed (i.e. are removed baits likely to be consumed or cached elsewhere; is there a risk that removed baits remain available)</li>
<li>Were solitary or multiple individuals involved (i.e. potential for learning, sub-lethal doses, etc)?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>General theme: Potential impact to individuals and populations of Eradicat</u></strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong><u> baiting on target and non-target species</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q6: Do individuals consume multiple baits in a day or within a baiting session? </strong></p>
<p>i.e. what is the possible risk to vulnerable non-targets?</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute number and proportion of detected individuals of species <em>x</em> that consumed multiple baits.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q7: What is the potential and relative impact of Eradicat</strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong> baits on individuals and populations of feral cat, fox and potentially vulnerable non-target species? </strong></p>
<p>i.e. how many and what proportion of individuals might have been killed by toxic baits? Does this change over space and time? Are there any patterns in the types of individuals that consumed the baits (e.g. size, age, gender)? Is this number or proportion of individuals that consumed baits likely to have a significant impact at the population level?</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>General theme: Recommended Eradicat</u></strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong><u> baiting protocol to maximise efficacy</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q8: When, how and where is it best to conduct Eradicat</strong><sup>&reg;</sup><strong> baiting to maximise bait consumption by feral cats and minimise the risk to non-target species?</strong></p>
<p>I.e. a synthesis of the results from the previous questions and an understanding of the biology and ecology of the target and non-target species to make an assessment of when, how and where Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bating is likely to be most efficient/effective.</p>
<p>Also consider what needs to be done to be informed how to make further improvements on the timing and location of the baits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><u>Other considerations</u></h2>
<p><strong>Low bait consumption rates by cats is a major risk for the bait uptake trials</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Low detection rates of cats and even lower bait uptake rates by cats is expected. A major challenge of this study will be to get sufficient data on cat interactions with baits to satisfactorily inform when, how and where to most effectively use Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> to control cats and minimise risks to non-targets. Cat and fox densities are estimated to be about 1 each per 500 ha &ndash; 2000 ha (A. Wayne unpublished data). Therefore bait uptake is likely to be &lt;1 cat and &lt;1 fox per trial. This means that to get a routine and operationally realistic appreciation of when baits might be most effective to target cats, it is likely to require a lot of replicate trials to get sufficient data.</li>
<li>It would be possible to estimate how many trials might be required but the estimates would be very rough, particularly since bait consumption rates are dependent on the probability a cat or fox comes within close proximity with a bait and guesswork as to what proportion might then actually detect, investigate and consume the bait.</li>
<li>Conversely, based on the proposed experimental design with 40 trials, it might be possible to estimate what consumption rate of baits might be required to get sufficient data to identify significant differences in bait consumption by cats in relation to when, how and where the baits are deployed.</li>
<li>Having trials of the ground baiting protocols are likely to be very important in getting enough data on target species interactions with baits because; 1) introduced predators are detected more frequently on track than off track (Wayne et al. 2013) and replenishment of the ground-deployed baits during the trials increases the opportunities for cats to encounter baits</li>
<li>Data from the uptake trials will be regularly analysed to ensure sufficient data is being generated by the trials. If there is insufficient data then an increase in the number of concurrent trials may be required (e.g. greater than 4 concurrent trials across additional sites, requiring additional cameras and/or the period of the trials may need to be extended).</li>
<li>Note that under the operational conditions of an aerial baiting event with introduced predator densities at these levels, 1 bait consumed by a cat (or fox) for every 250 &ndash; 1000 baits deployed at 50 baits/km<sup>2</sup> (i.e. within a 500 ha &ndash; 2000 ha area) would result in a 100% target removal - this is very low (i.e. 99.2% - 99.8% non-target uptake of baits could indicate a successful baiting program for both cats and foxes).</li>
<li>Need to think what else could be done to improve detection and bait consumption rates &ndash; by cats (i.e. more data) e.g. target areas with high cat densities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Repeat trials and confounding between learning by animals and time of year</strong></p>
<p>Repeat trials on the same sites runs the risk of animals learning and changing their behaviour in relation to the baits (e.g. increased bait attraction or aversion), which is confounded with time of year. This could have a major effect on the study being able to identify when the best time to bait is (e.g. increased non-target uptake by possums or corvids could substantially reduce bait availability to targets over time). Therefore, the number of repeat trials should be minimised and the intervals between repeat trials should be maximised or avoided altogether if possible.</p>
<p>Note: The extent of learning within and between trials might be possible to quantify to some extent if individuals can be confidently identified. But this will be difficult for some problem species such as brush tail possums and corvids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Toxic or non-toxic baits?</strong></p>
<p>These trials could be done with toxic or non-toxic Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits. It is recommended that toxic baits are used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Using toxic baits:</u></p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Trials closer to real operational conditions</li>
<li>Some cat removal may be a direct outcome of the trial (but it will make negligible difference at a population level given the density of trial sites relative to cat densities)</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Necessitates greater/complete spatial independence between sites (i.e. &lt;10 km separation) the consequences of which include a larger study area, higher logistic costs (e.g. vehicle running and travel time), greater variance in the results due to greater variation between sites over a larger area.</li>
<li>There is some risk to non-target native individuals (e.g. chuditch, phascogale, etc) but given the large spatial separation between sites there should be negligible impact at the population level)</li>
<li>There is some risk to domestic cats and dogs that visit the trial sites and nearby if some baits are relocated by wildlife (a risk assessment would be required as part of the baiting approval process)</li>
<li>It will complicate the stage 2 comparative operational trials by potentially removing some cats across all treatments and potentially having some surviving individuals with a prior experience with Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits, albeit at very low densities (i.e. 50 baits per 100 km<sup>2</sup>). Therefore the first application of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> at an operational scale will not be to an entirely na&iuml;ve population (i.e. the scale of impact of the initial operational deployment of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits may be very slightly less than what might have been achieved had the population been absolutely na&iuml;ve).</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Using non-toxic baits:</u></p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>No risk to non-target individuals</li>
<li>Spatial independence between trial sites is not as critical (because cats from earlier trials will not have been removed from the opportunity to encounter baits in subsequent trials nearby)</li>
<li>The bait uptake trials will not influence cat densities for the subsequent Stage 2 comparative trials of the effectiveness of an operational-scale baiting program</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Not identical to operational baits, therefore some additional assumptions as to how the results relate to operational conditions would need to be made</li>
<li>No removal of any cats</li>
<li>Uptake rates of both targets and non-targets (because of multiple consumptions by the same individual) may be greater than with toxic baits. This might be partially accountable if individuals are distinguishable but this may not be possible for some species such as koomal.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Camera security</strong></p>
<p>Camera management and location will be important for security from theft and damage (e.g. from fire)</p>
<ul>
<li>Covert as possible for reducing detectability (also beneficial to the study if it reduces detectability by fauna &ndash; i.e. reduced observer effects) &ndash; based on location (next to/within/under natural vegetation and structures), camouflage (shape, shine, silhouette, surface, shadow, smell), etc</li>
<li>Aerial deployment trials should be relatively low risk - located &gt;100 m from any trafficable vehicle tracks and &gt;200 m from frequently used public roads.</li>
<li>Vehicle access to tracks near the cameras should be temporarily closed during the trials wherever possible. This will also reduce human-related risks of using toxic baits. Departmentally-managed roads can be closed under existing authority provisions available to the department. The roads could be closed with signage, danger tape, official 1080 signs and potentially have a covert camera for incursion surveillance. Signs can be produced cheaply on corflute boards and could be used for other departmental activities such as pig control. The text could state something like,</li>

Having the forest tracks closed with signage will also make workers in the area aware and thereby reduce the risk of damage due to planned burns or wildfire.</li>

<h1>1c) Bait condition trials in relation to Coopex treatment and environmental conditions</h1>
<p><strong>Subject to additional funds being secured</strong>: experimental bait condition trials may be conducted concurrently to the bait uptake trials to;</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the effectiveness of different Coopex application methods to baits aimed at reducing invertebrate impact on Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait characteristics</li>
<li>Determine how environmental conditions influence Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait characteristics, including spatio-temporal factors, the weather and ambient conditions, invertebrate interference, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: This would make an excellent honours or masters student project; Year 1 &ndash; data and sample collection (with or without the student), Year 2 - sample analysis and write up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Testing the effectiveness of Coopex applications</h3>
<p>Design:</p>
<p>3 bait treatments &ndash; sprayed, dipped, no Coopex</p>
<p>3 replicates of each treatment per site</p>
<p>5 sites per trial - each of the 4 bait uptake trial sites and a reference site (i.e. the 4 bait uptake trial sites will vary between trials (total of 40 sites) and the reference site (in jarrah forest near Manjimup) will remain the same throughout the successive trials (i.e. 41 sites in total).</p>
<p>10 trials conducted over a year</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bait condition trial sites will be 1-3 km from the bait uptake trial sites for independence (i.e. to reduce the influence of one trial on the results of the other). Note that independence will not be absolute (because some vertebrates may encounter both trials) but environmental conditions should be comparable between the paired trials sites.</li>
<li>Experimental unit / Bait station = 1 Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait placed in contact with the ground within a 5-sided wire cage cube securely pegged to the ground (i.e. to allow invertebrate access but not vertebrates. Note the size of the cube and the mesh needs to overcome interference from possums and canids that might dig).</li>
<li>Each bait station will be at least 100 m from other bait stations (based on estimated Australian meat ant (<em>Iridomyrmex purureus</em>) territory sizes being &lt;5900 m<sup>2</sup> (Thomas <em>et al.</em> 1999; Note that <em>Iridomyrmex conifer</em> is likely to be the most problematic species in the forest)</li>
<li>The trials will be conducted concurrently to the bait up-take trials and run for two weeks.</li>
<li>Bait condition (photographed, weighed, visual assessment), soil moisture and invertebrate activity will be recorded at the beginning or the trials, at least once during the trials (day 4-10; for the trials associated with the ground baiting and reference sites only) and at the end of the trial (day 14 for aerial deployment trials). At the end of the trials the baits will be retained and frozen for later, more detailed, assessment if required.</li>
<li>Environmental data to be collected at each trial site will include ambient conditions (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and soil moisture by means of data loggers and rainfall gauges; evaporation rates).</li>
<li>Invertebrate species will be sampled i) that are found on the baits when they are checked during the trials, and ii) by means of a pair of delta traps with replaceable sticky bases (one in each pair being baited with 4 cm<sup>3</sup> piece of non-toxic Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait), located ~10 m from each Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait station.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Being able to explain the factors affecting the rates and differences in the degradation of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits is important to being able to understand the scale of the problem and to identify solutions, and when and where they may be needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>1d) Spatial ecology of cats</h1>
<p><strong>Subject to additional funds being secured</strong>. Summary: Radio-telemetry using GPS collars on up to 10 cats will be used to get spatio-temporal data within the Upper Warren region to provide a general understanding of;</p>
<ul>
<li>home range size, area covered per night and other information on movement patterns (e.g. useful to help estimate density, probability of encounter of potential bait locations, etc)</li>
<li>how they use the landscape (e.g. habitat preferences/selection &ndash; landscape position, proximity to agriculture, use of roads and tracks, etc).</li>
<li>try to identify when/where cats are more likely to eat baits, such as feeding areas as distinct from other activities such as shelter, territorial maintenance, breeding, social interaction, etc.</li>
<li>This work is currently unfunded except for the procurement of the GPS collars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cat selection:</p>
<p>Cats for collaring would preferentially be selected in the area(s) within the Upper Warren region anticipated to be involved in Stage 2 of the project &ndash; i.e. the treatment and comparative reference areas for the operational-scale deployment of baits. This is to maximise efficiency and information return from investment (e.g. the same cats and collars could be subsequently used to track comparative survivorship of cats during operational baiting).</p>
<ul>
<li>Sources: farm shed strays/ferals from properties within or adjacent to expansive forest areas may be easier targets, but at least some individuals should be sourced from forest areas</li>
<li>Capture methods will include cage and leg holds and opportunistic captures from wildlife monitoring. Catching cats is the greatest challenge for this project component. Assistance and support from expertise in cat trapping will be critical to its success.</li>
<li>Landholder engagement and support will be important in finding source animals (i.e. an opportunity to integrate this with the community elements of this project).</li>
<li>Reconnaissance using cat sightings, sign and remote sensor cameras will be needed to identify areas and individuals to target for capture and collaring</li>
<li>Given the small sample size it may be difficult to derive clear gender differences in behaviour and movement. Consider only collaring individuals of one gender (Sarah Comer pers. comm.)</li>
</ul>
<p>GPS Collars:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 20 fixes per day (hourly between 1600 and 0800 hrs and at 1000, 1200 and 1400 hrs)</li>
<li>Approximate battery life of 150 days per collar</li>
<li>Remote download every month</li>
</ul>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h1>Complementary approaches that could help identify when, how and where to bait for effective cat control for fauna conservation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Biologically informed &ndash; cat biology/ecology, native prey biology/ecology, predator prey interactions, spatial ecology, etc e.g. risk to chuditch may be reduced if the timing of baiting avoids the period when young emerge from the den and start feeding themselves</li>
<li>Modelling</li>
</ul>
<h1>Stage 2 - Operational deployment of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup></h1>
<p><u>Specific objectives:</u> Quantify the effects of an optimised operational use of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits (informed by stage 1) at the individual and population levels of i) feral cats and foxes, ii) potentially vulnerable non-target native species (e.g. dasyurids), and iii) priority native species threatened by introduced predators (Numbats, Woylies, etc) within the Upper Warren region.</p>
<p><u>Strategy:</u> Conduct an Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baiting program within a limited area of the Upper Warren (e.g. 225-400 km<sup>2</sup>), within a comparative / experimental framework, to assess the effectiveness on target species (cats and foxes) and effects on non-target species (with a focus on potentially vulnerable and priority beneficiaries).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparative treatments will include; 1) Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baiting treatment area, 2) Standard quarterly fox baiting area, 3) Monthly fox baiting area (Perup core, since 2010), 4) An unbaited (Probait and Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup>) area</li>
<li>The effectiveness of the Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baiting event will be examined using a BACI design (before, after, control, impact); considered the most powerful means of making this assessment</li>
<li>Responses of target and priority non-target fauna will be measured at the individual and population levels because each level provides important insights that the other cannot.</li>
<li>Monitoring methods before and after the Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baiting will include (Table 2); - Radio-telemetry (target, and possibly vulnerable non-target species if additional funds can be secured - Remote sensor cameras (all species, especially cats, foxes, numbats, quenda) - Trapping (especially woylies also other native mammals) - Spotlighting (especially western ringtail possums, also phascogales and macropods) - Nestboxes (phascogales)</li>
<li>The monitoring program will use and build on the existing monitoring infrastructure in the Upper Warren to provide best use of historical data and minimise costs of monitoring during this project (Figure 2). New monitoring infrastructure will include 3 nestbox grids, and a trapping and spotlight transect in Talling forest block in the Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baiting area (southern Perup) (Table 3).</li>
<li>Potentially vulnerable non-target native species in the Upper Warren are presented in Table 4. Wambenger (brush-tailed phascogale), bush rat, chuditch and quenda are considered potentially the most vulnerable mammals based on a theoretical worst-case scenario assessment. All four species need to consume less than one or two Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> baits to potentially receive a lethal dose of 1080. Relative to their body mass all four are capable of consuming their respective quantities of bait within 24 hrs (i.e. &lt;9% of their body mass). Consumption rates of dried meat baits (DMB) of &lt;9% body mass have been repeatedly observed being consumed by dasyurids in laboratory trials (Martin et al. 2002 and references within). Because the amount of bait consumed is inversely proportional to the hardness of the food, it is reasonable to assume that these species can eat more Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> bait (which is softer) than DMBs. Most small dasyurids consume about 20-30% of their body mass each day (see Martin et al. 2002).</li>
<li>Bush rats will not be assessed as part of this study because none have been detected in the Upper Warren region since 2005, having been abundant in places in the 1970s (Per Christensen pers comm.) but having declined since at least 1994 (Wayne et al. in review).</li>
<li>The varanid lizards (<em>Varanus gouldii </em>and <em>V. rosenbergi</em>) and some birds (e.g. Australian raven, Australia magpie, some raptors) may also be potentially vulnerable (Table 4), however there is currently insufficient information to more accurately quantify the risks. These species will not be monitored, given the limited resources available. While some traps captures of <em>Varanus rosenbergi </em>are expected during other planned monitoring activities it is not likely that there will be sufficient data to assess population changes without a greater, more targeted monitoring program.</li>
<li>The timing of the operational use of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> will be determined by Stage 1. This in turn will affect the timing of monitoring before and after the baiting operation (Table 5).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Design and analysis</strong></p>
<p>BACI design with ANOVA</p>
<p>Response variables:</p>
<p>Individual level &ndash; survivorship of radio-collared (cats, ideally also foxes, chuditch and phascogales) or trapped animals (chuditch)</p>
<p>Population level &ndash; detection rate (Remote sensor camera, spotlight), abundance estimate (trapping) or occupancy rate (nest boxes) of each species</p>

<p><strong>Table 4. </strong>A worst case scenario theoretical assessment of the potentially vulnerable non-target native animals in the Southern Jarrah Forest based on published estimates of approximate lethal dose (ALD) for 1080 poison and the minimum recorded adult body masses. The degree of vulnerability is expressed in relation to the minimum number of Eradicat<sup>&reg;</sup> and Probait baits required to consume an ALD (assuming 1080 is evenly distributed throughout the bait) and in relation to the amount of bait consumed proportionate to body mass. i.e. species that need to consume less than 1 or 2 baits and/or &lt;20% of their adult body mass to receive an ALD are considered vulnerable. No information on the Australian raven or Australian magpie tolerances to 1080 could be found &ndash; the Little crow is presented as a surrogate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Source: Martin et al. (2002); ^ Source: van Dyck and Strahan (2008); <sup>#</sup> ALD unknown, LD<sub>50</sub> = 50, 235 and 12.8 mg 1080 kg<sup>-1</sup> for <em>V. gouldii,</em> <em>V. rosenbergi </em>and Little crow <em>(Corvus bennetti)</em> respectively, (Dept. of Agriculture 2002); adult body mass estimates are also rough (for Varanus 500g is used as an interim minimum adult body mass, for the Little crow 380 g is the mean adult body mass)</p>

768,"Part of this work relates to that part of Dave Algar's work on cat control, that is being conducted on the south coast. There is a steering committee including Science Division staff and South Coast Region staff, and there is also interaction with Western Shield staff through regional meetings run by Ashley Miller.
","The Western Ground Parrot (CR), Noisy Scrub-bird (VU), Western Bristlebird (VU) and Western Whipbird (VU/P4) are all in need of management action, and some of these actions require research, as specified in the South Coast Threatened Birds Recovery Plan (Gilfillan et al. 2009). Required research relates to the major threats that have been identified (uncontrolled/unmanaged fire, and introduced predators) and to the reduction of taxonomic uncertainty and assessment of genetic risk.

Altered fire regimes have long been known to be a threat to a range of birds and other animals, and their habitats, and it is also clear that management actions often need to be species specific and site specific (eg Burbidge 2003, Woinarski et al. in press). Inapproriate fire is known to be a threat to south coast threatened birds, but our understanding of their  responses to fire is inadequate to inform management across the range of these species.

Cats are known to have potentially devastating effects on bird abundancies and avian communiity structure (eg Crooks and Soule 1999) and mesopredator release can have unintended and unpredicted consequences on vertebrate communities generally (Ritchie and Johnson 2009; Walsh et al. 2012) and it is suspected (Gilfillan et al. 2009) that cats may be a serious problem for Ground Parrots and other threatened vertebrates on the south coast. To date, attempts to control cat numbers at the landscape level in mesic areas of Western Australia have not been successful; there is a clear need to establish sound scientific principles to underpin our management of cats in mesic parts of Western Australia, particularly on those parts of the south coast, such as in Fitzgerald River National Park, that support internationally significant conservation values.

Some taxonomic questions have lead to discrepancies in State and Commonwealth threatened species lists in relation to both whipbirds and ground parrots, and ground parrots appear to have gone through population botlenecks that may lead to significant problems in the management of genetic diversity in both wild and captive populations (Chan et al. 2008; Murphy et al. 2010; Toon et al. in press). Clear resolution of these issues is required to allow informed prioritisation of managment actions and to clarify options for genetic management of ground parrots.
","<p>1. Elucidate the response of Western Bristlebirds to fire, across a rainfall gradient.</p>
<p>2. Determine the impact of cat predation on populations of Western Ground Parrots and other threatened birds on the south coast.</p>
<p>3. Clarify the taxonomic status of the Western Ground Parrot and the various populations of Western Whipbird, and make recommendations for revised threatened species listings.</p>
<p>4. Determine the impact of historical and contemporary population bottlenecks on the genetic variability of Western Ground Parrots, and make recommendations for genetic management of both wild and captive populations.</p>","<p>Development of an understanding of the biological and ecological factors that limit the distribution and numbers of Ground Parrots, Western Bristlebirds and Noisy Scrub-birds, and the creation of management prescriptions that will increase the survival chances of these species and the Western Whipbird, and increase their total population size.</p>","<p>The main users of the knowledge will be the South Coast Threatened Birds Recovery Team, DEC South Coast Region  staff, the Western Shield Program and the Friends of the Western Ground Parrot.</p>
<p>Technology transfer occurs via contributions to deliberations and decisions of the recovery team, interaction with departmental staff in relation to fire management planning and fire prescriptions, contributions to decisions made by the working group on predator management on the south coast, to meetings of the Western Shield Program and South Coast project and operations staff involved in the south coast predator control adaptive management project, to the working group on management of the captive ground parrots, and via publications in international and local journals, newsletters, etc and presentations to conferences, and departmental and community groups.</p>","<p>1. Write up existing data on fire response</p>

2351,"<p>This project relates to SCP 2019-048 regarding the use of remote sensing and spatial analysis to assess and track post-fire vegetation recovery. This area of overlap may provide grounds for useful collaboration between the projects, thus consultation about project development and findings between Val Densmore and Katinka Ruthroff are ongoing.</p>","<p>Prescribed burning is conducted on lands managed by DBCA to minimise the risk that bushfire will have adverse effects on communities, infrastructure and the natural environment and to implement appropriate fire regimes that maintain or improve ecosystem health and resilience. To achieve these primary objectives, DBCA staff prepare comprehensive plans designed to produce fire behaviours within a prescribed range suited to the inherent vegetation type(s) and any special considerations necessary for fire-sensitive species and communities, built assets and heritage values within or near the burn boundary. Prescribing, approving and implementing burn plans adhere to corporate procedures and require substantial resources. However, DBCA does not currently have a systematic approach to assessing, monitoring and reporting on the outcomes of planned burning. Elements of these activities may be done routinely or expressly to meet statutory reporting obligations including fire management performance indicators and Permits to Take Declared Rare Flora, but this occurs in an ad-hoc way. The lack of a systematic approach to monitoring and reporting on the outcomes of prescribed burning creates a corporate risk that the Department&rsquo;s prescribed burns are not achieving corporate objectives and/or that public faith in the department will be compromised by a lack of accountability.</p>
<p>Multiple methods to assess and monitor the severity of planned and unplanned fires have been developed and tested for a range of vegetation types both in Australia and worldwide. Most methods utilise satellite imagery due to the size and inaccessibility of many burned areas and to promote a standardised and objective approach. The differential normalised burn ratio (&Delta;NBR) is currently the standard technique to assess fire severity (Key &amp; Benson 2006, Miller &amp; Thode 2007, Walz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Boer <em>et al</em>. 2008, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hoe <em>et al</em>. 2018), but this method has several limitations to be addressed to make it an accurate and ecologically-meaningful metric. The &Delta;NBR combines spectral reflectances in the visible near-infrared and mid-infrared bands to detect the removal of surface litter, exposed soil, and altered cover, greenness and water content of vegetation (Key &amp; Benson 2006, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2018, Massetti <em>et al</em>. 2019). Images are acquired before and after a fire event to calculate differences between them, helping to account for spectral variation related to vegetation type rather than fire effects. The timing of images is critical because &Delta;NBR is sensitive to seasonal moisture fluctuations and drought as well as fire effects (Key &amp; Benson 2006, Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2006). The method relies on passive satellite imagery that can fail to distinguish the effect of fire on surface or understorey vegetation when overstorey foliage cover is not significantly affected (Boer <em>et al</em>. 2008). Thus, the accuracy of &Delta;NBR decreases in closed forest and when fire severity is low. The ability to distinguish between low and moderate severity classes in a wide range of vegetation types is also an ongoing concern when using &Delta;NBR (Cocke <em>et al</em>. 2005, Miller &amp; Thode 2007, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hoe <em>et al</em>. 2018). Dividing the &Delta;NBR by the square root of the pre-fire NBR may increase the ability to distinguish low and moderate severity classes (Miller &amp; Thode 2007). To verify and improve classification accuracy, &Delta;NBR images also need to be ground-truthed, often using a variation of the composite burn index (CBI) proposed by the FIREMON project (Key &amp; Benson 2006).</p>
<p>The CBI is a plot-based method that quantifies fuel removal, scorch and regeneration of existing or new plants across all strata within a vegetation community (Key &amp; Benson 2006). To sufficiently validate &Delta;NBR classifications, plots must equate to the spatial resolution of satellite imagery (e.g., 30 m for Landsat 8, or 10 m for Sentinel 2), located randomly within an area that has relatively homogenous severity, closely timed to when post-fire images were captured, and at an adequate sampling rate to achieve the desired level of accuracy (Key &amp; Benson 2006, Reinke &amp; Jones 2006, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2018). This latter stipulation requires approximately 1% of the total burn area is sampled to achieve error rates around 2% (Reinke &amp; Jones 2006, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2018), or a minimum of 50 plots within each category of interest (Brogaard &amp; Olafsdottir 1997, Key &amp; Benson 2006). It is argued that plots may be distributed across several burns that have occurred during the same season and in the same vegetation type (Key &amp; Benson 2006). The validity of using CBI has also been questioned, as accuracies typically range between 50 &ndash; 80% and the relative contribution of strata is not weighted when the overall CBI score is calculated. A modified CBI, called the GeoCBI, considers the fraction of vegetation cover (FCOV) by each stratum and has been shown to improve classification accuracy (De Santis &amp; Chuvieco 2009).</p>
<p>To assess burn outcomes on land managed by DBCA, the metrics used to classify fire severity must be simple to implement, repeatable, instructive to fire managers and conservation staff and have a demonstrated ecological basis (Gibbons &amp; Freudenberger 2006). The feasibility and ecological relevance of &Delta;NBR and GeoCBI have not been systematically assessed for the variety of vegetation types that undergo prescribed burning in WA. In addition, other metrics have been proposed in the literature but not tested in WA, including the relative &Delta;NBR (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009) and Vertical Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI; Massetti <em>et al</em>. 2019). Developing a best-practice method to assess burn outcomes will require expertise and consultation across multiple disciplines, including remote sensing, fire behaviour, fire ecology and species conservation.</p>",<p>This project aims to develop the framework for a systematic approach to assessing and reporting on the outcomes of prescribed burns and bushfires and to develop and test a variety of reporting tools and metrics related to environmental outcomes.</p>,"<p>This project is anticipated to improve the ability to quantify spatial patterns of fire severity centred within an ecological framework. A tool will be developed that will link three to four categories of burn severity derived from satellite imagery to field assessments that delineate habitat features that can be used as direct or proximal evidence of fauna habitat, live vegetation cover, and post-burn recovery of flora. An associated outcome will be determining the confidence to which actual burnt areas can be delineated from satellite imagery for different vegetation/fuel types and structures. The tool will be a semi-automated process that offers reasonable (i.e., &ge;75%) accuracy in an initial assessment for all prescribed burns and bushfires, with the opportunity to further refine or investigate particular areas through targeted field verification as needed. The tool(s) developed in this project will support cost-effective and meaningful reporting on the extent to which prescribed burning has achieved specified objectives and success criteria for biodiversity management, bushfire risk mitigation and other land management values, such as forest regeneration. A systematic approach to assessment and reporting will contribute to the refinement of prescribed burn implementation and planning processes, including objectives that are measurable, achievable and relevant to particular land management values. Applying the same approach to quantify spatial patterns of fire severity following bushfires will enable comparisons that inform the effectiveness of the overall fire management program.</p>","<p>Regional fire services staff, Regional and district fire coordinators, District duty officers, Forest Management Branch, Ecosystem Health Branch</p>

Vegetation types will include northern and southern jarrah forest/woodland, karri forest, banksia woodland, kwongan heath and wandoo woodland, although additional vegetation types may be added. Vegetation maps will be created for a select number of burns prior to burn implementation using a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) to photograph along multiple transects that traverse a mixture of vegetation types, according to DBCA&rsquo;s corporate dataset. Resulting images from the RPA will be used with satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 to define classification parameters to facilitate automatic georeferencing of vegetation types across the SWLD using ArcGIS.</p>
<p>The remote sensing component will initially entail using differential normalised burn ratios (DNBR) constructed for each burn or burn cell of interest. To define a post-burn date range, areas treated and implementation dates for prescribed burns will be obtained using the reporting system embedded within the electronic prescribed fire plan (EPFP) with follow-up consultation with relevant fire officers when needed. Subject to the availability of suitable (i.e., cloud-free) images, Sentinel-2 normalised burn ratio (NBR) images will be obtained from Landgate&rsquo;s Aurora website within a date range of one week to two months after burn implementation. An NBR image dated as close as possible to one year prior will also be obtained. Where Sentinel-2 imagery is not available, images from bands 5 and 7 of Landsat 8 will be used to construct the pre and post-burn NBRs. The pre-burn NBR is subtracted from the post-burn NBR to obtain the DNBR. In addition to DNBR, relative DNBR and the vegetation structure perpendicular index (VSPI) will also be trialled on a comparison basis. The relative DNBR is derived by dividing the DNBR by the square-root of the preburn NBR. The VSPI will be calculated according to the methodology published by Massetti <em>et al</em>. (2019).</p>
<p>A field assessment form will be developed using the GeoCBI (De Santis &amp; Chuvieco 2009) modified to reflect the fire response strategies of Australian flora and to capture the gain or loss of primary fauna habitat, such as coarse woody debris and midstorey foliage. The field assessment form will be tested iteratively against field observations and DNBR classifications of burn severity to identify parameters that should be adjusted, included or removed. Regular consultations with departmental fauna officers and researchers will also be held to develop the assessment form. To conduct ground-truthing, the initial DNBR will be classified into four categories from unburnt to high severity using the Jenks Natural Breaks algorithm. Between 10 - 20 points will be distributed across each of the top three categories in each vegetation type with occasional points included in areas classified as &lsquo;unburnt&rsquo; for confirmation. As much as possible, points will be distributed across the burn area that are accessible by internal roads or burn cell boundaries. At each point, a 20 m radius plot will be assessed using the field form to tally an overall severity score and geographic coordinates recorded. Severity scores will then be compared to pixel values on the DNBR at the respective geographic position. User&rsquo;s and producer&rsquo;s accuracies will be assessed using error matrices and Kappa statistics (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). The number of points needed to achieve a suitable degree of accuracy will be tested as per Gharun <em>et al</em>. (2017).</p>
<p>Once a field assessment tool has been developed, the entire process will be tested using participants in the FMDP program. Feedback will be sought on ease of use and accuracy. If possible, the construction of the initial classified DNBR will be automated as much as possible to further facilitate ease of use.

The Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) is responsible for conservation of the State’s biodiversity. Under Australia’s obligation as a signatory to the Convention on Biological Diversity (29th December 1993), a National Representative System of Marine Protected Areas is being progressively established throughout Australia's marine jurisdiction by Commonwealth, State and the Northern Territory governments (ANZECC TFMPA 1999). As part of this process DEC, on behalf of the State Government, is establishing a comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) system of marine protected areas (MPAs) throughout the coastal waters of Western Australia. These MPA’s are vested (legally entrusted) in the independent Marine Parks and Reserves Authority (MPRA) on behalf of all Western Australians under the provisions of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984. DEC also has the legislative responsibility for conservation of marine fauna and flora across all State’s lands and waters. 

 

 

The importance of implementing a standard approach to monitoring, evaluation and reporting (MER) for assets of State and National significance is receiving greater recognition on the road to National biodiversity reporting (e.g. State of the Environment reports and National environmental accounting). Long-term monitoring of condition, pressure and management response in relation to ecological and related social assets (see Appendix A), along with evaluation and reporting is a key element of determining whether management and conservation objectives are being met and if the State is getting ‘value for money’ from their marine management and conservation programs. 

 

 

In response to this need, DEC has established the Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP) which is a statewide long-term, institutional marine MER program currently being developed and implemented primarily to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of MPA and threatened marine fauna biodiversity management and conservation programs. To facilitate and promote management effectiveness WAMMP delivers information on the extent and cause of change in the marine environment using systematic and standardised approaches to data collection, evaluation and reporting over extended periods. Trends in the condition[1] (C) of biodiversity assets is a result of the interplay between natural and anthropogenic[2] pressures (P) and the effectiveness of the management response/s (R) to mitigate these pressures. The primary purpose of MER programs is to provide the asset-based CPR data and trends that are needed to inform adaptive management. MER programs must therefore be designed to ensure that, when changes in asset condition trends are detected, an assessment can be made of whether these changes are caused primarily by natural, anthropogenic or climate change pressures.

 

 

The WAMMP provides quantitative evidence of condition, pressure and management response changes to support the MPRA’s statutory audit function of MPA’s.  WAMMP will also inform Marine Policy and Planning in DEC’s specialist branches and will collaborate with other State and Commonwealth agencies, NGO’s, local communities and industry that have responsibilities or a special interest in marine management and conservation.

 

 

The WAMMP is primarily a partnership between the Marine Science Program (MSP) and the marine staff of the Regional Services Division. The WAMMP is coordinated from the Marine Science Program in DEC’s Science Division by a coordinator who helps to oversee the planning and delivery of program activity, and facilitates input and collaboration from other government agencies and statutory bodies, industry and community groups. The WAMMP has permanent staffing positions allocated to support this strategic focus, with a central science capability in Perth (i.e MSP) and operational support (i.e. marine staff in Regional Services Division) located in regional centers throughout WA (Appendix B). As management agencies cannot comprehensively and effectively manage on their own and the marine environment is owned by all West Australians, DEC benefits greatly from the help of the broader community.

[2] Climate change is an emerging anthropogenic pressure on natural systems worldwide. Because of the potential significance and large temporal and spatial scales involved, CC pressures are treated separately from local scale anthropogenic pressures within the current context. 

 
","<p>This SPP outlines the structure and operational framework of the WAMMP, which is a statewide, long-term, institutional marine monitoring, evaluation and reporting program currently being developed and implemented to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of MPA and threatened marine fauna biodiversity management and conservation programs. </p>
<p>The main aim of WAMMP is: “To facilitate and promote effective and efficient adaptive management in the protection and conservation of marine biodiversity and related social values in Western Australia”. </p>","<p>As part of annual review of WAMMP outputs there is both an internal DEC MPA asset review process and published MPRA performance assessment reports. Outputs from these documents inform the MPRA annual report to Parliament. WAMMP outputs incorporate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refined historical CPR records for Marine Park assets and threatened fauna;</li>
<li>On-going quantitative evidence on the status and trends in selected indicators of condition of assets, the pressure/s on these assets and DEC management responses; </li>
<li>Data to meet legislated audit requirements, and allow measurement of progress towards asset condition, management performance and visitor enjoyment goals; </li>
<li>Information and understanding of the dynamic nature of undisturbed marine ecosystems; </li>
</ul>
<p>In recent years managers and civil society are increasingly becoming aware of the value of long time-series datasets as MER provides a better means of learning from past experience, improving service delivery, planning and allocating resources, and demonstrating results as part of accountability to key stakeholders. This performance assessment and adaptive management framework allows conservation managers to respond appropriately to changes as they become apparent and through measurement, adaptation and delivery cycles, refine our approach to managing ecological and social assets.</p>
<p>The WAMMP provides a formalized assessment to determine warning signals of critical condition change to WA marine assets before these change occur. This improved understanding of the effect of key natural (e.g. temperature, coral predators, disease etc) and human pressures (e.g. fishing, dredging, coastal development) allows time for the development of effective mitigation measures to restore, maintain and manage marine biodiversity.</p>
<p>Data from protected environments also offers complementary understanding to information from the resource extraction (e.g. commercial fishing) and industrial (e.g. offshore drilling, port dredging) sectors. WAMMP data can act as a reference point for comparisons with altered environments, and assist State agencies, regulators and developers in better determining and understanding anthropogenic impacts.</p>
<p>Multi-decadal programs like WAMMP require consistent delivery of data that conforms to agreed standards and has defined quality assurance and quality control processes in place. WAMMP needs systems to facilitate regular i) capture of data, with a place to ii) upload, iii) store, iv) discover and access data. Lastly WAMMP needs to be able to design and produce reports from automated work flows that deliver standardised reporting products from defined raw data sets.  Provision by WAMMP of time-series of asset condition, pressure and management response information captures the corporate history of what DEC has learnt about changes in asset condition, pressures and the effectiveness of management. This helps DEC managers and the community learn through time, and not suffer the ‘shifting baselines’ phenomenon as DEC staff and community change. Information management frameworks that manage the collection, entry, quality control and archival of data-sets, and makes them available to contribute to adaptive conservation management for the full lifecycle of WAMMP will be a major benefit to DEC. The development of these systems and processes to service the needs of WAMMP will also have significant flow on benefits to daily operation and the strategic capacity of DEC.</p>
<p>Recognising the ‘value for money’ imperative, DEC has moved towards an outcome orientated business model that re-affirms the link between management activity and conservation outcomes described in DEC strategic plans and government legislation. WAMMP will play an important part in assisting the re-alignment of work practice and culture, by helping adapt and better integrate DEC business architecture (financial and operational work planning and work-flow designs) and re-focusing effort across work programs to jointly achieve strategic conservation and management objectives.</p>","<p>The information gained from WAMMP will be used by DEC staff for marine reserve management and the recovery and management of threatened marine fauna Statewide. The information gained from marine MER will also be used to inform planning for future DEC monitoring and research, and the EIA process for the design and assessment (surveillance monitoring) of industrial ‘developments’ and resource use related to our coastal and marine systems. Lastly, the information on the status of assets and our management effectiveness is of general interest to the community (from school children to environmentally aligned community groups both within WA and elsewhere), who wish to be informed on current information on WA marine assets and how they can play an assisting role in ensuring the sustainability of our natural and social values.</p>
<p>A comprehensive variety of communications related to the program will be produced in order to transfer WAMMP findings to DEC managers, other marine science providers and the wider public (Appendix C). Science/Management related outputs include an intra annual progress update of MER activity, through the periodic delivery of the WAMMP monitoring matrix (Bancroft et al 2011) and annual performance reviews of MER data and analysis to reflect outcomes against DEC objectives. The annual reporting cycle is staged, starting internally so that science providers and Marine Park Coordinators share and discuss results before reports are made to the community through the MPRA. </p>
<p>The MPRA’s audit function is a statutory requirement under the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 (also known as the CALM Act). For each marine park, comprehensive ecological and social value report cards are presented annually by Marine Park Coordinators to the MPRA within a formal audit process (both verbal and written). The responsibility for, and timing of the delivery of asset information within the management effectiveness process is described in Bancroft, Friedman, and Kendrick (2011), and Friedman et al. (in prep)</p>
<p>Through the repetition of DEC’s monitoring, assessment and reporting cycles and related changes to management, DEC will adaptively evolve and refine its approach to managing assets. Revisions of management activity will be both operational (e.g. changes in annual workplans) and more strategic (e.g. changes in MPA zoning and refinement of management targets in MPA management plans) to ensure tactical and strategic conservation outcomes are attained. </p>
<p>Science related outputs (Appendix C) include the publication of summary asset technical reports and a five yearly outlook report which gives and overview of performance of the reserve system. In addition, peer reviewed journal articles will be produced where applicable. </p>
<p>Communication outputs will also include more ‘general reading’ publications, e.g. DEC Landscope, local newspapers and DEC’s Conservation News. Additional specialised communication outputs for marine park related community interest groups will also be explored. By communicating information about and findings of WAMMP and related changes in asset condition and management, we will foster co-operation and collaboration in the development and implementation of this strategic program, and increase Western Australians’ appreciation of the need to conserve their marine environment. </p>","<p>Year</p>

<p>On the scale of assets within marine parks (ecological and social values, see Appendix A), the question of identifying, defining and prioritising assets for management is broadly completed in individual MPA management plans and threatened marine fauna recovery plans (see <a href=""http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/"">http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/</a> for MPA management plans, see Appendix A for a summary of assets). In addition to defining assets for management, articulated within these management plans are asset specific management objectives, performance measures and management targets (see management framework section, DEC 2005). Such measures and targets are as specific as the current level of knowledge allows, but are definitive enough to allow measurement of MER information against the defined performance measures[1]. </p>
<p>In addition to these requirements, a number of steps are still needed for long-term MER to be conducted, and these tasks are defined within four sub-programs that are being worked on by a range of WAMMP participants (see Table 2 and 3).</p>

<p>WAMMP Coordination</p>
<p>The first priority for the WAMMP Coordinator is to publish a Strategic Plan (termed ‘the Plan’) for WAMMP. The Plan should outline the MER programs aims and objectives and describe the process by which the WAMMP will be designed, established and implemented (Key Step 1, see Table 2). Beyond describing the aims and objectives, the Plan will define the scope of the program and the delivery framework (with guidance on prioritisation), to advise DEC, other government agencies, professional and community collaborators of the range of activity and proposed outputs and outcomes. The Plan should have due regard for capacity and budgetary constraints of DEC, to ensure undertakings are likely to be long-lived. </p>
<p>Historical Time-series and Asset Knowledge Reviews (Key Steps 2 and 3) </p>
<p>Wherever possible, monitoring should make use of, or build upon existing datasets in order that relevant historical data can inform on-going data streams. Historical Time-series development looks for long term value in past “snap-shot” studies implemented in an ad hoc process; opportunistically or in responsive to either political concerns or obvious loss/damage. Available data collected by DEC and other agencies and institutions has typically been collected through disparate studies over varying spatial and temporal scales in studies measured in terms of half decades or less.  Additionally, the information from such studies is not always easily accessible, as most of the data from these studies are only found in grey literature (e.g. government reports), proprietary databases, or are difficult to trace.</p>
<p>Whereas past historical studies have largely been developed opportunistically or in response to particular concerns, the current emphasis of DEC’s Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program (WAMMP) is to develop and implement a more strategic integrated program. For this strategic program to respect past work and benefit from historical datasets, those datasets need to be identified and assessed for viable measures of condition and pressure metrics that can provide a historical understanding and long term context for determining the status and variability of assets. </p>
<p>A practical guideline for assessing and utilising historical information from disparate studies has been developed that outlines how to assess for historical spatial and temporal trends in asset condition and related pressures to assist the development of MER programs (Bancroft and Friedman in prep). This guideline will standardise the approach that WAMMP takes in developing time-series data-sets for assets of interest. </p>
<p>A further foundation priority for the implementation of MER activity is to research, develop and publish Asset Knowledge Reviews (AKR) that ensure the program is informed by available information and well targeted. As there is no ‘off- the-shelf’ guidance to complete these tasks, guidelines will be published on how these processes should be conducted, to ensure there is a standardised and comprehensive approach to these foundational MER issues. </p>
<p>Global and local knowledge of ecosystem function assists in developing conceptual models of how systems work and how a monitoring process might inform management on critical changes. The AKR process, described in a generic guideline by Simpson and Friedman (in prep) outlines a standard process to undertake marine biodiversity asset knowledge reviews that systematically identify and select biodiversity asset condition-pressure-response indicators and methods relevant to the WAMMP. The AKR’s relies on the identification of recognised pressures (natural and anthropogenic incl. climate change) and their relationships to ecological assets for MPA’s across WA, which is the critical link for building a shared understanding of “what” condition, pressure and response indicators to measure, “how” to measure these indicators (i.e. generic methods) and “why” (i.e. the rationale for “what” and “how”). </p>
<p>In AKR’s prepared for individual assets, all the suggested pressures are listed, but only the important pressures are discussed in the context of structural and process monitoring related to asset condition. Pressures are only defined as ‘significant’ if evidence indicates they are known to have occurred, are occurring or are likely to occur in the Western Australian context and are documented to have a ‘high impact’ on asset condition. Pressures are assessed to be ‘potentially significant’ if evidence suggests they may be occurring or may occur in the future and are documented to have a ‘high impact’ on asset condition, while pressures are assessed to be ‘not significant’ if evidence suggests they have not occurred in the past, do not currently occur and are unlikely to occur in the future or if they are localised, transient and documented to have a ‘low impact’ on asset condition. </p>
<p>Following the development of conceptual models and publication of asset knowledge reviews in peer reviewed literature, standard operating procedures (SOP’s) will be published to specify protocols for use in the field or laboratory. These operational step by step instructions ensure that specific monitoring functions are carried out in a standardised way. SOP’s should be clear and concise but with enough detail so that users with a basic understanding, and limited experience, can reproduce methods of the procedures described.</p>
<p>‘Fit to Park’, the process of establishing locations, times and frequencies for sampling (Key Step 4) </p>
<p>Once conservation management objectives are defined (see MPA management plans and Threatened fauna recovery plans) and decisions on what metrics to monitor have been developed (Friedman and Simpson, in prep, Simpson and Friedman in prep), the real challenge to a long term systematic monitoring program like WAMMP is to operationalise monitoring within available budgets to create long-term data sets to inform management. Questions of ‘fitting’ the monitoring to a marine Park (i.e. ‘where’, ‘when’ and ‘how often’ to monitor) are a challenge for the establishment phase of a MER program and require iterative reflection as information is collected through the life of a MER program. This is especially true for MER that operates within the complexity of ecological and social systems in contrast to those associated with complicated but predictable mechanistic processes.</p>
<p>The ‘fit-to-park’ process builds on the AKR process (Simpson and Friedman, in prep), by providing the information needed to implement sampling for each of the indicators selected. In the fit-to-park process we consider the environment for monitoring, the inherent nature of the asset and spatial and temporal scales at which natural, anthropogenic and climate change pressures are acting when planning sampling regimes (Underwood 1992; Morrissey et al. 1992). This builds on the foundations of well defined objectives, and an agreement between managers and scientists over what departures from stable baselines, or comparisons between different management zones (effect sizes) are required to be determined through monitoring. Ideally CPR monitoring programs should be capable of detecting significant condition change attributable to a specific pressure[4], with a departure from acceptable limits that allows sufficient time for management to intervene and mitigate damaging impacts. This requires a number of considerations to be dealt with to ensure the MER program can be effective:</p>
<p>1)     a sound sampling regime that considers how broadly to sample; </p>
<p>2)     a process to guide where to locate sampling sites; </p>
<p>3)     a process to guide when to sample (within a day, month year), and </p>
<p>4)     a process to guide how frequently sampling sites need to be surveyed through time.</p>
<p>When considering these questions, decisions made to guide the monitoring process must be made with consideration of cost and practicality within the context of local staffing and budgetary constraints (Field 2005). </p>
<p>The ‘fit-to-park’ process identifies answers to questions 1-4 for individual assets both at an asset level across the State, and at an asset level within individual management area. This guides the establishment of MER sites and in out-going years, re-sampling of sites to ensure the MER program is responsive to changes in CPR signal. Once a decision is made that re-sampling of condition or pressures is warranted, this can proceed a number of ways depending on the perceived level of need/risk: i) temporal options; when to re-initiate sampling?, ii) spatial options; whether to re-sample all or just a subsample of sites?, and lastly iii) to what degree should re-sampling be conducted (See Appendix D). If re-sampling is initialized at a tactical level and results indicate there may be issues of concern, the sampling level can be escalated to ensure sufficient condition or pressure understanding is acquired to inform management. In order for WAMMP to build the long-term time series data sets of condition, pressure and response needed to guide management over strategic time-scales, the content and level of sophistication of WAMMP inquiry should focus on delivering “sufficient” information for management decision-making (Field et al. 2004, 2005, 2007), and where more information is needed, to increase the intensity of data collection through more investigative monitoring, and/or the use of specific research projects (See Appendix D). </p>
<p>A generic ‘fit to park’ paper has been prepared to provide practical guidelines in the form of a list of factors to consider when making decisions about “where” and “when” and “how often” to monitor whilst developing sampling designs for MER programs (Friedman and Wilson, in prep). These principles should ensure that the initial data sets address the majority of MER objectives, whilst providing baseline information that supports on-going sampling decisions.</p>
<p>Agency Reporting and MPRA Audit Function (Key Step 5) </p>
<p>The annual work-flow of MER for WAMMP comprises four main steps:</p>
<p>1) planning of monitoring for each financial year;</p>
<p>2) interim reporting of progress through the year with the use of a ‘monitoring matrix’;</p>
<p>3) reviewing of results in MPA annual reporting meetings, primarily between asset leaders and Marine Park managers[5]; and </p>
<p>4) formal performance assessment review reporting that is completed by each Marine Park manager, and presented in a summarising all-parks report for the MPRA. </p>
<p>The results of an annual monitoring cycle are evaluated by science staff and MPA managers who discuss the status of assets in face to face meetings once a year. External parties with information to input into the process are also encouraged to make written submissions to individual asset leaders or to attend these meetings in person. The purpose of these meetings is to capture information from MPA managers and asset leaders who have local and state-wide insights respectively, and to share understanding across the range of assets listed at each MPA. Annual asset CPR report sheets are prepared following MPA meetings by asset leaders and these are collated into Annual MPA CPR reports which are supplied to the relevant MPA managers. This scientific advice is used by MPA managers in designing and delivering on-going management and management effectiveness reporting to community representatives (annual performance review documents for Marine Parks and Reserves Authority). </p>
<p>A fundamental part of the Marine Parks and Reserves Authority’s (MPRA) statutory function as outlined in s26B of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 is to set performance criteria for evaluating the carrying out of the management plans; and conduct periodic assessments of the implementation of the management plans. The MPRA implement the audit process at three levels: </p>
<ol>
<li>an Annual Performance Assessment Review of each marine park management plan; </li>
<li>a Periodic Audit (nominally 3 to 5-yearly) of each marine park management plan based on preceding Annual Audits; and </li>
<li>a 10-yearly Audit of each marine park management plan based on preceding Annual and Periodic Audits.</li>
</ol>
<p>A performance assessment report of DEC’s overall effectiveness in relation to conserving key ecological and social values is presented annually by Marine Park managers to the MPRA within a formal process (both verbal and written). The written all park summary provides the MPRA with an update on the status of asset key performance indicators (KPI’s) with a focus on providing evidence through time series data where feasible. In addition to reporting on KPI’s there is also reporting by exception for other non-KPI assets for any non-desirable asset condition, significant change in pressure, or where there are concerns about the management response. Individual written MPA performance assessment reviews have also a summary and detailed report card section which provides an assessment of the condition, pressures, and management responses for ecological and selected social values (both quantitative and qualitative assessments). The face to face meetings between DEC and the MPRA held in October of each year provide the MPRA to opportunity to discuss questions of implementation of priority strategies or actions of the management plans, any concerning trends in ecological asset condition-pressure-response or the effectiveness/efficiency of DEC management of assets, and allow Marine Park Coordinators to highlight adaptive management responses.</p>
<p>The responsibility for, and timing of the delivery of asset information within the management effectiveness process is further described in Bancroft, Friedman, and Kendrick (2011), while a description of the MPRA performance assessment framework by Lloyd et al (2005) and Friedman et al. (in prep) gives further insight into how C/P/R information is delivered to DEC and the community.</p>
<p>Information Management (Key Step 6) </p>
<p>As the primary purpose of WAMMP is to supply managers with information that allow their conservation programs to operate more effectively and efficiently, WAMMP needs systems and processes for the orderly handing of the full lifecycle of WAMMP data and related documents. Information management and data governance at a strategic timescale will be critical to the success of this long term monitoring program.</p>
<p>Information management (IM) requirements for WAMMP centre on having:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ‘fit for purpose’ data wharehouse to store information (including raw data, Pdf library references, digital images and digital video) in formats that are compliant with current standards; </li>
<li>Defined rules and guidelines to ensure consistent information handling processes (upload, store, discover and access data), and that access to data, imagery and documents is orderly and controlled; </li>
<li>‘Version control’ that allows documents to be changed, but ensures only one ‘working’ version (points of truth) for corporate documentation (e.g. project documents, method descriptions, experimental designs, standard operating procedures, data-sets and reports) is discoverable; and </li>
<li>Automated work-flows that deliver standardised reporting products from raw data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long-term monitoring is by nature multi-decadal, and therefore careful consideration of the rules (e.g. for access and changes) and standards (e.g. formats, software, languages) that are adopted for data management need to deliver consistent information management and archiving so that information is discoverable through time. A more in-depth review of this requirement is available in a separate IM plan (Mayer and Friedman 2011, in press), and manuscript (Mayer, in prep).</p>
<p>Stakeholder Participation &amp; Communication (Key Step 7) </p>
<p>Timely briefs, trend analysis, synthesis and outlook reports need to highlight variation in the condition of assets, the pressures they face and DEC’s management response. In order to communicate results effectively and efficiently, audiences need to be targeted with key messages in appropriate language and formats to ensure conservation outcomes reach the community and DEC fosters community support for conservation activity. </p>
<p>As part of the periodic reporting of results WAMMP should also synthesise achievements and learning more broadly in an outlook synthesis report. This communication is principally about communicating scientific knowledge to positively influence community attitudes and behaviour towards conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment. It is also about influencing the attitudes of politicians, media and industry groups with the aim of building confidence about governance, regulation and the use of science and technology. It promotes a better public understanding of the natural and social environments and their interaction, and positively influences both attitudes and the behaviour of users and interest groups in regard to conservation management initiatives.</p>
<p>Australia’s marine jurisdiction is a community asset ‘owned’ by all Australians, and much of the ocean is a common asset available to the National and International community. Management agencies cannot comprehensively and effectively manage on their own and will benefit greatly from the help of the broader community. WAMMP recognises that the general community (and community groups) has broad ranging access to coastal waters and can bring local knowledge, expertise, energy and commitment and resources to the MER process. The WAMMP will engage with community groups to foster improved stewardship and appreciation in marine and coastal management and facilitate engagement and information exchange between the community and asset managers.</p>
<p>A Marine Community Monitoring (MCM) ‘tool box’ of simple but effective marine monitoring methods including resources for making identification of marine assets has been developed by DEC to assist local interest (dive groups etc), commercial and school groups to participate in monitoring. These initiatives can support institutional scientific monitoring programs where they are designed correctly, implemented under supervision and have structured data management and reporting processes that comply with standard protocols. MCM is especially useful as an ‘early warning tool’ for identification of harmful processes (coral bleaching, predator outbreaks, localised pollution events etc) and offers the opportunity for DEC managers to get a information on assets over a large area for ‘Tactical MER’ (see Appendix D). </p>
<p>With the wide-scale ownership of digital cameras, GPS technology, smartphones etc. and the ability to distribute and receive data through the internet, community sourced information will play a larger part in monitoring of assets across the State in the future. </p>
<p>Within WA, Nationally and Regionally the WAMMP can pass and receive information to the benefit of ourselves and other MER programs. Sharing of MER data collected with standardised approaches by industry, State Governments and regional networks for sharing of marine area management information is already underway across Australia, in Asia and countries bordering the Indian Ocean. However, despite WAMMP having structured monitoring approaches (and related outputs), there are few formal links or networks operating to share such management information with its neighbours. In the medium term, WAMMP should forge links with neighbouring networks and marine management institutions, to build sharing arrangements that will enhance regional skill bases and better understand results on asset change, part of which reflect chronic pressures and management responses to broad-scale climate change.</p>
<p>Such sharing networks would support three main activities:</p>
<p>i.           Conceptual sharing: Getting MER frameworks aligned for assessing ecological and social values</p>
<p>ii.          Audit “case study” sharing: A framework for sharing of annual and 5 yearly audit assessments and ‘report cards’ that report on ecological and social asset information in a “condition-pressure-response” format.</p>
<p>iii.         Capacity sharing: This component would encourage WA MPA’s to host neighbouring key marine park staff for training and sharing trips. WA WAMMP and marine park staff would also participate by doing placements across Australia and the region.</p>

2841,"<p>There are no explicitly social science-focussed research projects that have been conducted as part of the DHINPERP. However, the DHINPERP community engagement activities are underpinned by the following projects which are focused upon the ecological restoration of DHI:</p>
<p>2019-030 &ndash; Ecological restoration of Dirk Hartog Island National Park through fauna reintroductions <br />2018-106 &ndash; Disease risk analysis in support of the translocation of dibblers from the Jurien Bay Islands to Dirk Hartog Island National Park <br />2018-009 &ndash; Dirk Hartog Island vegetation monitoring <br />2016-030 &ndash; Dirk Hartog Island National Park Ecological restoration Project &ndash; fauna reconstruction <br />2014-003 &ndash; Cat eradication on Dirk Hartog Island <br />2013-021 &ndash; Monitoring of threatened birds on Dirk Hartog Island <br />2012-440 &ndash; Cat eradication on Dirk Hartog Island <br />2012-202 &ndash; Parasites and diet of feral cats and rodents on mainland Western Australia and offshore Islands (Christmas Island and Dirk Hartog Island)</p>
<p>I have had a number of formal and informal meetings with people relevant to this work including Dr Saul Cowan, Dr Lesley Gibson, Steve Nicholson, Gavan Mullan, Karl Brennan and Wendy Payne.</p>","<p>Dirk Hartog Island (DHI) is Western Australia&rsquo;s largest island and predominantly comprises 620 km2 of sand dunes occupied by open heath and low closed/open heath. Historically, it had a diverse fauna and rich flora (over 250 species recorded, including several local endemics). Sheep and goat pastoralism degraded the island&rsquo;s vegetation and eight invasive weed species are present on the island. Invasive alien fauna, notably cats, decimated the native mammal fauna.</p>
<p>DHI is located within the traditional lands of the Malgana Aboriginal People and the Shark Bay World Heritage Area. It was gazetted as a National Park in 2009. Funding for a 20-year ecological restoration initiative through the Net Conservation Benefits Fund (NCBF) in 2008 allowed restoration of the island&rsquo;s vegetation communities and mammal and avian fauna. Thousands of sheep and goats were eradicated by 2017. Cat eradication began intensively in 2012 with DHI declared cat-free in October 2018. These activities prepared the island for fauna reintroductions which began in 2017 with translocation of two hare-wallaby species, with 11 more species planned for reintroduction over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>A community engagement project has comprised one element of the ecological restoration project. Its primary objective is to communicate the project to stakeholder groups and gain community understanding and support for the project. Stakeholders include neighbouring landholders on Dirk Hartog Island, Shire of Shark Bay, Shark Bay Community, all DHI visitors including DHI Lodge visitors and national park visitors, key contributors including NCBF, volunteers, special interest groups including Birdlife Australia, the tourism community, as well as WA visitors to Shark Bay.</p>
<p>Community engagement activities have included: signage on the island and the nearby mainland, biosecurity signage at Edel Land, information on the DBCA Explore Parks and the Sharkbay.org website, ongoing biannual newsletter (Wirruwana News), ongoing updates in the town&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inscription Post&rdquo; four times annually, social media via DBCA Facebook page including all Denham groups, a permanent interpretive display at Monkey Mia, community artwork projects, children&rsquo;s activities in local schools and school holiday activity programs, DHI visitor and biosecurity brochures, stalls at key events including the Bush Heritage Science Fair, Denham markets, and biosecurity welcome packs for island visitors.</p>
<p>Understanding stakeholder&rsquo;s values, attitudes and behaviours is fundamental to ensuring an effective project and for adapting future communication and engagement activities, as required. An evaluation of the community engagement activities provides the opportunity to determine the effectiveness of the project.</p>","<p>The aim of this research is to assess the effectiveness of the Community Engagement Program of the DHINPERP by determining the level of experience with, and understanding of, DHINPERP outreach activities with the residents of the Shire of Shark Bay. This will be achieved by securing the following objectives, specifically understanding: 1) the experiences residents have had with the DHINPERP; 2) residents have of the goals, past and future activities and anticipated outcomes of DHINPERP; 3)what residents value about the DHINPERP; and 4) how residents would prefer to engage with the DHINPERP in the future.</p>","<p>This research provides an evaluation of the DHINPERP community engagement program. This activity provides:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information on Shire of Shark Bay resident&rsquo;s attitudes towards, behaviours as regards, and levels of understanding of, the DHINPERP which provides insights that can inform future DHINPERP activities and the post-2022 community engagement strategy;</li>
<li>A benchmark for future evaluations;</li>
<li>A mechanism for connecting DHINPERP to important stakeholders;</li>
<li>Demonstrable interest by DBCA, and the DHINPERP specifically, in the residents of the Shire of Shark Bay which has the potential to foster goodwill and partnerships;</li>
<li>An improved understanding by DHINPERP staff and Management Committee of the utility of social science; <br />The first formal activity between the BCS Social Scientist and staff from DHINPERP and the Denham District office.</li>
</ol>
<p>These expected outcomes are aligned directly with several of the &lsquo;DBCA Strategic Directions 2018-21&rsquo;, notably &lsquo;Natural and cultural values&rsquo;, &lsquo;Our community and partners&rsquo; and &lsquo;Our people&rsquo;.</p>
<p>These expected outcomes are also aligned directly with several of the Strategic Themes identified in the &lsquo;BCS Science Strategic Plan 2018-21&rsquo;, notably &lsquo;Availability of scientific information for evidence-based decision-making&rsquo;, &lsquo;Community engagement in science&rsquo;, &lsquo;Social science&rsquo; &lsquo; Collaboration with science providers, science users and other stakeholders&rsquo; and &lsquo;Science operates with a collaborative culture&rsquo;.</p>","<p>The outputs and outcomes generated by the project will be directly used by DBCA staff, including staff from the DHINPERP, the Denham District office, and Parks and Visitor Services. Research findings from the project can be integrated into future iterations of the DHINPERP Community Engagement Strategy, the DHINPERP Biosecurity Strategy, the DHINPERP Strategic Plan, the Midwest Region Regional Conservation Plan, as well as future research in the area on topics such as tourism and biosecurity. Knowledge gained through this research will be delivered to relevant staff in the form of a formal debrief with project and District staff, short informal discussions with project and District staff, a short technical report, and if required a formal presentation to the DHINPERP Management Committee. Close liaison between the Research Scientist and the Regional Interpretation Officer, and more generally the Project Manager, will ensure knowledge transfer from this research into practical applications. If appropriate, research findings will also be communicated to a wide range of stakeholders through seminars, and local print and social media. Findings could form part of future grant applications.</p>","<ol>

<p>The methodology to be applied for this research comprises eight stages:</p>
<p>1) Strategic review of relevant literature <br />A sound understanding of the i) history and operations of the DHINPERP; ii) its community engagement activities; iii) the study population (i.e., the Shire of Shark Bay community); and the broader context in which the DHINPERP is situated (e.g., operations of the Denham District office) is essential to ensure that the questionnaire and the survey platform are appropriate. The strategic review will include, in the first instance, the Community engagement Strategy documents for 2015-2017 and 2019-2022, as well as various DHINPERP and Denham District strategic planning documents.</p>
<p>2) Scoping interviews with key DBCA staff linked to the DHINPERP <br />Understanding the context in which research, and subsequent conservation activity (and in this case community engagement activity) is to be undertaken is essential for effectively, equitably and cost-efficiently designing and implementing a social science research project (Babbie and Mouton 2007; Knight et al. 2019). Whilst a literature review can provide a broad understanding of context, an accurate, precise and nuanced understanding of a human community requires carefully targeted research (Babbie and Mouton 2007). In the absence of such research, of even if it is present, but it was conducted some while before the present, scoping interviews can be used to sample a subset of participants. Semi-structured scoping interviews are to be conducted via Teams and/or telephone with individuals closely associated with the DHINPERP, specifically project and Denham District office staff. Ethics approval will be secured from the Social Science Coordinator of PVS to ensure the interview, and subsequent piloting and online questionnaire are appropriate.</p>
<p>3) Identification of potential participants using a stakeholder analysis <br />Stakeholder analysis is an essential prerequisite of any survey to ensure that it is reliably targeted towards an appropriate sample of individuals (Babbie and Mouton 2007). Appropriate criteria for identifying potential participants are to be sourced from an unstructured content analysis of DHINPERP community engagement literature and informal discussions with key DHINPERP staff (see Stage 2 above). In the first instance, these would ideally be individuals known to have participated in DHINPERP community engagement activities. No record is known of that can provide this information, as no log identifying individuals who have participated in DHINPERP community engagement activities appears to exist. In this instance, a blanket survey of all Shire of Shark Bay permanent and temporary residents will be implemented. Participants will remain anonymous throughout the survey.</p>
<p>4) Design and review of an online survey <br />Internet-based (online) surveys provide a widely-used, cost-efficient method for rapidly sampling large populations of people (Babbie and Mouton 2007). Insights generated through the literature review, scoping interviews and the stakeholder analysis (Stages 1-3) will be used to determine the scope and method of the online survey, noting the method used for previous surveys. The structure and content of questionnaires typically used by PVS will also be considered in an effort to align with existing survey methodologies. A structured questionnaire format will be developed in Microsoft Word and used to facilitate rapid data analysis, and will include single-choice, multiple-choice and Likert statement items. The questionnaire will include items seeking data on the participant&rsquo;s connections with Dirk Hartog Island, their understanding of DHINPERP activities, their perspectives and opinions on the work of the DHINPERP and their demographic information. To mitigate any potential risks perceived with the sample population as regards political and social sensitivity, and to ensure the robustness of the questionnaire, it will be reviewed by the DHINPERP Project Manager and Community Engagement Officer, the Denham District Manager and Senior Operations Officer, PVS Social Science Coordinator and the ED BCS.</p>
<p>5) Development of the online platform <br />The Qualtrics internet-based survey platform will be used to house the questionnaire. The Microsoft Word version will be used as the template for the online version, and adapted as required to fit the requirements of Qualtrics. The questionnaire will be formatted to facilitate completion on desktop, laptop and smartphone hardware. The use of Qualtrics allows the questionnaire to be accessed anywhere that internet access is possible. The survey will be piloted on five Shire of Shark Bay residents sympathetic to the role and responsibilities of DBCA as identified by the Senior Operations Officer of the Denham District Office. Findings from the pilot interviews will be used to refine the survey prior to distribution.</p>
<p>6) Distribution of the survey to potential participants via email and social media <br />The DHINPERP Community Engagement Officer will circulate a URL to the questionnaire housed on the Qualtrics internet platform to contacts in the Shire of Shark Bay office and the numerous community groups known throughout the Shire. Websites related to DBCA and the Shire of Shark Bay and Twitter will also be used to circulate the survey. Flyers advertising the survey and presenting the weblink and a Q-code to access it, will be prepared by PICA and distributed by Denham Office staff to local businesses in Shark Bay to present in store-front windows.</p>
<p>7) Analysis of the survey data using appropriate software <br />Survey data will be exported from Qualtrics in .csv file format, formatted for analysis and &lsquo;cleaned&rsquo; to ensure it is analysable. Simple but appropriate summary statistics, for example, totals, means and modes will be generated from the data using Microsoft Excel. Data will be stored in a password protected file, and accessible only to the Principal Investigator.</p>
<p>8) Reporting of the findings <br />Returning information to relevant stakeholders is an essential part of a scientifically robust and ethical social science research project (Babbie and Mouton 2007), as no research project exists in isolation, and the information provided by such research can empower, or not, different stakeholder groups (Midgley 2000). In the first instance, findings of the study will be reported to the DHINPERP Management Committee for their consideration in a short summary report, and verbally in-person or via Teams, if requested. Subsequently, findings will be reported to stakeholders deemed relevant by the DHINPERP Management Committee, which could include the Shire of Shark Bay, community groups who participated in the survey and DBCA PVS staff.</p>",granted,False,<p>N/A</p>,not required,False,not required,"<p>Notes and descriptive data will be archived, maintained on the T:\ drive and my computer, and backed up regularly.

<p>Study Region</p>
<p>The focal areas for this study will be the North Kimberley Bioregion. Study areas include Mitchell River, Prince Regent, Drysdale River and King Leopold National Parks and adjacent areas. A network of monitoring sites in these areas will link with monitoring sites established or proposed in the wider Kimberley by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, Ecofire properties and traditional owner groups. Monitoring is currently underway at Theeda and Doongan stations (C. Myers Dunkeld/Ecofire) and at Mornington and Charnley River stations (S. Legge AWC/Ecofire). Methods used will be compatible with other monitoring programs in the region so that meta-analysis can be undertaken.</p>
<p>Sampling strategy and methodology</p>
<p>Sampling will be based primarily around previous historical survey sites. This allows comparison with mammal data from previous surveys. Historical survey sites include the Kimberley Mammal Survey 2003-2004 (Start et al. 2007), WA Museum sites (e.g. Bradley et al. 1987), Kimberley Fire Project sites (Palmer unpublished 2001-2002) and North Kimberley sites monitored from 2007-2010 (Radford 2012).</p>
<p>Historical surveys were stratified across major geological and vegetation types. In the North Kimberley these habitat types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandstone (rugged rocky),</li>
<li>Sandstone woodland (sandplain)</li>
<li>Volcanic open woodland (basalt slopes)</li>
<li>Volcanic riparian (blacksoil)</li>
<li>Laterite forest/woodland (bauxite plateau)</li>
<li>Rainforest (closed forest)</li>
</ul>
<p>To test for the effects of management regime, historical sites in the Mitchell area are classified into management categories for statistical comparison. Monitoring sites were grouped into high and low fire frequency, and high and low cattle density groups for analysis.</p>
<p>Cattle abundance data among groups of monitoring sites is derived from spatially explicit aerial cattle culling records. Ground layer visual assessments of cattle degradation, cattle number and signs of cattle will be made at monitoring sites as verification of regional patterns of cattle cull numbers. In addition, aerial assessment of cattle pads and degradation will be undertaken as part of the culling program to relate cattle numbers with on-ground cattle degradation.</p>
<p>Annual fire regimes will be quantified through records of fire patchiness (% ground layer burnt), intensity (scorch height) and extent of fire (distance to fire scar edge) for all fire events at study sites. The North Australian Fire Information website (NAFI) is used to provide long term data on fire frequency and size/intensity for analysis of fire impacts in areas with monitoring sites.</p>
<p>Survey site configuration</p>
<p>The basic sampling design will be based on the standard 50 x 50 m quadrat advocated by Woinarski et al. (2010) for tropical savannas. A diagonal 50 m long transect from corner post diagonally through the site towards the opposite corner will be the basis of most vegetation measures. A photo point will be used at the start of the 50 m transect to characterize vegetation post-fire status, with a post at 10 m to provide a focal point for photos. One photo will be taken of ground layer vegetation (1/3 photo above horizon) and one of the tree and shrub layer (2/3 above the horizon). The post will mark the centre line of the photos.</p>
<p>Vegetation structure</p>
<p>The following vegetation structural measurements will be made at each sampling quadrat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominant species in all vegetation strata layers</li>
<li>Height of tree and shrub strata</li>
<li>Foliage projected cover of tree and shrub layers</li>
<li>Basal area of trees/shrubs</li>
<li>Ground percentage bare soil</li>
<li>Ground percentage litter</li>
<li>Ground percentage perennial grass, annual grass or forb</li>
<li>Log number</li>
</ul>
<p>Trees (&gt;4 m high) and shrubs (1-4 m) will be assessed at 2 measurement points made at each end of the 50 m transect. Bitterlich gauge counts (one for basal area and one for project foliage canopy cover) will be made for tree and shrub strata. Tree and shrub strata heights will be estimated based on inclinometer readings for a subsample of trees. Herbaceous layer vegetation attributes and sub-shrub projected canopy cover will be estimated using a transect intercept method along the 50 m transect, and will be based on ground cover estimates of different cover components (bare, perennial grass, litter, annual grass, shrub canopy). Logs (&gt;5 cm diameter) intersecting the transect line will be counted.</p>
<p>Vegetation structural measurements for these monitoring sites are a combination of attributes from CSIRO (2009), Woinarski et al. (2004) and Radford (2012). Additional vegetation description parameters including transect bearing, aspect, slope, soil colour and texture, co-ordinates, landscape element and landform patterns will be recorded for integration into standard vegetation description protocols (CSIRO 2009).</p>
<p>Mammal survey</p>
<p>Mammals will be sampled as per Woinarski et al. (2001, 2010) and Legge et al. (2008, 2011). Twenty Elliott traps (10 large and 10 medium) will be placed at 10 m intervals around the external perimeter of the 50 x 50m quadrat. In addition 4 wire cage traps will be placed at each corner of the 50 x 50 m quadrat. Sites will be trapped for 5 consecutive nights during each trap session. Animal weight, head length, pes length and, in the case of rodent species, combined head-body and tail length will be measured to facilitate species identification and assess body condition. Reproductive condition will be assessed by inspecting pouches for maturity and number of offspring, and by measuring testes width. Dasyurus hallucatus and Isoodon spp. will be individually tagged using micro-chips. Rodents will be earmarked using permanent marker pens to allow for recapture rates to be calculated at the time of study.</p>
<p>Two remote movement sensitive infra-red automatic cameras will be deployed at each monitoring site during trap runs. This will identify additional mammal and bird species which are not represented in trapping data. These will include information on larger animals including the predators (dingoes and cats), cattle, macropods and possums. Dried meat baits, secured with wire mesh and tent pegs, will be used to attract predators to cameras to increase the chance of detection.</p>
<p>Rainforest structure and status</p>
<p>Rainforest patch vegetation structure and mammal status will be monitored at 5 sites in Mitchell River area, and 2 sites in Prince Regent National Parks to determine impacts on rainforest values of incursions by fire and cattle. Monitoring sites will be set up in the same way as for other monitoring sites. On-ground data will be compared with aerial analysis of rainforest patch dynamics using sequential aerial photographs.</p>
<p>Additional data: threatened birds</p>
<p>Abundance of target fire sensitive bird species including granivorous birds (finches, partridge pigeon) and ground foraging/nesting species (e.g. purple crowned fairy wrens, black grass wrens, red-backed fairy-wrens) was recorded at 50 x 50 m quadrats in 2011. Instantaneous bird surveys were conducted within mammal monitoring sites. Bird observations were made within the surrounding 2 ha of land adjoining the mammal quadrats. Instantaneous observations took place over 20 minutes at each site, and sites were done twice during the 5 day monitoring period.</p>
<p>Bird observations will only be done opportunistically in monitoring from 2012 onwards. Initial analyses suggest that little of the variation in bird group abundance is attributable to land management historical factors (e.g. fire frequency and cattle density) or vegetation condition attributes.</p>
<p>Site logisitcs</p>
<p>Field work logistsics are based on the assumption that 2 trained and experienced staff can monitor 8 sites over 5 days. Therefore, each field trip will conduct two trap sessions to do 16 sites in a 12 day field trip in the north Kimberley. Four field trips will be scheduled annually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helicopter support will be required for monitoring sites in Prince Regent and Drysdale River National Parks. Due to logistical constraints, monitoring surveys will be conducted only every second year in each of these remote parks.</p>
<p>Site breakdown</p>
<p>Mitchell River: 5 Rainforest, 4 Sandstone rocky , 4 Sandstone woodland, 4 Laterite forest, 4 Volcanic woodland, 4 Volcanic riparian (n=24). Additional vegetation only sites will be assessed as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>King Leopold: 2 Sandstone rocky, 2 Sandstone woodland, 2 Volcanic woodland, 2 Volcanic riparian (n=8).</p>
<p>Prince Regent: 2 Rainforest, 2 Sandstone rocky, 2 Sandstone woodland, 2 Volcanic riparian (n=8) &ndash; alterate years</p>
<p>Drysdale River: 2 Sandstone rocky, 2 sandstone woodland, 2 Volcanic riparian (n=6) &ndash; alternate years</p>
<p>Analysis and reporting</p>
<p>Trends will be presented on abundance (trap success = number of animals caught/total number of trap nights per site) or vegetation cover measurements. If trends fall below threshold values (e.g. &lt;2 % projected foliage shrub cover or &lt;2 % mammal trap success) this will be reported. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test for differences between different habitats, fire regimes and cattle densities. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination will be used to characterize changes in species assemblages over time.</p>
<p>Timely feedback on biodiversity condition/status is a crucial component of an adaptive management program, as is publishing data to ensure credibility and quality control of data. Annual reporting and publishing of results will need significant blocks of time during the year, not just at the end of the field season. Time from the end of the field season in August, through to November when fire planning and reporting occurs, will be the period designated for annual analysis and report writing.</p>
<p>This report will be circulated within Science, Nature Conservation and Regional Services Divisions to ensure scrutiny of biodiversity outcomes.

3124,,"<p>The heath mouse <em>Pseudomys shortridgei</em> (50-80g) is one of several native rodent species that have declined in distribution and abundance since European colonisation. According to subfossil records, the species was once widely distributed across the heathlands of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. It now occurs in species-rich and structurally complex heathland and woodland in two disjunct areas in south-western Victoria, and extending across the border into South Australia, and in southern Western Australia. The main ecological difference between these widely separated populations appears to be related to fire regime. In WA, the species tends to occur in long unburnt habitat with highest densities recorded in vegetation 30 years post-fire. Whereas in Victoria, highest densities have been recorded in habitat 5-15 years after fire. While there is some disparity in studies investigating their genetic differentiation (Cooper et al. 2003; , they are currently treated as a single species.</p>
<p>Populations in Victoria are restricted to the Grampian State Forest, Lower Glenelg National Park, Bats Ridge Fauna Reserve, and Mount Eccles National Park (Ovington 1978; Cockburn 1980; Watts and Aslin 1981; Wells 1991; Meulman 1997). From 2002-2008, South Australian populations of the heath mouse were recorded in Honeysuckle and Dry Creek Native Forest Reserves, and Lower Glenelg River Conservation Park (Kemper et al. 2010). A single individual was also recorded from Kangaroo Island in 1967, though the species has not been detected since then (Robinson et al. 2000).</p>
<p>Originally collected in 1906 near Pingelly in WA&rsquo;s wheatbelt, the heath mouse was thought to be extinct in WA until its rediscovery in 1987. Since then, it has been recorded in low numbers within the Fitzgerald River National Park, Dragon Rocks Nature Reserve, Ravensthorpe Range (and nearby) and Lake Magenta Nature Reserve. Until 2019, the last confirmed record of heath mouse in WA was in 2004, from Lake Magenta. The heath mouse is listed as Endangered under the <em>EPBC</em> Act and Vulnerable under the WA <em>Biodiversity Conservation Act.</em></p>
<p>In WA, Quinlan et al. (2004) found that heath mice prefer long unburnt mixed laterite heath communities in Lake Magenta Nature Reserve. Sanders et al. (2012) found heath mice in shrub mallee with either a heath or scrub understorey on loamy-sand or sandy loam with a lateritic component. The vegetation at these sites was 30-70 years old, although capture rates were higher in younger vegetation (30 years). In the Ravensthorpe Range, they were captured in shrub mallee with a scrub understorey over sedges on loamy sand with laterite and sandy light clay on greenstone. Heath mice appear to follow a seasonal breeding pattern with adults surviving into successive years. At Lake Magenta females were pregnant in July, lactating in October and juveniles were present in the population in March-April (D. Cancilla pers. comm.).</p>
<p>The lack of recent heath mouse records in WA instigated targeted surveys for this species in May/June 2019, which resulted in their capture at two locations south of Ravensthorpe and an area in the Great Western Woodlands 80km south east of Hyden. This preliminary survey provided confidence that the heath mouse was still extant in WA, but further surveys in 2020 failed to detect the species despite sampling in areas where it had previously been recorded (i.e., Lake Magenta Nature Reserve, Fitzgerald River National Park and Ravensthorpe Range). In general, trap success across all sights was remarkably low, and was thought to be due to successive years of low rainfall across the area.</p>
<p>Although not thought to respond to changes in resource availability in a boom and bust dynamic, studies in the Grampians National Park in Victoria have shown a strong correlation between heath mouse abundance and rainfall. Here, abundance peaks following high rainfall events, and falls to very low densities during drought conditions (Senior 2014). This is also likely to be the case in WA, although the lack of long-term monitoring data makes this difficult to corroborate/discern.</p>
<p>As there is no recovery plan for the heath mouse, and there are clear indications of decline in distribution and abundance, further targeted survey is critically important to determine current conservation status. Given its low density and patchy distribution, developing a survey strategy that maximises the likelihood of detecting the species poses a challenge. Spatially explicit habitat suitability models based on historical records and relevant environmental data layers can assist but given the species appears to now be absent in many of the areas where it has been previously located, the reliability of such models is questionable. As annual rainfall has declined in south-west WA, and is predicted to decline further, projecting these models onto future climate scenarios may be useful for selecting survey locations in areas previously thought unsuitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should populations of the heath mouse be found, a decision then needs to be made regarding what management actions are required to protect the species and promote its recovery. In-situ actions alone may not be adequate if their abundance is determined to be critically low. In this case, establishing a captive breeding program may be an option, with the goal to produce enough founders for reintroduction back into the wild. One location which has been proposed for a heath mouse reintroduction is Dirk Hartog Island. Structured decision making is a useful process for making conservation management decisions including a consideration of both ex-situ and in-situ measures.</p>","<p>Undertake targeted surveys for the heath mouse to:</p>
<ul>
<li>establish their current range and conservation status in WA</li>
<li>identify populations that may be suitable for ongoing monitoring</li>
<li>assess the possibility of sourcing heath mice for a captive breeding colony to provide founders for reintroductions</li>
</ul>","<ul>
<li>An improved understanding of the distribution and abundance of heath mice to inform effective conservation management and recovery actions.</li>
<li>Identification of conservation management actions, including captive breeding and potential translocations, to establish sustainable populations of heath mice in the wild.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the unknown status of the heath mouse within their regions, both the South Coast and Wheatbelt have indicated a targeted survey of the heath mouse is a priority to determine conservation status and spatial distribution. This would inform targeting recovery actions and provide a baseline to determine population trends, revealing current and future management effectiveness. Targeted management activities aimed at recovering the species could include: fire management targeted at protecting and maintaining diverse and productive heath communities, introduced predator control reducing predation pressure on heath mouse populations by including Eradicat&reg; into the baiting program, <em>Phytophthora cinnamomi</em> management given many of the heathland species required to maintain habitat suitable for heath mice are susceptible to Pc, captive breeding/translocations to provide secure populations, and develop ongoing monitoring methods that identify trends in heath mouse populations (size and occupancy) along with predator activity. Firstly, within sites identified as containing heath mice and secondly in habitat identified as likely to contain heath mice.</p>","<p>Users: South Coast Regional PWS staff and Wheatbelt Regional PWS staff, BCS, Species and Communities, Western Shield</p>

<p>For the selection of survey sites in 2019, maps of potentially suitable habitat were generated by overlaying all heath mouse records on State Vegetation Association and Soil Type layers using GIS software. The following attributes were linked to most of the heath mouse capture locations.</p>
<p>Vegetation:</p>
<p>&bull; Mallee/Mallee-heath</p>
<p>&bull; Mallee-heath</p>
<p>&bull; Scrub-heath</p>
<p>Soils:</p>
<p>&bull; Felsic intrusives (74292)</p>
<p>&bull; Ferruginous duricrust (38498)</p>
<p>&bull; Pallinup Formation (14796)</p>
<p>&bull; Sand plain (38499)</p>
<p>All areas where the above vegetation associations and soil types coincided were mapped and then clipped using the current remnant vegetation layer to determine areas that maintained potentially suitable remnant native vegetation. Fire history mapping was then overlayed (using 5-year increments) to help eliminate areas that had recently been burnt and therefore would have a lower likelihood of heath mouse occurrence.</p>
<p>For future surveys, these maps will be compared to those generated using the habitat suitability model software Maxent projected on future climate scenarios (see below). Additionally, as the amount of rainfall received in 2020/21 was above average, some sites where the species has been previously recorded will also be resampled as per the 2020 survey.</p>
<p>Four broad sites will be surveyed &ndash; Lake Magenta Nature Reserve and Dragon Rocks Nature Reserve, Frank Hann National Park and surrounding UCL, Fitzgerald River National Park, and the UCL in the Fitzgerald Biosphere near Ravensthorpe and Kundip townsites and north of Cocanarup Timber Reserve.</p>
<p><strong>Trapping</strong></p>
<p>Elliott traps will be set in parallel lines of 10 traps (20 traps per site) placed approximately 25 m apart with 50m between lines. Traps will be baited with a mixture of peanut paste, oats and sultanas. All traps will be checked daily within 3 hours of sunrise. Trap grids will be run for five consecutive nights. At times it may be appropriate to use a transect survey design rather than a grid, i.e. when suitable habitat follows a linear feature such as a creekline or road. Transects will involve up to 50 trap sites placed ~50m apart.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat suitability modelling - Maxent</strong></p>
<p>A total of 43 presence records of heath mouse were utilised in the SDM. A 200km buffer was created around presence points to serve as a background region. In total, 87 environmental variables were used as candidate layers for the SDM. These environmental layers were sourced from the CSIRO, TERN, bccvl, WorldClim, Department of Agriculture, Water and Environment and Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. Environmental variables were realigned and forced to share a resolution of 30m. All processing was undertaken using R, and subsequent SDMs were performed using package SDMtune 1.1.3.</p>
<p>A post-hoc assessment using the fire history layers, as well as remnant vegetation, was also undertaken.</p>
<p>Both preliminary manual selection and a data-driven selection, using the SDMtune package, was undertaken to refine the number of environmental predictors used in the model. Data-driven selection using SDMtune removes highly correlated variables in a complex step wise process. Variables were ranked according to their percent contribution and a jack-knife test removed variables that decreased model performance the least, according to AUC.</p>
<p>Once the final model was created, it was used to predict the distribution of the species by incorporating future climate data. Future climate data, represented by BioClim variables, were taken from four global climate models with two shared socio-economic pathways each. Socio economic pathways refer to the relative severity of the global climate model. Best case scenario (ssp126) and worst-case scenario (ssp585) were used along with four different GCMs: CNRM-ESM2-1, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MIROC-ES2Land MRI-ESM2-0.</p>
<p><strong>Structured Decision Making</strong></p>
<p>The PACES tool: Planning and Assessment for Conservation through Ex-Situ management</p>
<p>The PACES tool is an Excel-based decision tool designed to support planning and assessment of ex-situ management for a threatened species. It can be used by a sole decision-maker, or in a collaborative workshop setting with a group of managers and/or experts. The tool facilitates a structured approach to the decision to initiate or continue ex-situ management of a species by comparing likely outcomes under ex-situ and in-situ management. Decisions made using a structured approach are more likely to achieve their objectives and can be defended and explained to others. The approach involves separating predictions (based on science or expert knowledge) from the evaluation of outcomes, thus enabling evidence-based decisions that can also account for differing stakeholder perspectives.</p>",granted,False,,granted,True,granted,"<ul>

The strength of this approach lies in the ability to cross-validate aspects of the vegetation theme data with land-use data and vice versa. It also ensures that derived data sets eg vegetation cover derived through intersecting vegetation map data with land use and vegetation cover data are reliable. The cross-validation and intersection requires that the data sets be comparable in terms of scale and accuracy.</p>
<p>This project also deals with the intensive and extensive land use regions differently according to the available data sources. Methodologies will be applied to different regions are described as follows.</p>
<p>1. Vegetation type - vegetation maps</p>
<p>For the pre-1750 Vegetation, this project will modify existing vegetation map database to conform with the proposed classification based on NVIS core attributes, and produce attributed linework for maps at a scale of 1:250,000 for the intensive land use regions. For the extensive land use regions, the project will first check existing vegetation map database against recent pastoral systems mapping and up-date as necessary. The final database will be modified to conform to the proposed classification based on NVIS core attributes, and produce attributed linework for a map at a scale of 1:1,000,000.</p>
<p>For present Vegetation, this project will intersect the two generated pre-1750 vegetation map data sets with the related land-use and vegetation cover data to produce attributed linework of present vegetation for a map at scales of 1:250,000 for the areas of intensive land use and 1:1,000,000 for the areas of extensive land use.</p>
<p>2. Vegetation Cover and Vegetation Condition</p>
<p>Intensive Land-use Zones: This project will work on two Intensive Land-use Zones for vegetation cover and vegetation condition. These are the Southwest Agricultural Region and the Ord Agricultural Area. However, the project methods for these two areas are different because of different data availability.</p>
<p>For the Southwest Agricultural Region, the project will commence with the collation of on-ground vegetation survey data that can be used to provide benchmarks of vegetation condition, and collation of data on land protected under the Remnant Vegetation Protection Scheme and Land for Wildlife scheme. Land-use data will also be used to identify Crown reserves and vacant Crown land where necessary.</p>
<p>Land Cover data will be used to enhance attribution of polygons of perennial vegetation, together with co-registered, rectified digital orthophotos.  Assuming non-perennial vegetation is agricultural crops and/or pasture. </p>
<p>On-ground vegetation survey data, orthophoto data and data on fencing/grazing and other land-use data as necessary, will be used to derive a condition/disturbance rating for each patch of remnant vegetation or sub-samples within each patch. These data sets will then be integrated to develop a first-approximation condition map for the Region. For all remnant vegetation throughout Region, check position in the landscape with SACRED data and assign an ""at Risk"" (from salinisation) rating. The final data sets will be validated by comparing land-use data with vegetation cover data.</p>
<p>For the Ord Agricultural Area, there may be some substantial change in vegetation cover and condition in the very near future as the Ord Stage II project gets underway. An opportunity exists to monitor the vegetation cover and condition changes closely using coverage of aerial photography at approximately 5-yearly intervals.  The changes can be reported against a 1:50,000 topographic map base prepared for the Ord Stage II project.</p>
<p>For Ord Stage I area, use recent aerial photography combined with the land-use data and to derive vegetation cover and condition map datasets. (Aerial photography will provide cross-validation of land-use data).</p>
<p>Extensive Land-use Zone: The extensive land-use zone includes the Pastoral Region, Crown reserves, and vacant Crown land</p>
<p>For pastoral lands, this project will collate data from a number of sources including rangelands survey condition rating data and/or pastoral condition report data where available, rangelands monitoring (WARMS) data, AgWA data on woody weeds, invasive annual grasses etc., AussieGRASS traverse data and data from local rangelands personnel. Other on-ground vegetation survey data for pastoral lands and all categories of Crown land will also be collated. </p>
<p>NDVI data will be used to identify those areas of the rangelands and adjacent Crown land where vegetation appears to be in good condition and also those areas where perennial vegetation cover appears to be greatly reduced. The assumption for the rangelands is continuous cover of native vegetation except where there are known irrigated horticultural projects or extensive mine developments etc (from land-use component) and where NDVI data suggest cover of perennial vegetation is greatly reduced. (It may be possible to develop a relationship between stocking rate data derived from land-use data set and vegetation cover and condition: this may emerge as the project proceeds).</p>
<p>All extensive vacant Crown land is assumed in moderate to good condition (except where there are extensive mining developments - derived from land-use component). (Parcels of Crown land within the Pastoral Region may have been subjected to grazing, so this assumption is unlikely to hold true).</p>
<p>Analyse on-ground survey and monitoring data, NDVI data and land-use ratings to give a first-approximation condition map for all pastoral lands and adjacent Crown lands, and other vacant Crown lands where data are available. (It may be possible to develop a relationship between stocking rate data derived from land-use data set and vegetation cover and condition: this may emerge as the project proceeds).</p>
<p>3. Land Use</p>
<p>The land use mapping will cover the whole state but the Intensive Land-use Zone (Southwest Agricultural Region and Ord Agricultural Region) and Extensive Land-use Zone (Pastoral Region including Crown reserves, and vacant Crown land) will be treated slightly differently. The project will:</p>
<p>- Complete definition of individual agricultural enterprises and geocode each property. Complete field coding of individual agricultural enterprises using the Western Australian Land Use Classification (WASLUC) Coding scheme.  </p>
<p>- Provide geo-coded agricultural enterprise data to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p>- Use ABS census data, industry-specific data and WASLUC data to rate each agricultural enterprises/property by degree of intensity of land-use.  Assign a WASLUC code or equivalent to each property for 1996/97.</p>
<p>- Integrate vegetation cover data and Crown reserves cadastres, data on mining activities to produce a comprehensive land-use map for the Region.</p>",required,False,<p>N/A</p>,not required,False,not required,"<p>The project will be conducted at the Spatial Resource Information Group, Ag WA using both ORACLE and integraph software.

1770,<p>The overarching aims and outcomes of this project are strongly aligned with current hydrological projects being undertaken within the Wetlands Conservation Program; SPP 2014-024 and SPP 2015-01</p>,"<p>Biodiversity conservation requires an understanding of ecological processes, including balances and fluxes of water, energy and the biogeochemistry.&nbsp; Where there is limited information on these processes, it is difficult to develop robust predictions on how ecosystems will respond to change and therefore develop management responses.&nbsp; This is of concern particularly as changes to hydrology and water quality have been identified as one of the main threats to water dependent ecosystems in Western Australia (Department of Environment and Conservation 2006), including Ramsar wetlands, recovery catchment wetlands, many Threatened Ecological Communities and other high value wetlands identified in Regional Nature Conservation Plans.</p>
<p>A number of frameworks have been developed to help understand the hydrological function of water dependent ecosystems.&nbsp; Most coarse-scale classifications broadly group ecosystems on the basis of their physical settings and type, linked to their responsiveness and dominant water source reliance (e.g. Davis et al 2013).&nbsp; These frameworks are an important resource that underpins broad-scale (e.g. bio-regional, state and nationwide) investigations and coarse-scale numerical models. They also assist the development of high level policies and management actions.&nbsp; However, to manage ecosystems at finer scales, researchers have identified a need to understand hydrological variation, in particular the vertical and lateral connectivity of water sources, sediment structure and the systems&rsquo; sensitivity to change (see, for example, Grundling 2014, Kettridge et al 2014, Friedman and Fryirs 2015, Robinson et al 2015, and Marino et al. 2016).</p>
<p>Numerous site-specific, fine scale hydrological frameworks have also been constructed to assist in managing ecosystems at local scales and prioritising on-ground actions.&nbsp; Their success has been dependent on the collection of sufficient data and information that permits the development of integrated models capable of predicting hydrologic partitioning across space and time. That requires detailed spatio-temporal studies of multiple parameters, including climate, landscapes, groundwater and surface water interactions, physico-chemical hydrological variation, emerging properties and anthropogenic induced hydrological change (Richardson et al 2011, Bertrand et al 2012, Larnad and Datry 2013 and Bertrand et al 2014).&nbsp; Researching all ecological parameters requires the engagement of scientists from different sub-disciplines.&nbsp; This can be difficult to achieve and arguably has delayed the development of effective finer-scale management frameworks and research outcomes which are accessible to water and land managers.&nbsp; To address this global problem, a research network of <em>critical zone</em> (CZ - extending from the top of the canopy to the base of groundwater) observatories has been established in a number of countries to improve understanding and better communicate the science in the Earths&rsquo; most hydrodynamic and biochemically active zone (Lin 2010 and Lin et al 2015).&nbsp; Researchers from different hydrology sub-disciplines are now working with physical and ecological scientists on complementary datasets to reassess hydrological process and to develop conceptual and numerical models that will help better manage this zone.</p>
<p>Results of the CZ research conducted to-date have significantly enhanced our understanding of connectivity (also known as coupling, with the converse being partitioning and compartmentalisation) and the physico-chemical sensitivity of CZ hydrological systems. &nbsp;For example, Brooks et al (2015) identified that an improved knowledge of the biogeophysical structure of the CZ helped constrain rainfall partitioning (e.g. water storages, routing and residence time), that are critical inputs to attaining robust predictive hydrodynamic climate and landuse change models.&nbsp; Functional biodiversity research by Kusel and others (2016) demonstrated that connectivity between the near and subsurface occurs, and can be traced vertically through changes in aquifer chemistry and microbial community compositions. They recommend future work requiring the use of specific bacteriophages (phages) as tracers to improve understanding how organisms and genetic information is transported through the CZ.&nbsp; Geophysical and geochemical methods have both proved successful in mapping CZ fine scale variation in water quality storages and fluxes (inferred fluxes with respect to geophysical methods) (Parsekian et al 2015 and Shand et al 2016).</p>
<p>The application of geochemistry and environmental tracers in mound spring environments has resolved the localised fine scale hydrochemical processes that partition different water qualities during spring water discharge and help create the unique mound spring ecosystems (Love et al 2013).&nbsp; Advances in numerical modelling, using Reactive Transport Models (RTMs), has followed and allowed for an improved understanding of CZ processes through developing <em>fit for purpose</em> fine-scale, process-based, models.&nbsp; These are capable of modelling the complexity of these natural, nonlinear coupled earth systems (e.g. suitable to model interactions among roots, micro-organisms, carbon, water, minerals, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, elemental concentration, speciation, and isotope data) and as a consequence increase confidence that modelling outputs are pertinent to the environment and can be used to develop sound management actions (Li et al 2016).</p>
<p>This relatively recent establishment of CZ research laboratories focused on understanding fine scale ecological processes is of great value to biodiversity researchers and managers as it confirms that local scale investigations are essential. It also provides a resource where the latest methods and published results (that deliver information on sensitive hydrological and hydrochemical parameters of different water dependent ecosystems), can be sourced.&nbsp; Combining this information helps fast track hydrological investigations, which is of particular benefit for hydrological work undertaken in DPaW, not least as most hydrological questions relating to water dependent ecosystems tend to arise when a change to the hydrology is proposed or under way (e.g. urban development, agriculture expansion and mining), and there is limited time and budget to undertake spatio-temporal investigations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The overarching aim of this project is develop hydrological function investigations, at appropriate scales, of key water dependent ecosystems which improve our understanding of critical processes and provide enough information to assess their physico-chemical sensitivity and likely responses to change.&nbsp; This meets objectives outlined in the 2006 Department of Environment and Conservation 100-year Biodiversty Conservation Strategy for Western Australia, specifically, to maximise scientific research that improves knowledge of biodiversity and ecological processes, integrates research with management requirements and improves predictions of changes in hydrology as a threatening process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most proposed hydrological changes to water dependent ecosystems alter the water budget and fluxes, which have consequence for water quality and soil chemistry.&nbsp; To understand if the predicted changes are acceptable, information on hydrological connectivity and the physico-chemical sensitivity is required.&nbsp; This can be achieved within a limited time frame and budget if fine scale work is undertaken at &lsquo;type&rsquo; locations. Study sites need to be selected to both optimise the transferability of hydrological results and outcomes to other areas. &nbsp;If the work is carried out with other DPaW officers it ensures that hydrological results are integrated with other biophysical data and information, to the benefit of the Department&rsquo;s stated objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the approach currently being followed in three &lsquo;type&rsquo; locations, as detailed below. This project has been developed to bring short-term hydrological function assessment studies under one umbrella project.</p>
<p><u>Walyarta (Mandora Marsh) mound springs TEC resilience study (6/2015 to 6/2017)</u></p>
<p>A change to the hydrology through increased groundwater abstraction has been identified as a potential threat to the sustainability of the Walyarta mound springs (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2016) - a State-listed threatened ecological community (TEC).&nbsp; This study will be carried out over two years and due to the lack of hydrological infrastructure, will focus on applying novel methods to determine the vertical hydrological connectivity of the springs with different aquifers, as well as assess vertical and lateral hydrogeochemical gradients that control groundwater and spring substrate geochemistry.&nbsp; Water level and quality data loggers (surface water and groundwater) will be installed at Eil Eil spring to collect high resolution data to help understand the role of the hydrology in maintaining the unique invertebrate community (Quinlan et al 2016).</p>
<p><u>Assessment of the hydrological function of the Brixton Street wetland complex (12/2015 to 6/2017)</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Brixton Street wetlands are located within the Swan Coastal Plain and contain a number of clay pans that are State and federally-listed TECs, and also contain rare and endangered flora.&nbsp; The number of clay pans in the Plain has greatly diminished in number, the occurrences are fragmented and the condition of many is under threat due to them being located on the margins of urban environments where anthropogenic structures have changed the volume and quality of surface and groundwater flows (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2015).&nbsp; This project will be carried out over eighteen months and involves an initial desktop study followed by the design of a field program with other DPaW scientists and officers to collect surface water observations and install groundwater monitoring bores to assess surface water and groundwater connectivity and quality.</p>
<p><u>Swan Estuary Marine Park - Lucky Bay hydrogeological investigation (6/2016 to 6/2017)</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent analyses of nutrients in seagrass identified high concentrations in grasses sampled from Lucky Bay, within the Alfred Cove area of the Swan Estuary (Department of Water 2015). &nbsp;This report suggests groundwater is the likely source due to previous hydrogeological investigations in the 1980&rsquo;s discovering that groundwater nutrient concentrations in the Applecross and Attadale areas were elevated from the leakage of effluent from septic tanks, application of high levels of fertiliser and/or the leaching of nutrient rich contaminants from landfill.&nbsp; The area is known to contain landfill and the main aim of this project is to map the thickness of the Superficial aquifer discharging groundwater into Lucky Bay and to determine if landfill changes the direction and rates of groundwater flow and delivery of nutrients.&nbsp; The hydrogeological investigation will be designed in collaboration with DPaW Rivers and Estuaries scientists to ensure that data collected is aligned with the seagrass sampling sites to allow for the integration of biophysical datasets in the final report.</p>
<p><u>Future projects</u></p>
<p>A number of other projects have been identified in the Kimberley Region where we have limited understanding of the hydrological function of many water dependent ecosystems (e.g. State and federally listed monsoon vine thickets MVT and State-listed northern Kimberley mound springs TECs) (see Barrett and English in prep) in areas where there is increasing pressure on developing water and land for pastoralism, mining and energy.&nbsp; Objectives of new projects will vary, but the key aims will follow those addressed above; that is to develop appropriate scale hydrological function investigations of water dependent ecosystems that improve our understanding of key processes and provide enough information to assess their physico-chemical sensitivity and likely responses to change, and help guide future management.</p>","<p>Project outputs are intended to provide a basis for more informed decision making with respect to prioritising conservation actions and assessing environmental impacts of land and water use proposals. &nbsp;By reducing hydrological knowledge gaps this project will help build an improved, statewide understanding of the ecohydrology of TECs, and other ecosystems under threat and their critical hydrological parameters, helping secure their future in an environment of change.</p>
<p>Outcomes from current projects are detailed below:</p>
<p><u>Walyarta (Mandora Marsh) mound springs TEC resilience study (6/2015 to 6/2017)</u></p>
<p>The outputs of this work will provide a basis on which to interpret the potential impacts of water resource development in the associated aquifers. The outcome will be more informed management approaches to assist in the preservation of elements of a critical ecosystem and information will be included in the recovery plan for the TEC.</p>
<p><u>Assessment of the hydrological function of the Brixton Street wetland complex (12/2015 to 6/2017)</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To-date this work has seen preliminary surface water and hydrochemical data being used to develop a track remediation plan on DPaW estate and provide advice on the potential environmental impact of developing land within this locality (areas of Guildford Clay Formation on the Swan Coastal Plain). &nbsp;The outcome of the study will be management that will reduce the development induced environmental impacts on TECs, other significant ephemeral wetlands, and threatened flora located within the Swan Coastal Plain.</p>
<p><u>Swan Estuary Marine Park - Lucky Bay hydrogeological investigation (6/2016 to 6/2017)</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main outcome of this study will be increased confidence in the development of management actions in the Lucky Bay area of the Swan Estuary Marine Park due to an improved understanding of dynamics of the connected shallow aquifer system.</p>
<p><u>Future projects</u></p>
<p>Over time the incorporation of results from multiple projects will provide data, information and knowledge to help develop a fine scale hydrological framework that assists the management of ecosystems at local scale and the prioritisation of on-ground actions.</p>","<p>Internal and external stakeholders will be identified at the inception of individual studies to ensure knowledge transfer commences at the outset, from the investigation design through to the integration with other biophysical data and information.&nbsp; Studies will be developed and undertaken collaboratively with a multi-disciplinary team of scientific researchers and specialists from universities, government departments and DPaW to maximise the opportunity for the publication of results and communication of outcomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Walyarta (Mandora Marsh) mound springs TEC resilience study (6/2015 to 6/2017)</u></p>
<p>Research results will be delivered through the production of three reports, a DPaW information sheet and a journal and/or conference publication. The latter will be produced from the third and final DPaW report which will integrate interpreted results from datasets (remote sensing data, hydrochemistry and environmental tracers and geophysics (airborne electromagnetics)) collected during the two year project. Information and recommendations will be included in the recovery plan for the TEC.</p>
<p><u>Assessment of the hydrological function of the Brixton Street wetland complex (12/2015 to 6/2017)</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigation results will be delivered through the production of three DPaW reports and a DPaW information sheet and a conference publication. Information and recommendations will be included in future updates of the recovery plan for the claypans, and recovery plans for other TECs that occur in the Greater Brixton St Wetlands.</p>
<p><u>Swan Estuary Marine Park - Lucky Bay hydrogeological investigation (6/2016 to 6/2017)</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hydrogeological investigation results will be included in a DPaW Rivers and Estuaries report, a DPaW information sheet and a conference publication.</p>
<p><u>Future projects</u></p>
<p>It is anticipated that future hydrological function studies will produce a minimum of one DPaW report and information sheet and a conference publication. Where relevant to TECs, information and recommendations will be included in future recovery plans (eg for the North Kimberley mound springs TEC).</p>","<p><a title=""Hydrological Function 3yr workplan"" href=""T:\530-Wetlands Conservation Program\Shared Data\WCP HYDROLOGY\Other_Projects\SPP\Tasks&amp;Milestones"">T:\530-Wetlands Conservation Program\Shared Data\WCP HYDROLOGY\Other_Projects\SPP\Tasks&amp;Milestones</a></p>","<p>Barrett M and English V (in prep) A flora and vegetation survey of the North Kimberley mound springs, Mt Elizabeth Station.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach for each project will initially involve a thorough review of available literature (including recent CZ research), an assessment of existing biophysical data, followed by the development, or updating, of the conceptual hydrological model to determine the key research parameters.&nbsp; Where further data is required, investigation(s) will be designed, in consultation with stakeholders, ensuring they match timeframes, available skillsets and budgets.&nbsp; Physico-chemical data collected will be interpreted to define empirical relationships and to develop conceptual models primarily for assessing hydrological connectivity (e.g. soil mineralogy and elemental relationships, moisture, bulk density and texture, water age, quality and movement).&nbsp; The collection of spatio-temporal data will enable the development of more complex conceptual and numerical models to assess physico-chemical sensitivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This methodology is being observed in the two current projects detailed below.&nbsp; Both projects have completed the data collection phase, and the data interpretation phase has commenced.</p>
<p><u>Walyarta (Mandora Marsh) mound springs TEC resilience study (6/2015 to 6/2017)</u></p>
<p>A review of relevant literature has been completed, with the investigation scale and key research issues identified. Data acquisition, processing and interpretation of multi-temporal remote sensing data has been completed, and relevant hydrochemistry and environmental tracer data required were determined. Other major tasks undertaken have involved the reprocessing and interpretation of geological information resolvable in geophysical (airborne electromagnetic) data, and the conduct of two field programs to collect mound spring hydrochemistry and environmental tracer data.&nbsp; The November 2016 field program also involved installing water level and quality data loggers (surface water and groundwater) at Eil Eil spring to collect high resolution temporal data to help understand the role of the hydrology in maintaining the unique invertebrate community (Quinlan et al 2016).</p>
<p><u>Assessment of the hydrological function of the Brixton Street wetland complex (12/2015 to 6/2017)</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A literature review/desktop study and data sourcing project was undertaken and a strawman conceptual hydrological model developed.&nbsp; An investigation was then planned in consultation with internal stakeholders to align a planned surface water and groundwater monitoring program with areas associated with threatened flora. Surface water observation sites and groundwater monitoring bores were installed to assess surface water and groundwater connectivity.&nbsp; Connectivity will be assessed through an interpretation of surface water levels, regolith-soil chemistry and high resolution groundwater level data from data loggers.</p>

702,"1999/0010 Seed biology, seedbank dynamics and collection and storage of seed of rare and threatened Western Australian taxa
","Climate directly influences the distribution, abundance and health of plant populations by affecting plant traits that regulate the timing of biological activities (Walter et al 2002, Parmesan and Yohe 2003, Root et al. 2003). Sensitivity to climate change for a given species will depend on its ecological niche and geographic distribution (Broennimann et al. 2006), life-history characteristics and genetic and phenotypic plasticity (Aitken et al. 2008).  Most species can tolerate some short-term variability in climate through phenotypic plasticity, although recent responses to global warming have generally involved shifts in either seasonality (Jump and Peñuelas 2005; Bradshaw and Holzapfel 2008), or for alpine species, altitude (Gworek et al. 2006; Parolo and Rossi 2008), rather than the shifts in thermal tolerance that would be necessary for long-term persistence. The most vulnerable species to a warming climate will be those with restricted niches, those in regions with high anomalies in climate or those with barriers to migration such as in fragmented habitats (Broennimann et al 2006; Malcolm et al 2006). Plants with limited dispersal ability and slow reproductive rate are also likely to be threatened, and species already restricted to the physical limits of their range, like higher latitudes and upper montane locations, are presumed with some certainty to be at risk of extinction (Walther et al. 2002; Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Root et al. 2003). If species cannot tolerate or adapt to changed conditions or migrate to more suitable sites, it is with some certainty that they will go extinct. 

Climatic variables influence reproductive traits such as fecundity, seed germination, seed longevity and seedling growth (Fenner and Thompson 2005). Although soil moisture availability is critical for seedling emergence and survival, temperature is arguably the most important climatic variable since it synchronises germination to environmental conditions most suitable for seedling establishment, e.g. high likelihood of adequate water availability (Bell 1994; Fenner and Thompson 2005). Temperature affects seed responses through regulating germination rate in non-dormant seeds and dormancy loss in both dry and moist seeds (Probert 1992).

In south west Western Australia there is some uncertainty about the ability of many plant species to persist under future climate scenarios which predict rising temperatures and declining rainfall. These climatic changes have the potential to impact on the region’s extraordinary plant diversity and ecosystems. There are suggestions that an almost total collapse of flora endemic to the south west of Western Australia will occur (Hughes et al. 1996; Pouliquen-Young and Newman 2000; Malcolm et al. 2006; Fitzpatrick et al. 2008; Yates et al. 2010) under projected climate change scenarios.
","<p>The main aim of this SPP is to investigate temperature thresholds for germination for species across climatic and altitudinal gradients in the south west of Western Australia. We know that species have climate preferences, but our knowledge of basic physiological tolerances is lacking for most native species. Germination is one of the fundamental biological activities vital to persistence in obligate seeding species, and assessing direct physiological constraints on recruitment, for example the upper and lower germination temperature limits for germination, provides data on recruitment potential, with germination sub-optimal or inhibited below or above certain temperatures. Species are generally distributed in a particular environmental gradient with seed germination characteristics likely to be adapted to that particular set of conditions most suitable for their germination and growth. The temperature at which highest germination occurs in the shortest possible time is the optimum temperature for germination and provides some indication of the ideal conditions under which a population might successfully recruit and persist in the environment. The competitive balance between species is affected by the time of germination and emergence with delayed emergence often disadvantageous to growth and survival as competition for microsites, nutrients, water and light increases. As droughts become more severe under the predicted warming and drying trend for the region the timing of germination will become more crucial as available moisture becomes limited. </p>","<p>In fire-prone environments such as south west Western Australia studying the variation in plant traits known to respond to specific environmental stresses such as temperature may assist our understanding of the impact of warming temperatures on the persistence of plant species at the limits of their geographic range. Through screening of plant seed response to changes in temperatures we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve our knowledge and understanding of germination processes,</li>
<li>assist in the identification of potentially ‘at risk’ plant species,</li>
<li>use this knowledge to maximise successful restoration and reintroduction,</li>
<li>use this data as a basis for developing management response options and</li>
<li>use this data for modelling impacts of climate change on “at risk’ species.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is in keeping with DEC’s Corporate Plan to lead climate change actions and conserve biodiversity. This project will develop and improve knowledge and understanding of germination processes for native species, informing on how climate change may affect the survival of plant diversity in Western Australia.</p>
<p>In the context of the Science Division Strategic Plan, this project will undertake research to improve understanding of threats to biodiversity from climate warming. It will expand the research capability of the Division by building strategic partnerships with external partners such as the Millennium Seed Bank Project UK.</p>","<p>Knowledge gained from this research will be used by scientists working in climate change research as well as those working in flora management, conservation and recovery both within and external to DEC.

2350,<p>Marine Monitoring Program (SPP 2012-008)</p>,"<p>Seagrasses are foundation species that support important ecosystem services and processes (Ellison et al., 2005; Nordlund et al., 2017; Orth et al., 2006). For example, seagrasses provide food and habitat for fauna that support tourism and fisheries, detritus and nutrient subsidies, water quality maintenance, storing of organic carbon, and sediment accretion and stabilization (York et al. 2018; Unsworth, Nordlund, and Cullen-Unsworth 2018). Some of the largest and most diverse seagrass meadows in the world occur in Western Australia (WA); the warm south-flowing Leeuwin current amplifies the distribution of tropical genera (e.g. <em>Halophila</em> and <em>Halodule</em>) to intermix with temperate genera (e.g. <em>Posidonia</em> and <em>Amphibolis</em>). These meadows support many commercially, recreationally and culturally important fauna, such as blue swimmer crabs, dugong, herring, King George whiting, tailor, tarwhine, tiger prawns, snapper, sea turtles, western blue groper, western rock lobster and various cephalopods (Cappo, Alongi, Williams, &amp; Duke, 1998; Heck, Hays, &amp; Orth, 2003; Heithaus, 2004; Jernakoff, 1987; Kenyon, Loneragan, &amp; Hughes, 1995).</p>
<p>Seagrass meadows are however declining globally (~110 km<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), and anthropogenic related pressures such as terrestrial run-off, anchor damage, eutrophication and dredging are threatening the ecological, economic and social services that seagrass meadows provide (Waycott et al. 2009). For example, poor water quality caused by discharge of industrial waste, combined with harbour construction, resulted in the loss of approximately 1587 ha of seagrass in Cockburn Sound from 1967-1972 (Cambridge and McComb 1984; Kendrick et al. 2002), which is yet to fully recover even though water quality has since improved (Mohring and Rule 2013). Another key pressure globally and across WA is climate change; increased sea water temperature and extreme events (e.g. marine heat waves) have induced significant declines in seagrass cover in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area (Nowicki et al. 2017). An estimated 90% reduction in <em>A. antarctica </em>meadows occurred around the Peron Peninsula in response to the marine heat wave of 2010/11 (Thomson et al. 2015). The full extent of seagrass loss in WA&rsquo;s largest World Heritage Area since this marine heat wave is unknown. However, current estimates for seagrass loss for 68% of the Shark Bay Marine Park area between 2002-2014 are equivalent to approximately 60,000 ha (Holmes et al., 2019). Seagrass loss associated with the marine heat wave coincided with sea turtle starvation (Thomson et al. 2015), a collapse in the Shark Bay scallop (<em>Amusium balloti</em>) fishery (Caputi et al. 2016) and an estimated release of 9 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> from the sediment (Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018).</p>
<p>As the condition of seagrass meadows respond readily to environmental and anthropogenic pressure, they are used as indicators for the overall effectiveness of management (Key Performance Indicators) across several WA marine reserves managed by the Department of Biodiversity of Conservation and Attractions (DBCA). The long-term monitoring of seagrasses by the Marine Science Program (MSP) and Region staff helps to provide a greater understanding of changes in seagrass condition in response to pressure within each marine reserve. However, across-region comparisons and thorough temporal assessments of seagrass condition need to be compiled and assessed to gain a broader appreciation of seagrass health among the state&rsquo;s network of marine reserves.</p>
<p>Like seagrass, finfish communities have a strong economic and social value, and as such, are used as indicators of marine biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide (Pratchett, Hoey, and Wilson 2014). While the MSP long-term monitoring program conducts an effective finfish program designed to detect impacts associated mainly with fishing pressure, surveys are focussed around high diversity rocky and coral reefs. The efficacy of these methods in WA seagrass meadows are however unknown, and as a consequence monitoring does not currently assess the condition of seagrass associated fish assemblages. Nonetheless seagrasses cover extensive areas of the states marine reserves, providing food and habitat for many fish (and other fauna). Identifying appropriate techniques to survey fish in seagrass meadows will improve understanding of the dynamics and condition of faunal assemblages associated with this habitat.</p>
<p>A wide range of sampling methods are used to determine faunal assemblages (Short and Coles 2001), for example, invertebrate and finfish assemblages have been surveyed using seine nets, beam and otter trawls, crab scrapes, and diver observations along transects or within randomly placed quadrats (McNeill and Bell 1992; MacArthur and Hyndes 2001). Finfish sampling methods commonly include underwater visual census (Caldwell 2011), or underwater videos (Parker et al., 1994), either operated by a diver or placed as remote videos, which can be baited (Hardinge et al. 2013) or unbaited (Watson et al. 2010). Determining the optimal technique for sampling faunal assemblages will depend on the type of data required and the habitat being surveyed.</p>
<p>The composition of faunal assemblages is dynamic as communities are influenced by ecological processes that vary across multiple scales. For sedentary taxa, the condition of surrounding habitat can be an important determinant of local diversity and abundance (Wilson et al. 2006). Seascape metrics such as habitat composition, patch size, edge-to-patch size ratio, depth, distance to adjacent habitats as well as level of fragmentation can have a strong influence on faunal assemblages (Connolly 1994; Hyndes et al. 2018; Travers and Potter 2002). Structurally complex habitats such as seagrass meadows often form part of a mosaic of interconnected coastal habitats (e.g. mangrove, reefs, saltmarshes), that support a range of transient and resident fauna. Studies should therefore consider the effect of both seascape and local habitat factors on fish assemblages (van Lier et al. 2018; Connolly and Hindell 2006).</p>
<p>Within-patch seascape metrics such as seagrass structural complexity (i.e. aboveground biomass, canopy height, leaf morphology and epiphyte abundance) also influence fish and invertebrate assemblages within meadows (Edgar &amp; Robertson, 1992; Gartner, Tuya, Lavery, &amp; McMahon, 2013; Orth et al., 1984). For example, both the structural complexity of different seagrass species and the presence of algal epiphytes are known to influence macro-invertebrate density (Gartner et al. 2013). The prominent type of seagrass can also influence local structural complexity with consequences for both invertebrate (Jernakoff and Nielsen 1998) and fish assemblages (Hyndes, Kendrick, MacArthur, &amp; Stewart, 2003; Travers &amp; Potter, 2002). While these studies demonstrate that fish and invertebrate assemblages are influenced by the structural complexity of persistent seagrass genera (e.g. <em>Posidonia</em>), assessments among meadows with different seascape metrics (i.e. patch size, edge-to-patch size ratio, distance to adjacent habitats), temperate and tropical meadows (e.g. <em>H. uninervis</em>) or macroalgae (e.g. <em>Sirophysalis trinodis</em>) are lacking in WA. However, studies elsewhere indicate that patchy meadows have lower species richness compared to non-fragmented meadows (Macreadie et al. 2009). Such comparison are critical for understanding the future of seagrass assemblages, because as tropicalization ensues, the southerly contraction of temperate <em>P. australis</em> and <em>A. antarctica</em> will likely lead to their replacement by tropical seagrasses and macroalgae from sub-tropical regions like Shark Bay (Hyndes et al. 2016). An increased prevalence of the colonizing species <em>H. uninervis</em> post marine heat wave in Shark Bay indicates that tropicalization may be underway (Nowicki et al. 2017); but how this transition will affect faunal assemblages is unknown.</p>
<p>Clearly the taxonomic composition and physical structure of seagrasses vary spatially and, in some places, is in a state of change. As a consequence, the ecological role and conservation value of seagrass meadows is likely to vary both spatially and temporally. Identifying the seascape and within patch characteristics of seagrass meadows important to fish, and understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation to biodiversity is therefore essential for effective management of seagrass meadows and associated communities. Accordingly, the overarching aim of this project is to increase our understanding of the ecology of different types of seagrass meadows, providing insight into the effect of spatial and temporal differences, which then can lead to inferring effects of shifts in seagrass condition on ecosystem services.</p>",<p>Three key objectives have been identified to improve understanding of the ecology of different seagrass meadows: 1) describe seagrass distribution and condition over time across the sub-tropical/temperate WA marine reserves; 2) establish appropriate methods for surveying and monitoring faunal communities in seagrass meadows; and 3) assess faunal communities in different types of seagrass meadows across the seascape to inform how key ecosystem services are affected by pressures that impact seagrass condition.</p>,"<p><u>Objective 1</u>: The first objective will combine information collected by the DBCA marine monitoring program and external collaborators to provide an overview of seagrass condition in temperate WA marine reserves. Specifically, it will provide estimates of natural variability in seagrass condition over time, which can then be used to detect any abrupt or gradual changes outside of normal variation. The project will also specifically examine how extreme temperature in 2011 altered seagrass cover at Shark Bay, identifying resilient areas and metrics (e.g. similar to Degree Heating Weeks used in coral research) for predicting the effects of heat stress on seagrass. Useful products created out of this work include seagrass distribution maps, estimates of temporal and spatial rates of change, and digital habitat databases across the entire World Heritage Area; all of which can be used as quick reference guides on seagrass meadow condition. It is anticipated that the seagrass distribution maps and estimates of temporal and spatial rates of change in seagrass in Shark Bay following the marine heat wave (2010/11) will form the basis of publications in peer reviewed international journals.</p>
<p><u>Objective 2</u>: The second objective will provide information regarding the diversity and abundance of invertebrate and finfish assemblages in seagrass meadows in a subset of marine reserves whilst also determining which survey techniques are most appropriate for monitoring these assemblages. This will include collaboration amongst MSP and Regional staff, both having the opportunity to be exposed to and/or become more experienced in using a range of fauna community assessment methods in addition to learning more about the general biodiversity within each region. Additionally, stable isotope and gut contents analysis will help elucidate the trophic nature of fauna and the extent to which they rely on seagrass habitats. The results from this work will also be suitable for publication, one paper comparing fauna assemblage methods, and another focussed on the food web dynamics. Results from the methodological comparison will determine which methods are most appropriate to use in the third objective.</p>
<p><u>Objective 3</u>: Models assessing relationships between faunal communities and attributes of seagrass meadows (seascape and local), will identify which meadows are important in terms of fish biodiversity, important ecological functions and juvenile nursery grounds. By comparing faunal assemblages across impacted and stable seagrass meadows in Shark Bay, we will assess the ecological impact of meadow fragmentation and loss, potentially identifying resilient meadows. The results will also explore how ecological processes (e.g. herbivory) and ecosystem services (fisheries/ tourism) associated with fish assemblages vary among meadows of different composition. The results could be used to identify and conserve meadows with for maintaining healthy fish communities. Important seascape predictors of seagrass condition may also be used for planning in areas other than Shark Bay, to identify priority meadows for conservation. Similarly, information on seascape and local metrics can be used to refine monitoring efforts, improving our ability to evaluate management of coastal ecosystems. It is anticipated that one to two publications will be produced from this work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","<p>This project will predominantly benefit DBCA, especially those responsible for assessing and managing marine parks where seagrass is identified as an ecological asset in management plans. Information on important seascape predictors of seagrass condition and ecological value will be of use to park planners, and those interested in protecting seagrass from local anthropogenic impacts e.g. dredging. Information can be used to inform management decisions and feed into monitoring programs. Additionally, inclusion of regional staff in field work will facilitate knowledge transfer, and project outcomes will be transferred directly to all relevant DBCA Region/District staff in the form of information sheets and presentations. We estimate that the research findings will be published in peer reviewed journals to ensure knowledge transfer to researchers and managers nationally and internationally. The work may also be shared with the research community via conference presentations if the appropriate opportunity arises. Findings from the project will be communicated to the public in the form of newsletters (e.g. Landscope), social media (e.g. Facebook) and public lectures.&nbsp;</p>","<p>&nbsp;</p>

Kendrick, and Peter J. Ralph, 541&ndash;75. Springer International Publishing.</p>","<p><strong>Objective 1: </strong></p>
<p>To assess seagrass extent and condition in several marine reserves, a range of <em>in situ</em> and remote sensing data will be used:</p>
<p>(i) Seagrass habitat maps will be used to calculate change in seagrass extent in marine reserves. The priority will be to complete mapping the change in seagrass extent in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area to determine how much loss occurred in response to the 2010/11 marine heat wave. Previous assessments of seagrass loss are based on comparisons of maps of the Marine Park from 2002 and 2014. We will extend coverage of maps to include all of the World Heritage Area (including the entire Wooramel Bank) and develop maps for 2010 and 2016 to gain a better estimate of loss attributable to the 2011 heat wave. Shark Bay Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data will be used to identify which metrics of heat stress best predict seagrass change (i.e. loss and gain). To do this, daily SST (&deg;C) data from 1985-2017 will be downloaded from NOAA (https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/v3.1/) and extracted per 5x5 km pixel in order to correlate high resolution SST data to correlate spatial differences in seagrass extent across the Shark Bay region before, after and during the 2010/11 Marine Heat Wave (MHW). This will be analysed using a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) with a full subsets analysis (Fisher et al. 2018) and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) to identify which variable (or a combination variables) of heat stress best explains changes in seagrass cover. Additionally, this approach will enable us to develop a set of SST metrics that best explains (or helps predict) change in seagrass condition in other marine reserves.</p>
<p>(ii) &nbsp;Seagrass shoot density and % cover data from insitu surveys on transects carried out as part of the DBCA marine monitoring program will be used to assess condition over time within and across Ngari Capes Marine Park, Marmion Marine Park, Shoalwater Islands Marine Park, Jurien Bay Marine Park and Shark Bay Marine Park. These data will also be combined with data from external collaborators (including data from outside of marine reserves) and be will be used as part of a latitudinal assessment of seagrass meadows across WA. For example, we will assess how seagrass variables (e.g. <em>Posidonia </em>spp. shoot density or % cover) vary spatially and temporally to determine whether seagrass density (i.e. an indicator of meadow condition) differs across WA (within, and outside of marine reserves) and which areas are likely to be experiencing declines or changes in composition (i.e. &lsquo;tropicalization&rsquo;). To assess this, a statistical analysis approach might include modelling how variables such as latitude, region (marine reserve), site depth, time of year sampled, sea surface temperature etc. influence seagrass metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 2: </strong></p>
<p>To determine appropriate methods for assessing fish in seagrass meadows, data will be collected across three locations (Ngari Capes, Shoalwater Islands and Shark Bay Marine Park), at four sites per location with five sampling replicates at each, using five different sampling techniques:</p>
<p>(i) Beam trawl - Beam trawls have previously been used to obtain a robust understanding of diversity and abundance of faunal assemblages in seagrass meadows (McNeill and Bell 1992, McNeill and Fairweather 1993). A beam trawl measuring 1m wide x 0.5m high with 10mm mesh will be used to collect fishes at each site.&nbsp; The trawl will be towed at a constant speed (~0.4 m/s) for 50m and five replicate tows will be conducted per site at five sites, ensuring no overlap of area occurs. The fauna samples will be collected, frozen and the abundance, length, and gut contents and stable isotope tissue samples will be later analysed in the laboratory.</p>
<p>(ii) Underwater visual census (UVC) &ndash; Divers who are knowledgeable about the fish community in each marine reserve will survey five replicate 50m belt transects at each of the five sites. Surveys will only be conducted within a minimum water visibility of 5m.&nbsp; Size and abundance of all species within the transect will be recorded insitu with pencil and slate and data later transferred to a database. Similar procedures have been widely used to survey finfish communities throughout Australia (Halford and Thompson 1994, Holmes et al. 2013).</p>
<p>(iii) Diver operated stereo-video (DOV) &ndash; Divers will use mounted stereo-DOV units (consisting of high definition Sony HG21 digital video cameras) to survey finfish communities along five replicate 50m belt transects at each of the five sites. Once surveys are complete, video files will be uploaded onto an external hard drive (+ back-ups) and later analysed for fish abundance and length data in SeaGIS EventMeasure software. These methods are the basis of the departments monitoring program for rocky and coral reefs and have been widely used throughout Australia (Harvey and Shortis 1996, Holmes et al. 2013).</p>
<p>(iv) Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) &ndash; Paired, transportable BRUV units will be used to capture underwater video footage of finfish communities at five fixed sites (mounted with GoPro HERO 4).&nbsp; Five replicates of paired BRUV video footage will be obtained at each site for a minimum of 60 minutes.&nbsp; A bait bag filled with x 600 g of pilchards will be attached within the field of view using a tube of PVC extended from the BRUV frame. Upon retrieving the cameras, each video file will be uploaded onto an external hard drive (+ back-ups) and later analysed for fish abundance. This is an established method used throughout Australia (Willis and Babcock 2000, Harvey et al. 2007, Colton and Swearer 2010).</p>
<p>(v) Unbaited remote underwater video (URUV) &ndash; Paired, transportable URUV units will be used in the same fashion as BRUVs to capture video footage of finfish communities. No bait will be used in the bait bags, but all other aspects of the experimental set-up will be comparable to the BRUV method.</p>
<p>The gut content and stable isotope analyses will improve our understanding of the trophic ecology of seagrass associated fauna assemblages in WA. To do this, stomach contents in fish (from the aforementioned trawls) will be dissected and food items identified to genera level at the MSP laboratory. From the same fish, flesh samples will be collected and analysed in a isotope-ratio mass spectrometry machine to measure carbon and nitrogen isotope content at Edith Cowan University. The subsequent nitrogen and carbon values will help to determine trophic position of consumers and carbon sources at each site. By understanding the diets of multiple co-occurring species and/or trophic groups, through a combination of stable isotopes and stomach contents analysis, we can begin to piece together a food web.&nbsp; This is an important management tool as it provides the ability to predict top-down and bottom-up trophic cascades, highlights keystone species and provides a benchmark for future research and monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Objective 3: </strong></p>
<p>To assess faunal communities across different types of seagrass meadows with varying seascape and within patch metrics, information on finfish assemblages will be collected within Shark Bay Marine Park. Approximately 20 seagrass patches will be assessed, with 3 replicates at each (i.e. trawls or BRUVS). The factors will include landscape metrics (e.g. patch size, distance to reef) and within-patch metrics (e.g. seagrass composition, canopy height and cover) across standardized environmental variables (e.g. depth, salinity), and will be analysed together to inform how finfish communities differ among seagrass meadows. Analyses will consider the influence of these variables on abundance (# fish), diversity (# species), total weight (biomass) and size structure (total length) of fish with different functional roles and fisheries importance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Site selection will be confirmed after the completion of objective 1, which will help outline areas that have the appropriate seagrass genera, patch dynamics, level of fragmentation and distance to adjacent habitats. Sites will be selected to create a gradient in seagrass condition, taxonomic composition, environmental and seascape variables. The exact methods used to assess the faunal assemblage will be derived from objective 2.</p>
<p>Multivariate data on fish communities will be analysed using analysis of variance to assess spatial differences and DistLM combined with redundancy analysis to determine whether faunal assemblages correspond with particular predictor variables. To determine which variables are important predictors of univariate measures of fish assemblages (fish abundance or diversity), GAM combined with a full subset analyses will be used (Fisher et al. 2018). Analysis will likely be conducted using the R package and PRIMER/ PERMANOVA+ software.</p>",granted,False,,granted,True,granted,"<p>The raw data will be stored on Biosys with a full back-up stored on an external hard drive held by each data custodian. Additionally, a page will be created on the DBCA Data Catalogue that will provide links to the data sets (csv), R scripts, and output figures as appropriate. The metadata reports for each field trip will be uploaded onto Confluence under a newly created project linked to the SPP number.</p>",,"[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""FTE Scientist"",""1.5"",""1.4"",""1.3""],[""FTE Technical"",""0.05"",""0.05"",""0.05""],[""Equipment"",""1000"",""1000"",""1000""],[""Vehicle"",""500"",""500"",""500""],[""Travel"",""2100"",""2580"",""2580""],[""Other"",""4600"",""4800"",""1800""],[""Total"",""8200"",""8880"",""5880""]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, Overtime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"
2867,,"<p>Terrestrial biodiversity conservation is informed by data on species and communities at scales ranging from individual habitat patches and reserves to bioregions and biome's depending on the questions being addressed. Traditional methods of biodiversity survey can be time consuming, limiting the sampling effort and geographic scale of surveys and monitoring projects. There is not enough time and resources to fully document global biodiversity considering the current major threats. Newer technologies and analytical methods are likely to be part of the solution to providing biodiversity data at more comprehensive spatial and temporal scales (e.g. Abrego et al, 2018; Ovaskainen et al. 2018; de Camargo et al, 2019). Some of these technologies are already being used, e.g. cameras, but these generate a large amount of data that, at present, has to be manually interpreted. This project, funded by the European Research Council, aims to develop the use of these newer technologies and employ them at a large scale by developing the 'big data' automated analytical technology. In total, about 5 petabytes of data will be generated.</p>
<p>Lifeplan will use audio recorders, camera traps, spore and pollen sampling, soil fungal sampling and insect trapping to measure multiple biotic elements at 200 sites, including 100 'global sites spread across all continents and then more intensive sampling (including a nested sampling project) in Scandinavia and Madagascar. Machine learning/artificial intelligence will be used with the audio recordings and camera trap images (using locally provided training datasets), while the insect, spore/pollen and soil samples will be analysed using genetic methods.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this project is that each of the 100 global sites will consist of a pair of sites, one 'natural' and one 'urban' to investigate the responses of biodiversity to urbanisation. The Perth site is one of two in Australia and will be conducted at Lowlands Nature Reserve (the natural site) and at Kings Park (the urban site).</p>","<p>To survey and contrast the biodiversity values of a large semi-rural nature reserve and a large urban bushland with similar dominant overstorey vegetation (Banksia woodland). This will contribute to an understanding how much biodiversity has been retained in the urban setting as a result of historical and current management, acknowledging that the 'natural' area is not undisturbed.</p>
<p>To improve understanding of the broader biodiversity values of a Threatened Ecological Community (<em>Banksia</em> woodlands of the Swan Coastal Plain).</p>
<p>To contribute to a project that aims to characterise global patterns in biodiversity distribution, contrast urban and natural areas and to upscale emerging technologies for biodiversity survey.</p>
<p>To gain an insight into the application and effectiveness of efficient biodiversity survey methods.</p>",<p>The primary outcome will be an assessment of the utility of newer biodiversity survey methods and the 'big data' analysis tools that will be refined and developed for this project. For the Perth site we will have a comprehensive dataset to better assess the values of a threatened ecological community an urban and more natural setting and understand the values to two important reserves on the Swan Coastal Plain.</p>,"<p>Research papers on each of the methods investigated will be written by the Lifeplan teams in Europe and Canada, with input and co-authorship from the global site managers. We will also write local scientific articles and other forms of communication, including a science information sheet, based on the Perth data.</p>","<p>&nbsp;</p>

1482,,"<p>Although little is known about population size, distribution and residency patterns, it is well accepted that Australian snubfin (<em>Orcaella</em> <em>heinsohni</em>) and Australian humpback dolphin (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) inhabit Australia&rsquo;s tropical north-western coastal waters (Allen<em>, et al.</em> 2012). Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins occur across Australia&rsquo;s entire northwest coast including resident populations at Ningaloo Marine Park and most likely the Dampier Archipelago as well as further north into the Kimberley.&nbsp; The snubfin dolphin is endemic to northern Australia with identified resident populations in the Kimberley, Northern Territory and Queensland (Brown<em>, et al.</em> 2014; Brown<em>, et al.</em> 2014). While this species has been sighted occasionally in the Pilbara, their presence and use of this area is yet to be determined, however the Pilbara is likely to represent the southern extreme of their range (Allen<em>, et al.</em> 2012).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Limited surveys have been conducted targeting coastal dolphins in the Pilbara; exceptions include a dedicated study of humpback dolphins in Ningaloo Marine Park and Exmouth Gulf (Brown<em>, et al.</em> 2012) and opportunistic surveys and anecdotal sightings throughout the region (Allen<em>, et al.</em> 2012). Aerial surveys that were targeting humpback whales sighted dolphins but were unable to differentiate between species due to the high altitude flown (1000 ft) (Jenner &amp; Jenner 2004; Jenner &amp; Jenner 2010). Although the presence of several coastal dolphin species is expected in nearshore waters (humpback, snubfin and bottlenose dolphins) (Hanf 2014) the residency, degree of use and habitat characteristics of these species are unknown in the Pilbara.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human pressures and impacts on these species are increasing, in particular in the Pilbara through activities associated with the rapid expansion of resources sector, including oil and gas exploration and production, coastal infrastructure development and shipping. This is often a key factor that proponents are required to address to secure environmental approvals at the State and Commonwealth levels. However, as noted above, the knowledge base on these species across their range is very poor. In addition, there are no agreed best practice protocols or standards for survey design and data collection on these species that allow for comparison to be made between studies and study sites. &nbsp;A better understanding of these species and their use of tPilbara coastal waters is needed to provide good temporal and regional context for assessing and managing impacts and to reduce uncertainty in the approvals process. As such, the draft<em> Strategic Research Priorities for Marine Mammal Conservation and Management in Western Australia 2014</em> recognised both snubfin and humpback dolphins as high priority species for fundamental research.</p>","<p>This research is being conducted to develop a baseline understanding of key aspects of the ecology of dolphins in coastal Pilbara waters. The specific aims are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine habitat use, distribution, abundance, residency, and movement patterns of dolphins in coastal Pilbara waters;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify the characteristics of habitats used by coastal dolphins, such as water depth, benthic substrate, timing and seasonal variation; and</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine the trophic niche of dolphins in the Pilbara by identifying &nbsp;the prey species they consume.</li>
</ul>","<p>This research will enable a better understanding of coastal dolphin species at a regional and national scale including distribution, abundance, habitat use, movement and connectivity. The main outcomes and benefits will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distribution and abundance including high density areas and spatial and temporal patterns of coastal dolphins will be identified and mapped across the Pilbara to allow managers to assess conflicts with potential pressures;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key habitat will be identified which can be used to assess potential overlap with pressures such as habitat loss from coastal development and displacement from industrial development leading to better informed decision making during Environmental Impact Assessment processes;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Populations will be defined for coastal dolphin species (humpback, bottlenose and snubfin, where applicable) which will allow managers to assess the relative conservation significance of different populations or species in relation to pressures or factors like restricted distributions;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baseline data will inform ongoing regional monitoring and management and for comparison with other regions;</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A state-wide database will be implemented modelled on the Northern Territory database &lsquo;DolFIN&rsquo; to archive and manage survey and photo-Identification data which will improve information management, compatibility and information sharing between jurisdictions</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data on population abundance and distribution of humpback and snubfin dolphins in the Pilbara will allow a more comprehensive assessment of their conservation status at a State and National level.</li>
</ul>","<p>At a state level the Department of Parks and Wildlife and the Office of Environmental Protection Authority (OEPA) will be the main user of this knowledge. &nbsp;The Environmental Management Branch within Parks and Wildlife and the OEPA currently have limited information on which to assess Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) on these dolphin species in the Pilbara. This information will be used in EIA processes to evaluate and mitigate potential impacts on coastal dolphins by informing the appropriateness of proposed developments in relation to critical habitat identified through this project. The presence of coastal dolphin species and the vulnerability of these populations to coastal development will be more apparent from this study.&nbsp; Industry (Port Authorities, Oil and Gas companies) will be interested in methodology, e.g. protocols and standard operating procedures for dolphin surveys and the resulting baseline data to inform future proposals and EIA related documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the findings and information &nbsp;will be used by Parks and Wildlife Marine Science Program to manage marine mammals in the Pilbara and across the state using this baseline information and protocols to establish long term monitoring. Data will be relevant to marine conservation planning through marine protected area planning and through conservation status assessment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When announcing the 2011 Finalised Priority Assessment List of Threatened Species under the EPBC Act, the Federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke said he had received advice that there was currently not enough information to properly assess the snubfin dolphin however he was &ldquo;hopeful that we will be able to collect enough information to do a proper assessment before long&rdquo;. This project will gather information on the population status of the snubfin dolphin in the Pilbara region, WA and this information can be used towards the overall assessment of the conservation status of this species.</p>","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p><strong>Field sampling</strong></p>
<p>A combination of distance sampling techniques (through aerial and boat surveys) and mark-recapture (through boat surveys) will be used to investigate dolphin density, distribution and abundance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Boat surveys</em></p>
<p>Sampling will take place three times a year for a two week period, subject to weather (March, June/July, October in 2014-2016). Surveys will be conducted along pre-determined line transects from a small 5m centre console RIB (or equivalent) research vessel driven at a speed of 8 to 12 kn with two observers and one boat driver present during each survey. Line transects will be designed to run perpendicular to the mainland coastline where possible to account for the water depth gradient and distance from coast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Transect design</em></p>
<p>The study area will be divided into multiple zones for the purpose of the boat based surveys. The initial four zones have been selected based on known densities of dolphins and/or suspected presence based on habitat. Other potential zones include Exmouth Gulf and Cape Preston.</p>
<p>Zone 1- transects will extend offshore a maximum of 3nm from the mainland coastline and extend alongshore 20 kilometres north and south of Onslow township.</p>
<p>Zone 2- transects will be centred around Thevenard Island and radiate from the island to 2 nautical miles and between Thevenard Island and the mainland (~12km).</p>
<p>Zone 3- transects will centre around Dampier Port and the Dampier archipelago within state waters (3nm)</p>
<p>Zone 4- transects will centre around Balla Balla and extend alongshore extending offshore to state waters (3nm)</p>
<p>A sampling design of transects will be prepared for each zone that will allow for that zone to be surveyed by boat within a single day (weather permitting) to avoid re-sighting dolphins as they move through the study area.The overall survey route will be divided into smaller transects of at least 10 kilometres in length. The 10 kilometre transects will be completed in a random order and repeated at least 6 times over two years.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Sighting data</em></p>
<p>When a dolphin is sighted the following data will be recorded; species, distance and angle between the vessel and the dolphin, and dolphin group size. The position of the vessel on the transect will also be recorded before the vessel departs the transect line. Once this initial information is recorded, the vessel will approach the dolphin group to within 50 m to capture additional data such as photo-identification of individual dolphins, age and group composition and predominant behaviour (feeding, foraging, travelling, resting or socialising). &nbsp;When foraging or feeding is recorded as the predominant behaviour, the species of prey wil be recorded whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The duration of sightings of dolphin groups will be short where possible (5 minutes minimum to determine predominant behaviour and photograph all individuals) to maximise the search effort along the transect line and ensure completion of each transect during suitable weather (Beaufort scale &lt;3). At the completion of each sighting the transect line will be re-joined where it was departed (marked by the GPS waypoint).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Aerial surveys</em></p>
<p>The study area will be divided into two zones for the purpose of aerial surveys</p>
<p>Zone 1 &ndash; will be the area surveyed and demarked in the dugong research plan extending south of Onslow and offshore to Barrow Island.</p>
<p>Zone 2- will be the area north of the area already surveyed north of Onslow, Barrow Island and encompassing the Dampier Archipelago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aerial surveys will be conducted by a fixed high-wing aircraft flying a pre-determined survey route of line transects. The aircraft will follow transect lines at a low altitude (500 ft) and a speed of 80km/hr. There will be two dedicated observers; one on each side of the aircraft and a survey leader collating the data. The two observers and the survey leader will communicate via aviation headsets and the survey leader will record the data being called by the observers. For each dolphin group sighted the species, number of individuals visible, position in the transect and number of calves will be recorded. For the purpose of species identification and confirming group size, the group will be circled, counted and then the transect line resumed.</p>
<p><em>Tissue Sample Collection &ndash; connectivity and trophic niche assessment</em></p>
<p>Tissue samples will be collected using remote biopsy techniques; either a modified air rifle with darts (Kr&uuml;tzen<em>, et al.</em> 2002) or a pole puncture system for bow-riding individuals (Bilgmann<em>, et al.</em> 2006). These samples will be collected during vessel based surveys, though these surveys will be conducted separate to the line transect surveys described above. Approximately 20 samples per sample site across the Pilbara region will be the target sample size (maximum total samples approximately 100). Approximately 20 samples already exist from the North West Cape and Dampier Archipelago for humpback dolphins Tissue samples will be sub-sampled for the purpose of stable isotope and genetic analysis and stored appropriately following Western Australian Museum protocols. External researchers will be engaged to collect samples and the laboratory analysis will be outsourced for this aspect of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Photo identification - processing and archiving</em></p>
<p>Photo identification images will be collected in the field. A protocol will be followed of collecting at least one image for both sides of the dorsal fin for each individual dolphin regardless of degree of marking or familiarity. The images will then be graded using standard protocols. The images will be graded in relation to: 1) quality (angle, focus and the ratio of fin to frame) and 2) distinctiveness (how marked the individual is from not marked to severely marked). Survey data will be entered and managed in a relational database (DolFIN) with survey images matched to the photo-identification catalogue and linked to the relevant survey information. This database will be used to generate the capture histories and distribution data that will then be analysed statistically using software such as MARK, DISTANCE and Arc GIS.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Distribution and abundance estimation</em></p>
<p>Mark-recapture methods will be applied to the photo-identification data that will be stored and processed in the DolFIN database. Capture histories will be generated for individual dolphins and abundance will be modeled using either POPAN or the Robust Design in program MARK 23/07/2014(Nicholson<em>, et al.</em> 2012; Smith<em>, et al.</em> 2013; Tyne<em>, et al.</em> 2014). Parameters such as apparent survival and temporary emigration will be estimated. Abundance and distribution may also be calculated using the program DISTANCE for comparative purposes if time permits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Habitat modelling</em></p>
<p>Dolphin sightings from two platforms (aerial and boat) will be analysed in ArcGIS and incorporated into a broadscale habitat model per species with variables such as distance from coast, benthic habitat, SST, water depth, slope and behaviour to investigate which environmental variables best explain dolphin distribution across the Pilbara study area. This analysis will build on preliminary analysis by Hanf 2014 (Murdoch University masters project) that modelled dolphin sighting data collected during 2012 dugong aerial surveys for Chevron using MAXENT modelling (presence-only) software. A pilot project of incorporating Department of Parks and Wildlife benthic habitat data will be incorporated into this model in October 2014 to see if benthic habitat type is an important predictor in dolphin distribution. Boat sighting data will be incorporated into the habitat model to improve the species representation (this may be biased due to dugongs being the focal species of the aerial surveys) and to validate the habitat model. Potentially other habitat models may be used including Generalised Linear Models if the presence-only models in MAXENT are deemed to be of limited value in identifying habitat characteristics important to these dolphin species in this area and if the model has limited overall predictive ability of dolphin distribution across the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Connectivity</em></p>
<p>Genetic analyses will follow methodology by Brown <em>et al.</em> 2014 and will likely include mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci with PCR conditions as described in Bacher <em>et al.</em> 2010 and Fr&egrave;re <em>et al.</em> 2010. Several measures of population differentiation will likely be calculated from several sample sites across the Pilbara region. Statistical software such as STRUCTURE, FLOCK and BOTTLENECK may be used for to examine the differentiation patterns between populations and to test whether there has been a recent bottleneck (Brown<em>, et al.</em> 2014). This component of the project will likely be contracted to Murdoch University Cetacean Research Unit.</p>

1512,,"<p>The Dampier Archipelago is situated adjacent to Dampier (pop. 1,341) and Karratha (pop. 25,907), 1,650 km north of Perth in the Pilbara Nearshore Marine Bioregion (Figure 1). The marine and coastal environment of the Dampier Archipelago/Cape Preston Region has a unique combination of 42 offshore islands, intertidal and subtidal reefs, mangroves, macroalgal communities and coral reefs. The area is the second most diverse region for hard corals in Western Australia, with coral reef habitats comprising 8% (approx. 18,300 ha) of the major marine habitats, consisting of 229 scleractinian coral species from 57 genera (Griffith 1998). In surveys carried out in 1998-2002 the Western Australian Museum recorded 736 fish species (Hutchins 2001), over 1,227 species of mollusc, including five regional endemics (Slack-Smith and Bryce 2004), 438 species of crustacean (Hewitt 2004), 275 sponge species (Fromont 1998), and 286 echinoderm species (Marsh and Morrison 2004).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is there high species diversity in the area but many of the islands and beaches provide habitats and feeding areas for threatened marine fauna. A number of beaches in the area are important nesting sites for five species of marine turtle. There are at least 16 species of sea birds known to form large nesting colonies in the region. Over 50% of the mainland shore is lined with complex mangrove habitats, comprising six species, and are considered to be of international significance (Semeniuk and Wurm 1987). The area also contains important feeding and travelling grounds for marine mammals. The annual humpback whale migration passes through the Dampier Archipelago, and eight toothed whale species and four baleen whales have been documented utilising the area. Dugongs are also regularly sighted using the extensive seagrass beds within the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dampier Archipelago is rich in cultural and historical value, with the indigenous history of the Yaburara people extending back 20,000 years. The area is referred to as Murujuga land and contains some of Australia&rsquo;s earliest art and cultural sites (CALM 2005).&nbsp; Other culturally significant areas include; quarries, middens, fish traps, rock shelters, ceremonial places, artefact scatters, grinding patches and stone arrangements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the Dampier Archipelago/Cape Preston area, species and habitat depletion have been recorded (CALM 2005), with the area subject to increasing human pressures. The nearby town of Karratha has the highest per capita boat ownership in Australia (CALM 2005)and recreational fishing pressure in the archipelago waters is likely to be high. There are also commercial prawn, demersal finfish, and interim mackerel fisheries, with the area also important to Western Australia&rsquo;s aquarium fishery. There are also multiple pearl aquaculture sites, a productive saltworks (opened in 1972) and Dampier Port development, pipeline and processing facilities and shipping associated with industrial development.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dampier Archipelago/Cape Preston area was identified for consideration as a marine conservation reserve by the <em>Marine Parks and Reserves Selection Working Group</em> (MPRSWG 1994), which identified representative and unique areas of Western Australia&rsquo;s marine waters for consideration as part of a statewide system of marine parks. Waters surrounding the Dampier Archipelago were reported as having significant conservation values, and the report highlighted the overlap of ecological values and high levels of human activity in the area. An Indicative Management Plan (IMP; CALM 2005) has been written to provide a framework for how the marine ecological and social values of the area can be protected. The IMP proposes creation of three separate marine protected areas; Dampier Marine Park East, Dampier Marine Park West and the Regnard Marine Management Area (Figure 1). In total the proposed protected areas cover 214,920 ha of State waters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Woodside&rsquo;s Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) project is an approved operation utilising the Dampier area for processes around the extraction of gas, transport via a gas pipeline to an onshore processing facility, storage and then export via a shipping port, loading jetty and channel. Alongside the LNG processing and export facility, a large scale dredging program, removing 14 million cubic meters of sediment, has been occurring since 2003. The EPA approved the development on the condition that Woodside implement a substantive offset package. The Pluto LNG Offset &lsquo;D&rsquo; Program was initiated as a result of Ministerial Approval Statement 757 and included a funding agreement between Woodside Burrup Pty Ltd in its capacity as operator of the Pluto LNG development and the state of Western Australia. The agreement defines the focus of the Pluto LNG Offset &lsquo;D&rsquo; as &lsquo;<em>Research and monitoring consistent with the Indicative Management Plan for the Dampier Archipelago Marine Park&rsquo;</em>.</p>","<p>There are four main projects within the Pluto LNG Offset &lsquo;D&rsquo; Program. They are to:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-roman;"">
<li><em>Review, assess and summarise historical data relevant to the management of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;</em></li>
<li><em>Determine distribution, patterns and key processes of major marine communities and large marine fauna of the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area;</em></li>
<li><em>Describe patterns and trends in human use in the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area; </em>and</li>
<li><em>Establish long-term monitoring reference sites in the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The focus of this SPP is on the project &lsquo;iv&rsquo; which required the implementation of monitoring within the Proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area. Monitoring will be consistent with the State Government&rsquo;s Indicative Management Plan for the area. The aim of project &lsquo;iv&rsquo; is to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Develop and implement a monitoring, evaluation and reporting (MER) program of key biodiversity asset condition and their major pressures at key sites in the proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will implement an integrated, effective and efficient monitoring, evaluation and reporting process that allows measurement and evaluation of condition and pressure changes in a way that is robust but practical and cost effective. The objectives of this project are:</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: circle;"">
<li>Complete a prioritisation of ecological assets listed in the indicative management plan to identify high priority assets for monitoring;</li>
<li>Establish reference sites for monitoring high priority assets in the Proposed Dampier Archipelago Marine Park and Regnard Marine Management Area, taking into account, spatial and temporal distribution of key pressures acting on assets, previous data availability, the standards of the Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program and stakeholder recommendations;</li>
<li>Provide quantitative evidence on the status and trends in selected indicators of asset condition and the pressure/s on these assets, to assist managers to make better-informed decisions within an active adaptive management framework;</li>
<li>Contribute to the development of best practice monitoring techniques for assets and pressures where knowledge is lacking;</li>
<li>Contribute data, as appropriate, to assist development of Parks and Wildlife&rsquo;s strategic marine planning and conservation initiatives;</li>
<li>Assist other government departments and industry environmental management programs; and</li>
<li>To establish links with indigenous owners and encourage their involvement in monitoring and marine conservation.</li>
</ul>","<ul>
<li><em>A better understanding of the value, spatial extent and status of the shallow tropical communities of the Dampier archipelago.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>An established monitoring program will facilitate evidence-based long-term adaptive management for the proposed reserves, and promote environmental understanding for a range of stakeholders and the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<em>Data on ecological assets will inform a baseline of natural and human induced change when the marine reserves are gazetted.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This project will produce baseline data on various key ecological assets and the pressures acting on them. This will inform Parks and Wildlife managers, the vesting authority, stakeholders and the broader community of the condition of the marine reserves over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Parks and Wildlife and the scientific community will benefit from having newly developed, tested and documented indicators and methods for monitoring Pilbara marine environments.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This project will develop new marine monitoring indicators and methods for key ecological assets and habitats that are largely novel to northern WA. Development of these monitoring indicators and methods may also assist marine monitoring implementation and reserve management in the Kimberley region.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Assistance for other government departments and Industry through better understanding of the importance of, and change in, the natural assets of the Dampier Region.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The data collected by this project will be accessible in the event of an environmental incident, so that industry has baseline evidence of the condition of marine communities. Providing information to major industrial users of the area will create awareness of the condition and pressure on assets and values in the proposed marine reserve and it will also highlight the role of Parks and Wildlife in conservation management.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<em>Foster operational collaborations with traditional owners.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Parks and Wildlife recognizes joint management with Aboriginal people as a primary objective of conservation management. This project will nurture collaboration and information sharing through consultation with the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, whose ranger group is to be involved in field activities.</p>","<p>The most significant use of this information is for the management of the marine environment, both through the Parks and Wildlife planning department, specialist branches (e.g. science and conservation division) and regional operational staff. The information gained from this project will be used to inform planning for the proposed marine reserves (by Parks and Wildlife and the vesting authority), and assist &nbsp;&nbsp;Parks and Wildlife regional staff to gain an understanding of change in ecological assets in relation to marine park management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information collected in this project will also be provided to other government management agencies. This work may advise the Office of the Environmental Protect Authority during the Environmental Impact Assessment and support research and monitoring carried out by Department of Fisheries and CSIRO. When the park is established, historical data, as well as data collected through this program, will be ready to feed directly into the MPRA (Marine Parks and Reserves Authority) reporting process carried out by Marine Science Program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A copy of all major reports will be forwarded to Woodside and baseline/monitoring data will be made available to the oil spill response team in the event of an incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the aims of this work is to involve the indigenous community and keep them updated on the condition of the system. Researchers on this project will also seek advice from traditional owners throughout the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this work we will communicate information on the current status of WA marine assets to the community. Communication outputs will include more &lsquo;general reading&rsquo; publications, e.g. Parks and Wildlife Landscope.</p>","<p>The specific outputs of this project are:</p>

<p>The Indicative Management Plan describes 14 ecological assets detailed in the Indicative Management Plan, which are: geomorphology, sediment and water quality, coral reef communities, mangrove communities, macroalgae and seagrass communities, subtidal soft-bottom communities, intertidal sand and mudflat communities, rocky shore communities, turtles, marine mammals, seabirds, finfishes, and invertebrates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prioritisation</strong></p>
<p>All assets need to be considered for monitoring, however, managers must prioritise assets to ensure the effective use of limited resources (Simpson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Following the framework outlined in Simpson <em>et al</em> (2015) a preliminary monitoring prioritisation was completed prior to planning this project and proceeding with field surveys. This involved requesting the assistance of a panel of experts, with experience in the Dampier region, to score the value of each asset and the pressure they perceive this asset to be under. Assets that were considered of high value and under high pressure will be the initial focus of monitoring. Twelve experts from government, industry and academia, with good knowledge of the marine environment in the Dampier Archipelago, were surveyed and the resultant order of asset priority is presented in Table 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table 1 Results of monitoring prioritisation carried out by 12 experts with knowledge of the Dampier region. The mean values are presented with both upper and lower Confidence Intervals. The asset with the highest mean rank, and all other assets with 95% confidence intervals that overlap with highest asset, were highlighted in bold as high priority for monitoring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the priortisation of assets, coral communities were identified as having the highest mean rank, though fish communities, mangroves and turtles were also considered high priority and will be the focus of monitoring efforts. Macroalgae and seagrass, as well as invertebrates also ranked highly, but as a lower priority for monitoring. Monitoring of other assets may be undertaken opportunistically or by other researchers and we will endeavor to support their programs where appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Site selection process</strong></p>
<p>Sites are to be selected based on a combination of factors; the availability of historical data, site descriptions, and vicinity to anthropogenic pressures. Sites will be selected to maximize potential of recording change as a result of anthropogenic pressures, while minimizing the potential range of confounding factors (including natural pressures). Detailed site descriptions by the Western Australian Museum (Jones 2004) will assist with site selection. Also, pressure variables found within datasets, such as water quality and industrial development projects will be used to advise site selection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A scoping fieldtrip is to be carried out to visit an extended number of potential sites for monitoring high priority assets. These will be identified using the above criteria and assessed for suitability. Wherever possible, sites will be selected where multiple assets are well represented. For example, at reef sites attempts will be made to monitor coral, finfish and invertebrate communities concurrently. By monitoring multiple assets at the same site, results can advise on interactions between communities and highlight secondary pressures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Indicators </strong></p>
<p>WAMMP &lsquo;Asset Knowledge Reviews&rsquo; highlight important asset condition, pressure and management response (CPR) indicators and recommend methods for their measurement. This project will measure the condition of selected assets in the context of possibly interacting natural, anthropogenic and climate change pressures. Monitoring will use standard WAMMP methods, except where new indicators and methods need to be identified.</p>

<p><strong>High Priority Assets &ndash; Sites and Methods</strong></p>
<p>Assets identified as high priority in the prioritisation process will be monitored initially, with main effort focusing on establishing permanent sites, collecting baseline datasets and where appropriate publication of results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Coral communities </em></p>
<p>Digital still imagery along fixed transects will be used to provide data on the live cover, composition, and diversity of coral communities. At each site, three replicate 50 m transects will be permanently marked with star pickets positioned at each end of each transect and marked for relocation using a GPS at the surface. To help ensure the accurate resampling along the transect steel marker rods will be fixed to the substrate every 10m. Benthic community along these transects will be monitored by taking 50 digital images per transect at a height of 1 m from the substrate. This will enable analysis of the structural benthic community metrics in the laboratory using a point count method, while providing a permanent record for potential investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coral settlement is also highlighted as an important functional metric for monitoring coral reef communities (coupled with the examination of shifts in coral size frequency). The use of coral settlement tiles can estimate larval supply to an area and provide a relatively simple estimate of recruitment potential (Babcock <em>et al.</em> 2003). Crude assessments of juvenile coral abundance may also be gathered from digital images (Turner <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coral communities will be monitored every two years at a range of sites over the proposed marine reserves. Fifteen preliminary sites (Figure 2) have been selected for monitoring and attempts will be made to monitor other assets (fish and invertebrates) concurrently at these sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fish</em></p>
<p>Fish communities will be monitored for changes in community abundance, diversity and population structure (major indicators, Table 2) using stereo video methods, which enables the identification of species and measurements of fish size (Harvey <em>et al.</em> 2002).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six independent 50 meter transects will be completed by employing Diver Operated Video (DOV). This provides a permanent record of the fish assemblage and allows analysis of the videos in the laboratory by experienced staff. At each site, video transects will be swum by a two diver team. The first person in the dive team swims the DOV unit, with the second person measuring the transect. The divers leave a 10 meter gap between each transect to maintain independence of replicates. Transects are swum at a rate of three-four minutes per 50m in a relatively straight line (following habitat and depth gradient), in a direction away from the sun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stereo-video equipment comprises two forward facing video units secured to an aluminium frame. A light emitting diode is positioned on a rod in front of the cameras so the footage can be syncronised when it is viewed on a computer. The video units are configured to record the fish from different angles. Analysis of high definition video footage is completed in the laboratory following the fieldtrip, allowing accurate identification of individuals and length measurements. Digital imagery is analysed using the seaGIS software &lsquo;Event Measure&rsquo;, which allows for the calculation the accurate size of the fish by mathematical triangulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fish communities will be monitored at the same 15 sites assessed for the benthic community surveys (Figure 2). This allows fish community data to be associated with benthic structure and composition information. Fish communities will be monitored every two years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Turtles</em></p>
<p>Turtles have dedicated research and monitoring programs through the Marine Science Program. At present there is a large-scale study of the turtle populations in the Pilbara, being undertaken by Parks and Wildlife, Marine Science Program (SPP 002-2013), and this will include an assessment of populations in the Dampier Archipelago. There are presently multiple programs monitoring turtle nesting running throughout the Dampier Archipelago. Parks and Wildlife are working with Rio Tinto to monitor Hawksbill, Green and Loggerhead turtles at Rosemary Island (Spiers <em>et al.</em> 2013). In addition Rio Tinto is also funding a long term turtle monitoring program at Legendre and Delambre Island (Biota Environmental Sciences 2009). Since this asset is well covered in the Dampier region, it would not be cost effective to establish another program, when time and funding could be spent focusing on other less researched assets. Therefore, this project will attempt to assist the current turtle monitoring work where possible through field support and the collection and contribution of pressure related data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Mangroves</em></p>
<p>The extent, condition and cover of mangrove communities are the main indicators (Table 2) of health and these will be assessed using remote sensing techniques. It is a requirement that these images be ground-truthed, and this will allow for assessment of on ground health indicators including tree density and foliage condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rectified and calibrated satellite imagery allows for fast, cost effective monitoring of mangroves over large spatial scales. This will be achieved using ALOS or SPOT 6 imagery, which have a pixel size of ten and five meters, respectively. A time series of three historical records will be analysed initially to develop an appropriate baseline time series index of vegetation trends. Images will then be purchased every two years of the monitoring program, to reduce cost outlay, and also align with the bi-annual schedule used for monitoring other assets. Imagery will be collected in November, when they become available. The major aim of this monitoring is to identify communities that are stable, in decline or increasing over the time period of years captured by quantifying change in mangrove extent and foliage cover (as a proxy for condition).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ground truthing will be undertaken at predetermined points among the survey sites. The purpose of ground truthing is to verify data calculated from remote techniques, it is therefore not necessary to have ongoing <em>in situ</em> work for the monitoring program. However, there are cases where re-survey may be necessary, such as after a major event or where difficulty exists interpreting the results of the remote study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ground truthing sites will be chosen according to satellite image characteristics. Two types of &lsquo;set point photograph&rsquo; will be taken at each point; the first will be a wide angle overview of the community as a whole; the second will be a series of close up photographs taken along the fringes of the communities, or in areas of disturbance (as these are the areas that are the most accessible and where change is most likely to occur). In the second series of photos individual trees will be identified and photographed from a distance of 8 meters. A surveyor&rsquo;s staff will be included in all photos taken to determine tree height and foliage width. Four upward facing photos will be taken, capturing the canopy cover and 4-6 photos of the substrate under/around the tree will be collected.Field notes will be collected along with the photographs and these will include basic measurements, including; tree height and trunk width, tree mortality and damage, and pneumatophore density. A photo of the tripod position relative to the tree will also be taken for future reference. Additional GPS marks will be collected for the tree trunk and tripod position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A total of 10 areas have been selected for mangrove monitoring (Figure 3) based on the availability of GIS imagery encompassing existing mangrove forests. The sites are distributed inside and outside of the proposed marine reserves and at varying proximity to development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Priority Assets &ndash; Methodological Development</strong></p>
<p>In order to increase the capacity of the Marine Science Program, attempts will be made to develop some asset monitoring programs that are not currently established. This work will be second priority to the assets identified above, and these projects will only be attempted if time and capacity allow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Macroalgae and Seagrass</em></p>
<p>Indicators and methods for monitoring tropical seagrass and macroalgae in northern WA are yet to be identified. With the assistance of the WAMMP Asset Leader for seagrass and algae, this project will collaborate with internal and external groups to identify appropriate monitoring techniques. In order to develop techniques, there will be an initial collection of research work, drafting a literature review and trial of appropriate methodologies in the field. A cost-benefit analysis will then be undertaken to determine a method which is achievable and returns appropriate data. Once a Standard Operating Procedure is in place, appropriate sites will be selected using remote imagery, ground truthed, and monitoring will commence in the Dampier region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primary productivity, and natural variability, of benthic primary producers has been identified as potential area of focus for research in the Dampier Archipelago, and has been highlighted as a research priority in Pluto Offset &lsquo;D&rsquo; project &lsquo;ii&rsquo;. The work undertaken in this project, will compliment and extend the findings of that research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Invertebrates</em></p>
<p>The main indicator for change in invertebrate communities is abundance (Table 2), particularly those targeted through human activities (e.g. collection of crustaceans, large clams, topshells, urchins and sea cucumbers), but also species which may pose a threat to other communities, e.g. pressure on the condition of corals from crown-of thorns starfish (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) and the corallivorous gastropod <em>Drupella</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methods have been established to monitor invertebrates on coral reefs; however, if time allows, part of this project will include research into the development of monitoring techniques for an array of target invertebrates harvested from other habitats, such as mangroves and seagrass. As part of this work, research will be undertaken to identify priority species targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries and aquarium collectors in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Invertebrate monitoring will be undertaken at multiple sites throughout the Dampier, and attempts will be made to monitor within a subset of different benthic communities including coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass and macroalgae. In some cases, and where appropriate, invertebrate monitoring may be carried out at complementary benthic monitoring sites. This co-location of assessment sites will allow for comparison between benthic structure and composition, to assess how invertebrate abundance can influence other communities, and how changes in habitat structure can influence invertebrate communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pressure Metrics</strong></p>
<p>The Department&rsquo;s marine monitoring program operates within a condition, pressure and management response (CPR) framework to enable and facilitate the assessment of management effectiveness. Monitoring enables a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic pressures on marine assets, and through subsequent targeted but adaptive management allows for mitigation of their impacts. Understanding pressures is vital to being able to respond to changes in the condition of assets and determining management and level of protection required. As part of this project, it is necessary to understand and monitor the major pressures on the assets that are sought to be conserved and managed in the proposed reserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pressures to be monitored are listed in Table 2. Some of these are already addressed through monitoring of other or assets e.g. habitat loss which is a pressure on fish and invertebrate communities is measured through monitoring changes in cover of benthic communities. For other pressure metrics, data will be collected independently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Variation in the physical condition of coastal waters can drive change in marine communities. Temperature is one of the most significant pressure parameters for ecological assets. At five coral monitoring sites, two temperature loggers will be deployed for the extent of the project, and replaced at alternating six month periods (one swapped in May, the other in Nov). Each logger will collect an hourly reading every day for 12 months. Results from these will be assessed to determine how many are replaced after the first year, and these in-situ recordings will be compared to remotely collected sea surface temperature data collected and modeled by NOAA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Data Analyses</strong></p>
<p>Broad spatial and temporal patterns in asset condition will be investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses.&nbsp; Relationships between the structure of the biological communities and physical variables and human use will be assessed where possible. The relationship between condition and pressure can be analysed using a suite of metrics including regression and correlation techniques. The proposed marine reserve is extensive and encompasses diverse habitats, a range of pressures and varied conditions. Spatial variability must be considered when analysing data from this project. Given the short time frame of this project, it is unlikely that meaningful long-term comparisons will be possible. In many cases sites have been selected where historic sites existed, and attempts will be made to compare the findings from this program to historic data. However, in many cases the metrics measured or the techniques used may not be comparable, and other parameters may limit interpretation of relationships with historic data. &nbsp;The data will be regularly tested for power and considered for trend analysis when the strength of the data allows for confidence in the results.&nbsp;</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,not required,"<p>All raw data will be presented in a data report and archived on DPaW&rsquo;s Marine Science Program server and on an archived hard drive.</p>

1258,,"Disturbance is part of evolutionary history for many organisms, particularly marine organisms. The amount of connectivity between marine populations has important implications for metapopulation resilience to natural and human disturbances^1,2^. High connectivity within marine metapopulations suggests resilience to localised impacts through the immigration of new recruits from nearby or distant populations.

However, an increased frequency of disturbance cycles may disrupt the typical connectivity regimes, resulting in altered benthic and associated faunal community composition^3-10^. Extreme warming events in recent years with sea surface temperatures up to 5 °C above long-term averages on the west coast of

Australia have shown that benthos and associated fauna are susceptible to thermal damage from abnormally warm sea water^11-13^. These effects may be further exacerbated by cyclonic activity^11,14^ and human impacts, including pollution, fishing, coastal development and associated sedimentation through dredging^15^. While the scale of natural disturbance due to climate change is still debated, one can confidently say that anthropogenic pressures due to extraction of natural resources have increased significantly over the past decade in the relatively untouched marine environment in north-western Australia. Environmental managers require information on metapopulation resilience through connectivity in order to design and implement appropriate management regimes to maintain ecological processes in the face of increasing human pressure coupled with forecast increase in natural disturbance.

Demersal marine species, organisms living on or near the seafloor, are particularly at risk from localised human or natural disturbance as they are unable to flee the pressure exerted upon them. Dispersal by most

demersal species is typically achieved through a pelagic larval stage of varying duration, which has the potential to link nearby and distant populations^16^. An understanding of this larval dispersal process was elusive until recent advances in trace-elemental fingerprinting (investigating the presence of geographical differentiation of natural isotopes or manually added isotopes in ear bones of fish or gastropod shells)^17-19^ and genetic studies using hypervariable markers^16^. These techniques have shown that 1) self-recruitment to the natal reef is common, 2) typical dispersal is within the range of tens of km, and 3) minimal dispersal events over 100's of km maintain the observed genetic homogeneity between distant marine metapopulations. These findings are supported by contemporary 3-dimensional oceanographic modelling where dispersal kernels estimate similar modal ranges with episodic long tails^20,21^. The majority of broadscale genetic studies, using a range of neutral markers, also reflect the open nature of the marine environment where low levels of genetic structure are attributed to few migration barriers^22^. However, significant genetic variation has still been found in populations ranging from oceanic scale^23^ to tens of km^24^. Environmental heterogeneity also exerts selection pressure that varies in space and time and provides opportunity for local adaptation between populations^25,26^.

Population genomics is the study of genome-wide variation at the population level, which is not a new concept, but has only recently become a widely-accessible and cost-effective tool for studying evolutionary processes relevant to conservation and ecological genetics. More traditional molecular markers used in population genetics, such as microsatellites, provide valuable data but only capture putatively neutral variation from a very small proportion of the genome^27,28^. An alternative, genome-wide marker involves single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their greatest advantage over more traditional markers is twofold; 1) SNPs are highly abundant across the genome providing much greater resolution of evolutionary processes affecting population demography and phylogenetic history and 2) SNPs are not restricted to neutral regions, such that they can be used to detect effects of selection indicative of adaptive variation, which is of crucial importance in the face of changing climates and increased anthropogenic impacts to natural populations^27^. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have facilitated the rapid discovery and genotyping of thousands of SNPs scattered throughout the entire genome in a cost-effective manner^28-30^. Most importantly, these techniques can be applied without preliminary knowledge of the genome under study and are widely applicable across taxa^28,31^.

The marine environment in the Pilbara region has received several extreme heating events and several cyclones in the past few years thus decreasing benthic organisms such as coral (up to 84%)^11^. The shallow shelf reefs of the Onslow region had massive reduction from 50-5% coral cover (Chevron unpublished data). Recently, Gilmour et al^54^ showed that remote atolls with deep refuges recovered within 12 years of a major coral bleaching event at Scott Reef. With few deep water refuges in the Onslow region, recovery potential of these reefs is dependent on the few remaining corals and dispersal from reefs to the west at Ningaloo and Muiron Islands and to the North at Barrow and the Montebello Islands. In addition to major coral loss due to heating, the Onslow region is currently under the influence of a four year dredging operation (Chevron Wheatstone project) which may impact on some of these coral reefs. Future natural and anthropogenic disturbance in this region may also undermine the recovery potential of these coral reefs. As such a study is required to a) determine the levels of genetic connectivity between locations in the Pilbara and investigate any genetic adaptation within the region to understand the ecological relevance of the connectivity, and b) understand the impact of recent natural stresses and conduct a demographic study of the recovery potential of reefs at a smaller scale within the Onslow region using in-situ coral settlement tiles to measure larval supply, in-situ recruit survival and growth, and growth and mortality of adults.

Knowledge of the diversity, distribution, population and community trends of animals and plants is vital to making informed biodiversity conservation decisions. DBCA undertakes considerable ecological and environmental monitoring in support of conservation initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">Traditional monitoring methods or assemblages have developed over many decades and have produced results that have significantly improved conservation management. However, methods for ecological monitoring is continually evolving, and in recent years techniques such as camera traps, audio recorders and satellite tracking have resulted in improved effectiveness of monitoring programs. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is another emerging technology that is starting to be operationalised as part of the monitoring toolkit. No one technology can provide all of the tools needed for ecological monitoring, but eDNA has some advantages over other methods in some situations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">Some existing methods are not ideal for detecting elusive or poorly known taxa<sup>1,2,5</sup> and can be laborious in time and effort. Significant taxonomic expertise is often required to identify or at least distinguish taxa, especially invertebrates, but such expertise is decreasingly available<sup>6-8</sup>. The similarity of some closely related species at the juvenile life stage and the presence of cryptic species can also hinder identification. Increasingly, genetic methods of biodiversity survey and monitoring, such as metabarcoding and specifically environmental DNA (eDNA), are being proposed as alternative methods to overcome some of these problems<sup>2,9</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">eDNA refers to the genetic material found in environmental samples, released from living or dead organisms, including extracellular DNA, whole cells and even whole organisms<sup>2,10</sup>. The DNA can originate from individuals that are occupying a location or deposited as they pass through. For example, if we sample a water body, DNA may have originated from animals that lived in the water or that visited the water body to drink. Studies increasingly advocate that eDNA studies are all that is needed, but, as with other monitoring tools, eDNA has limitations that need to be considered. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">The amount of eDNA released into the environment is highly variable and is influenced by factors such as the species, life stage and biomass at the location sampled. Some environments, such as water, allows the eDNA to diffuse from its point of origin so that finding the exact location of the target species can be difficult. Many environmental variables can degrade DNA, including temperature, pH, UV, salinity, and microbial activity<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span><sup>11,12</sup>. Therefore, the length of time that eDNA is available after shedding depends on its environment. While eDNA can detect rare and cryptic species, it cannot determine population biology information, such as sex ratios and body condition.</span></p>

</ol>","<p>Unlike traditional survey methods, eDNA does not involve capturing or visualising a live organism but rather DNA of an uncertain origin. Before sampling begins for an eDNA project, there are several essential considerations regarding sample design. Observing a target species relies not only on the species of interest being present at the sampling location but also on presence of their eDNA in the field sample, in the DNA extraction and that the PCR binds and captures the target DNA sequence. False negatives can happen at any stage along this pipeline, and therefore design of a robust eDNA sampling protocol must take this into account. Many projects either use extensive pilot studies or mathematical models to understand how many samples and replicates are needed to obtain the required overall sensitivity. The final experimental design should be matched to the observation process, and the question being asked, but some commonalities are valid for all eDNA projects.</p>
<p>The first thing that should be determined for each new eDNA project is the question that needs to be answered and the budget for the project. eDNA requires rigorous sampling and observing a species eDNA can generally be broken down into three different factors; the sample size, the molecular assay design, and field implementation. The goal and the project's budget will influence how much emphasis is placed on these factors. There has been a suggestion that when targeting rare species that there should be more sites sampled but less replicates at each site, whereas when more common species are targeted there should be fewer sites sampled but more intense sampling at those sites. However, many species have limited inferences about site occupancy or field time can be expensive or limited, for example, difficult to reach sites. In these cases, taking fewer samples in the field can be compensated for by increasing the number of replicates in the lab. The number of molecular replicates (qPCRs/PCRs) needed is linked to the probability of detecting eDNA in the samples. The higher the probability there is that there is eDNA in the sample present, the lower the number of molecular replicates, with a minimum of 4 suggested to detect eDNA at a site using qPCR.</p>
<p>Environmental DNA studies are not static, and it is not unusual for sampling protocols to change over time as methods improve and understanding of how different site characteristics influence occurrence, capture and detection of eDNA. The main ways that studies are designed is to start with a pilot project, mathematical models and lab experiments. Understanding the limits of qPCR assays for each new primer combination and capturing the extraction methods should be the first step when designing a new protocol. Using existing species knowledge, environmental data and mathematical models, combined with the project question, helps to design a robust sampling protocol that can be refined over time with or without pilot projects.</p>
<p>Two initial sub-projects are being designed to get this research underway. These are 1) a meta-barcoding project to survey for ground-dwelling invertebrates in a selection of FORESTCHECK northern jarrah forest sites that examine responses to fire history and 2) a pilot project to use eDNA to survey for two species of conservation concern. These are the rakali (native water rat) and one of its primary prey (the threatened <em>Westralunio carteri</em> mussel) in rivers around Perth and the south-west.</p>
<p>The FORESTCHECK project sites were selected using historical sampling data to include past metadata and previous studies. Five sites per plot were selected as the target is a broad presences/absences of invertebrate genotypes rather than a very fine in-depth species index project. Leaf litter and soil samples from the same location were collected to increase the range of invertebrates detected. Enough material from each site was collected to do multiple extractions to increase the likelihood of rare species detection and qPCR was selected over PCR for the amplification step as it has a higher detection rate for low DNA samples.</p>
<p>For the rakali/mussel project we are collaborating with both Rivers and Estuaries Science in DBCA and Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER). DWER's Healthy Rivers program has been used to determine sampling locations. Sampling methods in the field were based heavily on the public protocol released by the United States Geological Survey. As this project is very targeted, using both primers and probes that are species specific, and the project is currently in the pilot stage, fewer samples were taken in the field and more molecular replicates at the qPCR stage are being employed. These methods may change as the protocol is developed.</p>
<p>DNA from positive replicates will be pooled together to increase the DNA amplified from individual samples, and then sent for NGS at AGRF for sequence verification. Bioinformatics analysis of the resulting sequence data will be performed on the Pawsey high-performance computers, mostly following a modified PEMA pipeline. As much as possible, the sequences will be blasted against custom libraries created specifically for the WA region.</p>",granted,False,<p>None</p>,not required,True,granted,"<p>Genetic data will be published on a public database, most likely GenBank, in line with best practice guidelines.

3111,<p>SP 2012-008 Marine Monitoring Program: We will be utilising data collected by this program and have gained approval and will be working with project leader Tom Holmes.</p>,"<p>To conserve WAs marine biodiversity, a network of marine parks has been established under the principles of being comprehensive (incorporating all major bioregions), adequate (of sufficient size and number) and representative (representing all species of plants and animals found in WA), known as the CAR approach. The principal objectives of the CAR approach requires knowledge of ecological assets over a statewide scale and is complicated by a changing climate/environment, where marine habitats and species distributions are unlikely to remain static <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/5QOh"">(Pecl </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/5QOh""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/5QOh"">, 2017)</a>. Finfish are a mobile component of marine biodiversity and have been identified as a key ecological asset due to their high ecological and social values. Accordingly, finfish were identified as a high priority for research and monitoring across nine marine parks in WA <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/iAtd"">(Kendrick </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/iAtd""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/iAtd"">, 2016)</a> and a long-term monitoring program was established by DBCA in 2009 to collect information on the condition of finfish with respect to natural and anthropogenic pressures.</p>
<p>While data from the marine monitoring program provides an opportunity for understanding how fish assemblages differ according to zoning within and among marine parks <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/iDMX"">(Goetze </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/iDMX""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/iDMX"">, 2021)</a>, it does not collect data outside of marine parks. Environmental changes are leading to shifts in the composition of fish assemblages <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/kMUg"">(Cheung </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/kMUg""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/kMUg"">, 2012)</a>, and it is unclear how well the current network of marine parks represents fish diversity across the state. The proposed project will combine DBCA finfish monitoring data with information collected by external collaborators to assess fish biodiversity both inside and outside of WA marine parks over the last decade. This will include new information on fishes from the Kimberley marine parks, collected using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). This method is being used increasingly, to monitor fish assemblages in locations that divers cannot access safely <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/TxPG"">(Schramm </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/TxPG""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/TxPG"">, 2020a). </a>However, further research is needed to understand how data collected by ROV, compares to that of the current methods used to monitor fish assemblages (e.g., diver operated video). To achieve these goals, data will be collated in GlobalArchive (https://globalarchive.org), a centralised repository that allows users to store data in a standardised and secure manner, makes meta-data discoverable, and encourages collaboration and synthesis of datasets within the community of practice <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/QSKk"">(Harvey </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/QSKk""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/QSKk"">, 2021)</a>. This dataset will be synthesised and then analysed at a workshop that includes key collaborators and DBCA staff, with an overarching goal of describing state-wide spatial and temporal patterns of finfish composition and distribution.</p>","<ol>
<li>Collate a statewide finfish dataset with key collaborators to enable biodiversity assessments of fish inside and outside of marine parks, over the last decade.</li>
<li>Develop conversion factors that will enable the synthesis of DBCA finfish data (diver operated video, DOV) with legacy datasets (underwater visual census, UVC) and emerging methods (remotely operated vehicle, ROV).</li>
<li>Compare the composition, biodiversity and productivity of fish assemblages among marine parks relative to non-reserved locations.</li>
<li>Assess if the composition, biodiversity and productivity of finfish assemblages within marine parks has changed over time and if any changes correspond with climatic events or are due to fishing pressure.</li>
<li>Finally determine if these changes persist through time and whether patterns of change differ among parks located along the WA coast.</li>
</ol>","<p>The project will provide important information on marine park design and organization that will assist with adaptive management in a changing environment. It will also provide important evidence for marine park planning, should re-zoning or proposed marine parks arise. Further, it will increase the capacity and value add to DBCAs finfish monitoring program, through the provision of comparable data outside of marine parks and increased ability to produce and continue long-term time series data using historic and emerging methodologies. This state-wide synthesis of finfish data will assess whether the current system of marine parks is following the CAR principles to conserve the biodiversity of marine fishes across WA. Specifically, it will provide guidance on long-term marine park planning and management, and important information that can be used to determine where future parks may be best placed (Aim 3). It will also provide an improved understanding of how marine parks function in a changing environment (Aims 4 and 5). We will develop a standard operating procedure for collecting finfish data using ROVs and protocols for increasing the size/scope of finfish datasets, facilitating a better understanding of spatial and temporal trends in fish assemblages (Aim 1 and 2). The development of conversion factors will ensure that legacy data is &ldquo;future proofed&rdquo;, enabling compatibility with emerging methods due to technological advances (e.g., ROV surveys). By addressing these aims, we will enable the evaluation of WAs conservation management within a global context and provide scientific evidence to support an adaptive and therefore more resilient management framework for finfish in a changing environment.</p>","<p>Regional staff across multiple parks have provided support to the development of the project, and we will work closely with staff in the Kimberley to complete field work. I have also been working with the planning branch to ensure this information can be used to inform the plan for our parks initiative and marine park design principles. Findings from the project will be disseminated within DBCA via information sheets, meetings, and internal presentations, ensuring results are communicated with regional and planning staff. As results will also be of interest to international researchers and conservationists, they will be published in high-ranking peer reviewed journals, presented at conferences and circulated through social media.</p>","<table>

<p><em>a.) Collation of existing data</em></p>
<p>Stereo diver operated video (DOV) data collected by DBCA and external collaborators will be uploaded to GlobalArchive. While standard operating procedures for the uploading of baited video data exists, we will need to work with researchers from UWA to develop procedures for cleaning, uploading, and hosting DOV data on GlobalArchive. Data stored in GlobalArchive is secure and only collaborators that have signed a data sharing agreement will be able to access data. By uploading to GlobalArchive, data can be synthesised into one dataset using R scripts that ensure all data is clean and in a comparable format. DOV data is limited to shallow water reefs, so does not capture the full diversity of finfish within a location. However, data collected using baited video has already been synthesised following these processes and can be used in addition to DOV data to provide a more comprehensive assessment of finfish diversity. With the additional collection of data outlined in Aim 1b and the contribution of data from external collaborators, a state-wide finfish dataset ranging from the far south (Esperance) to the far north (Kununurra) of WA will be available. This will include inside/outside assessments of eight existing and two proposed marine parks (the South Coast and the Kimberley) and will consider variation in zoning schemes for existing parks.</p>
<p><em>b.) Collection of data in key data gap (Kimberley)</em></p>
<p>Because of the risks associated with diving in many Kimberley locations there is currently no DOV or UVC data available on finish within the region. We will therefore work with the Kimberley monitoring team and regional staff to collect finfish data using a stereo remotely operated vehicle (stereo-ROV) in coral reef habitats. In principle, similar sampling procedures (e.g. transect dimensions, stereo-video design and video analysis procedures) as used for stereo diver operated video <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/I0pe"">(Goetze </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/I0pe""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/I0pe"">, 2019)</a> can be followed using stereo-ROVs. However, a standard operating procedure that covers specific procedures for the use of stereo-ROVs for sampling fish assemblages will be drafted and submitted to a peer reviewed journal. As a starting point we plan to complete at least ten sites with 6 x 50 m transects within Kimberley Marine Parks in October 2022, using an ROV available through the Kimberley Program. This fieldwork will form a pilot study that can provide the baseline for ongoing monitoring of finfish in the Kimberley over time. This data will be used to compare fish assemblages in this region to the rest of the state (Aim 3).</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2: Development of conversion factors</strong></p>
<p>While there has been emerging research into the use of stereo-ROVs for sampling finfish and their comparability to other methods <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/GnzN+TxPG"">(Schramm </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/GnzN+TxPG""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/GnzN+TxPG"">, 2020a, 2020b)</a>, these studies have been localised and have not examined whether conversion factors are needed across the range of metrics used to monitor finfish. Conversion factors have been developed to increase the compatibility of fish biomass data collected by underwater visual census (the most commonly used method historically) to stereo diver operated video (the current method used to monitor finfish at DBCA), enabling broader temporal and spatial scales to be examined <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/5Vsn"">(Wilson </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/5Vsn""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/5Vsn"">, 2018)</a><strong>. </strong>The field component for comparing stereo-DOVs to stereo-ROVs has already been completed, with data collected by both methods simultaneously in both temperate (Jurien Bay Marine Park) and tropical (Ningaloo Marine Park) locations. Estimates of assemblage composition, species richness and the abundance/biomass of key species will be compared using permutational significance tests and location incorporated as a fixed factor. If metrics are found to differ significantly, conversion factors will be developed to enable synthesis of data between methodologies. Results from this comparison will be published in a peer reviewed journal.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 3:</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Biodiversity and productivity assessments inside/outside of marine parks</strong></p>
<p>Here we plan to map the diversity, functional composition and productivity of finfish in relation to WAs marine parks. The key metrics that will be examined include diversity (taxonomic distinctness and beta diversity), assemblage composition (biomass of major functional groups) and productivity. While methods for assessing diversity (Warwick &amp; Clarke 1995) and assemblage composition (Mouillot et al., 2013) are well established, a method for calculating productivity using a trait-based approach has only recently been described <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/KSBI"">(Morais &amp; Bellwood, 2020)</a>. Productivity will be calculated for each individual fish observed using the &ldquo;rfishprod&rdquo; package in R. Diversity, biomass of functional groups and productivity will then be compared inside and outside of each marine park, to assess whether marine parks (as a whole) are providing conservation benefits to marine fishes. We will also examine the potential of productivity to spillover from sanctuary zones (and other highly protected zones) into areas open to fishing. Previous assessments of spillover have used static metrics such as abundance and biomass (Halpern et al. 2009), whereas productivity is process based so will provide an assessment of the current status of finfish as well as their potential to support fisheries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major factor influencing the effectiveness of marine parks is the percentage of highly protected areas/zones within their boundaries (Sala et al. 2021) and the degree to which this highly protected zones are connected to each other (Goetze et al. 2021). These factors alongside key socio-economic (e.g., gravity) and environmental drivers will be incorporated into models, to assess the importance of design and environmental factors in driving conservation success within marine parks. A full subset modelling approach will be used to assess the benefits of marine parks across the range of metrics identified above (Fisher et al., 2018). Finally, areas with unique diversity and high productivity outside of marine parks will be highlighted, providing evidence for suitable locations to achieve a representative network of marine parks for finfish in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 4 and 5:</strong> <strong>Biodiversity and productivity assessments over time</strong></p>
<p>Finfish data collected through MSPs monitoring program (supplemented by external organisations) spans over a decade and covers both tropical and temperate environments (e.g. Esperance to the Rowley Shoals) across seven marine parks. This will enable a temporal assessment of changes in diversity, assemblage composition and productivity. Information on water temperature and key habitat status/health (collected by MSPs monitoring program), a proxy for human impacts (known as gravity; <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/afjI"">Cinner et al. 2018</a>) and other key drivers of fish abundance will be collected and modelled with these key metrics using generalised additive mixed models and a full subsets approach <a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/FzMH"">(Fisher </a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/FzMH""><em>et al.</em></a><a href=""https://paperpile.com/c/mb62Xl/FzMH"">, 2018)</a>. This will allow us to distinguish the effect of key pressures including fishing and climate change and how it has shaped the distribution of fish assemblages across the state over the last decade. These patterns will be related to the current system of marine parks, to understand how they are capturing biodiversity as the WA marine environment changes with climate.</p>",granted,False,,not required,True,granted,"<p>Video are stored on external HDs with multiple backups due to their large size, however, cloud storage is being explored through the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre.

2864,<p>No related projects.</p>,"<p>The Pilbara Olive Python (POP; <em>Liasis olivaceus barroni</em>) is an iconic threatened species confined to the Pilbara and adjacent northern part of the Gascoyne IBRA regions. Very little is known about its ecology, habitat preferences and conservation threats. It was described as a distinct taxon by Smith (1981) and recent genetic work has indicated its distinction from northern populations of the Olive Python (<em>L. o. olivaceus</em>) (Pearson, Spencer, Hillyer and How 2013). Pearson (1993) reported on its distribution and conservation status based on the few available Museum specimens and records submitted by the public during a postal survey. Information on the python's diet, home range and basic biology based on limited telemetry data, observations and roadkill specimens was summarized in Pearson (2007).</p>
<p>The POP is an apex predator consuming a diet of large birds, reptiles and mammals as an adult, including several species such as Northern Quolls and Rothschild&rsquo;s Rock-wallabies that are either threatened or have declined in abundance. The diet of neonate and juvenile pythons is unknown but may consist of frogs, small birds and lizards. POPs occur in a range of habitats, including ironstone, dolerite and granitic hills and their watercourses. They are primarily nocturnal, but may be encountered in the cooler winter months basking near shelter. Mating also occurs at this time. Females are &lsquo;capital-breeders&rsquo; and need to have sufficient body resources to develop and incubate eggs. It takes considerable time post-reproduction to recover lost condition, so it is probable that females skip one or more years before breeding again (Pearson 2007).&nbsp;POPs occur in several national parks and conservation reserves managed by the DBCA. It is WA&rsquo;s largest snake and a species of interest to the wider public and Pilbara residents in particular. It is a listed ""Vulnerable"" species under the EPBC Act and ""Threatened"" under WA legislation.</p>
<p>The threats faced by POPs are not well understood. Pearson (2007) listed the loss of important prey items such as rock-wallabies and quolls due to predators, habitat loss and modification due to open cut mining activities and infrastructure development; and on a local scale, increases in vehicular traffic due to resources projects and tourism with resultant roadkills. The loss of vegetation cover (shelter and ambush sites) due to grazing and trampling by stock in riparian areas may be significant factors for juvenile pythons and wildfire may remove vegetation cover over large areas and reduce prey resources.</p>
<p>There is need for better life history and biological information on the diet, habitat preferences for adults and juveniles, predators, reproductive frequency, and the location of important landscape features for nesting and mating to aid conservation planning and to establish appropriate monitoring protocols. This information is also required to develop sensitive monitoring techniques to assess the effectiveness of management actions as well as mining and infrastructure impacts. Radio-telemetry of POPs remains the most effective technique to collect such data (Tutt, Mitchell, Brace and Pearson 2002; Tutt, Fekete, Mitchell, Brace and Pearson 2004). Pythons can be fitted with transmitters that last up to 3 years (and can be replaced), so important life history parameters of this long-lived species can be determined.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The apparent broad habitat preferences of POPs for rocky and riparian areas has resulted in its invariable intersection with mining operations and infrastructure corridors, resulting in numerous EPBC referrals. Consultants working on behalf of resource companies to survey and monitor POPs have struggled to locate pythons and have not developed effective ways to monitor the impacts of mining activity on the species.</p>
<p>The monitoring of snake populations has been largely unsuccessful using standard vertebrate techniques such as mark-recapture or sighting surveys (Boback, Nafus, Adams and Reed 2019; Henderson, Hileman, Sajdak, Harrison, Powell and Bradke 2019). Several monitoring techniques have been/or are continuing to be used by consultants to mining companies. Occasional road transects encounter few pythons and so have no power to detect population changes or calculate population estimates. Automatic cameras at rockholes or waterpoints rely on infra-red and very rarely detect slow-moving pythons whose body temperatures may not be dramatically different from ambient. The monitoring of rock-wallabies or quolls as a surrogate metric for POPs has its own methodological issues to obtain reasonable estimates. POPs have such a diverse recorded diet that any link between their population size/trend and the abundance of these two mammal species is unlikely to be informative.</p>
<p>The collection of eDNA from waterbodies has been examined for monitoring, however Weeks and Tingley (2017) were unable to detect POP eDNA in 26 water bodies known to be frequented by POPs. Better knowledge of the species biology would assist in deciding when and where to collect water samples to detect POPs with eDNA. They appear to spend comparatively little time sitting in water and further, this tends to be in summer months when thunderstorms and cyclones lead to be elevated river flows (Pearson, unpublished; Tutt <em>et al</em>. 2002; Tutt <em>et al</em>. 2004) and likely strong dilution of any python eDNA in waterbodies.</p>
<p>A project is needed that resolves the unknown life history parameters of POPs important for its conservation; identifies threats to its current populations; and investigates effective monitoring techniques that help understand how land management actions (fire, feral predator control) may maintain or re-establish populations, as well as reveal any impacts of mining and other land uses (stock grazing) so that mitigation actions can be adopted if required.</p>
<p>The project will be funded from existing offset POP funds, with the possibility of further funds becoming available from future offsets. These could benefit the project with additional to enable more telemetry and running monitoring techniques in different seasons, with greater intensity and over longer time scales.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strategic Context:</p>
<p>Advice on Lialis olivaceus barroni (Threatened Species Committee 2008) as outlined below:<br />Research priorities that would inform future regional and local priority actions include:<br /><br />1. Design and implement a monitoring program.<br />2. More precisely assess population size, distribution, ecological requirements and the relative impacts of<br />threatening processes.<br />3. Undertake survey work in suitable habitat and potential habitat to locate any populations/occurrences.</p>
<p>The project is consistent with a number of the DBCA Animal Science Program activities including:<br />1. Address knowledge gaps to inform the effective conservation of threatened fauna species.<br />2. Provide scientific knowledge to ensure the effective and efficient monitoring of fauna species.<br />3. Identify, assess and apply emerging technologies and innovative approaches to fauna conservation<br />research.<br />4. Engage with the community to identify opportunities for involvement in fauna conservation research and to encourage knowledge transfer.<br />5. Build capacity to deliver fauna conservation outcomes by collaborating with other science providers,<br />government agencies, industry and NGOs.</p>
<p>The project aligns with the seven projects identified by Pearson and Morris (2011) in ""Project Plan- The ecology and conservation of the Pilbara Olive Python 2011-2016"" (Department of Parks and Wildlife):<br />1. Review of published and unpublished literature<br />2. Development of survey and monitoring techniques<br />3. Pilbara Olive Python genetics and population structure<br />4. Detailed field ecology of Pilbara Olive Pythons<br />5. Developing strategies to minimise Pilbara Olive Python mortality<br />6. Reducing the impact of mining and infrastructure on Pilbara Olive Pythons<br />7. Monitoring Pilbara Olive Python populations</p>
<p>A POP workshop was held in Perth in 2013 and identified the following research requirements:<br />1. Undertake a literature review; 2a. Develop survey techniques; 2b. Develop monitoring techniques: 2c. Better understand habitat requirements: 2d. Better understand breeding biology; 3a. Better understand prey<br />relationships; 3b. Better understand predator relationships.</p>
<p>The proposed project examines the most critical of the research priorities identified by these three documents, focusing on:</p>
<p>1. Reviewing available literature</p>
<p>2. Undertaking detailed ecological work to understand habitat requirements, diet and reproduction</p>
<p>3. Supporting efforts to resolve population relationships and structure with genetic techniques</p>
<p>4. Identifying conservation threats</p>
<p>5. Developing and testing survey/monitoring techniques.</p>
<p>The project has a projected life of three years, but may require an extension of work on reproduction for a further 2-3 years on account of the apparent low reproductive frequency of female POPs.&nbsp;</p>","<ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The project will use a variety of techniques to answer various aspects as outlined below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Documenting habitat preferences, diet, home range and reproductive behaviour</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Radio-telemetry will be the primary method used. Surgically implanted temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters (Holohil) will be placed into pythons using the technique of Reinhert and Cundall (1982) with modifications outlined by Pearson and Shine (2002). Up to 10 pythons at 3-4 sites will be tracked on an occasional basis throughout much of the year, with more intensive tracking during periods of mating, nesting and at the time of dispersal of young. Faecal pellets will be gently palpated from pythons whenever they are handled for the purpose of measurement or surgical implants to assist with documenting the diet.</p>
<p>Each time a python is located, its behaviour, body posture, body temperature and a range of environmental factors (vegetation type, microhabitat, air temperature) along with its location with a GPS will be recorded. Any faecal pellets that are found will be collected for use in dietary analysis. An automatic logger and receiver may be used to record incubation temperatures of brooding females and environmental temperatures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><em>Investigation of predation threats to juvenile pythons</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Previous radio-tracking of 14 adult POPs did not result in the loss of any individuals to predators (Pearson, unpublished). As adults, they are probably almost invulnerable to predators (without the possible exception of dogs, known to take adult carpet pythons in NSW; M. Fitzgerald, pers. comm.) Neonate and other juvenile cohorts are generally too small to implant with radio-transmitters, so I propose to trial &lsquo;NanoTags&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nano-pins&rsquo; (Lotek) to track juveniles. It is planned that if any radio-tagged females lay eggs, the surrounds of the nest will be fenced to capture the neonates when they begin to disperse. Nests would be monitored with regular visits and trail cameras. The small transmitters would be glued on with tissue adhesive to enable tracking over a few weeks to record their habitat preferences, dispersal and potentially predation events.</p>
<p>The other technique for investigating possible predators of juveniles is the use of rubber or plasticine models (Brodie and Janzen 1995; Bittner 2003; Bateman, Fleming and Wolfe 2017; Nordberg and Schwarzkopf 2019). Models in the shape and colour of small pythons would be placed in various microhabitats and positions to mimic real pythons. The models would then monitored to determine what predators are likely to attack small pythons. Trail cameras would be the primary monitoring tool for this, but inspection of the models for claw or teeth marks could be informative if the cameras fail to detect certain predators (such as snakes or goannas). At least five models would be set up in each microhabitat type with controls out in the open and run for five days (or longer if there are no initial attacks).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li><em>Reproductive frequency in female POPs</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Limited radio-tracking found that while male POPs are reproductively active every year, females probably breed less frequently, perhaps only every 3-4 years. The process of developing eggs and incubation can result in the loss of around half of the initial weight of female carpet pythons (Pearson, Shine and How 2002), and this is likely to be similar for POPs. Post-incubation female pythons are typically thin with poor muscle tone and may be more susceptible to mortality from disease or a failure to capture prey to recover body condition. Consequently, it may take a female POP several years to build up sufficient fat bodies to breed again.</p>
<p>Close-order radio-tracking will be undertaken of gravid females to determine reproductive frequency, locate their nests and to calculate the approximate hatching time for young to investigate juvenile dispersal (see point above). Once eggs have hatched, the egg shells will be recovered, if feasible, to record clutch size and potentially have them tested to see if the clutch was fathered by more than one python.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Comparison of monitoring techniques</li>
</ol>
<p>Detailed records will be kept on all search techniques used to locate pythons to provide data for a comparison of potential monitoring techniques. In addition, transects by day and at night (at least 10 per paired site) will be undertaken at study areas where telemetered pythons are present to assess the efficacy of visual surveys. Similarly, road driving transects will be used at Millstream NP where a ring road passes through an extensive area of POP habitat to determine the usefulness of this technique for locating and monitoring POPs.</p>
<p>The use of eDNA has been trialled for monitoring POPs but remains in its infancy as a technique. Curtin University (Prof Morten Allentoft and Dr Nicole White) have a proposed three-year project on eDNA monitoring and Biota Consulting also has a project looking at the use of genetic techniques for monitoring POPs. I will work with these groups to supply tissue and to collaborate on papers/reports.</p>",granted,False,,not required,True,granted,"<p>Radio-telemetry data will be entered into an Access database and analysed by various available packages on Program R (Leonard 2021). Non-parametric Kernel analysis will be the primary method used to examine home range differences. Data will be uploaded into Departmental databases for storage during and at the completion of the project.</p>
<p>Camera imagery will be examined and manipulated using the Program CPW with subsequent analysis of simple datasets in Excel or routines within R. Some GLMM modelling will be undertaken of data collected during model trials to examine the influence of microhabitat, season, time of day and possible interactions between these factors in explaining observed predation events.</p>
<p>Transect sampling will be analysed with Rdistance (Carlisle, Hoffman and McDonald 2018) or perhaps the newly available MBHdesign (Foster 2021) within R. I will liaise with colleagues within and outside the Department to keep abreast of the new packages available in R and how they can be used to provide more informative analyses for python data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

2213,,"<p>At the top of many emerging weed threat lists for the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia is stinking passionflower (<em>Passiflora foetida</em> var. <em>hispida</em> DC. ex Triana &amp; Planch. Killip; Passifloraceae), a perennial vine from South and Central America.&nbsp; In the Pilbara, the weed is rapidly expanding its abundance in areas with slightly higher moisture availability than the surrounding landscape, including coastal reserves in the Roebourne sub-region (e.g. Cape Range National Park, Murujuga National Park), riparian habitats across the region in particular at the Millstream-Chichester National Park. The Fortescue Marsh and Karijini National Park are considered highly suitable for invasion, although no records have yet been reported from high conservation value habitat in these areas. Recent work by CSIRO and the Department of Parks and Wildlife has clearly shown that this emerging threat tag is warranted for stinking passionflower (Webber et al. 2014).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant impediment for implementing effective weed management strategies for stinking passionflower is that very little is known about its biology and life history, particularly in countries where it has been introduced. &nbsp;Ecological and genetic characterisation of the weed is required in order to guide the search for suitable biological control agents. Stinking passionflower has a broad native range in South and Central America, a widespread cosmopolitan introduced distribution, and is believed to be a species complex comprised of numerous entities. Molecular analysis of Australian collections, in the context of samples from the native range and other regions and countries where the weed is introduced, will be used to identify and characterise the genetic entity(ies) present in the Pilbara, whether there are multiple origins of the Pilbara invasions, and to confirm the level of relatedness to native <em>Passiflora</em> species and commercial varieties. Based on the ecological and genetic characterisation we will be able to identify and prioritise a suite of promising candidate biological control agents from stinking passionflower&rsquo;s native range.</p>
<p>In recent times, stinking passionflower in the Pilbara and Kimberley has been significantly more invasive than in the Northern Territory and Queensland, suggesting the existence of different forms adapted to local conditions.&nbsp; We will test this hypothesis by molecular characterisation of Pilbara populations relative to less invasive populations to identify any signal of adaption (given the high selective pressure induced by the ecological traits) and to inform which populations to preferentially target for biological control. &nbsp;</p>","<ul>

3347,<p>None</p>,"<p>Ellen Brook catchment (716 km<sup>2</sup>) is a major tributary to the Swan Canning Estuary which is identified as the major contributor nutrient loads to the system (Kelsey, <em>et al</em>. 2010 &amp; Paraska, <em>et al</em>. 2022). A nutrient stripping wetland was established at the bottom end of the catchment in 2014 with the view to reducing nutrient load from the Ellen Brook catchment before it reaches the downstream estuary. While effective in reducing loads during winter and spring flows, the wetland is bypassed during low flow periods when baseflow continue to flow. This is important given the nature of soils in the catchment and shallow groundwater. Key performance indicators for nutrient (TN and TP) management of Ellen Brook have not been met in the past years (Swan River Trust, 2022).</p>
<p>Since residential development commenced in 1990s (following the EPA approval), Ellen Brook catchment has undergone significant changes in land use land cover (LULC) from a landscape dominated by trees, crop and farm, animal keeping and horticulture (&gt;85%) to partially converted into urban development. Given its location adjacent to the Gnangara Groundwater Mound, the Swan Valley and shallow groundwater, the rezoning from rural to urban raises concerns for downstream waterways and nutrient management. To satisfy the environmental approval condition in drainage and nutrient management, as well as provision of water and sewer services for urban activities, Better Urban Water Management framework (WAPC, 2008) have been adopted, which include key principles in drainage nutrient and irrigation management and water sensitive urban design.</p>
<p>To better inform land management policy and support decision making with respect to management interventions to reduce nutrient export from Ellen Brook catchment, a refined hydrological and nutrient model is required. In order to be effective, the hydrological model must take into account the contribution from surface runoff, subsurface flow (including baseflow and groundwater discharge) and needs to quantify nutrient export from specific land use types, to differentiate active and legacy source, to identify the sources and sinks of nutrient, and how they vary in space and time.</p>
<p>Due to the spatiotemporal dynamics of water fluxes (as transport) and biogeochemistry of dissolved solutes occurring within the catchment, estimating the contribution of subsurface transport to the overall catchment nutrient loading is particularly elusive and uncertain. Modelling water fluxes at a mesoscale catchment (basins whose area are within the range of 10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>4</sup>km<sup>2</sup>) such as Ellen Brook needs to address nonlinearity, scale, uniqueness, equifinality and uncertainty issues in the model parameters, as their effective quantities cannot be measured but need to be inferred by an indirect procedure called calibration (Kumar, <em>et al</em>., 2013).</p>
<p>This project utilizes state-of-the-art hydrologic simulations driven by observed hydroclimatic forcing using the distributed (2D) and processed-based <a href=""https://mhm.pages.ufz.de/mhm/stable/index.html"">mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM)</a> developed by Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (Kumar, <em>et al</em>., 2013) to perform the catchment-scale hydrological simulations over 14 years, from 21 October 2009 (the first record at upstream gauge) to 31 December 2023. The model features the multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique (Samaniego, <em>et al</em>., 2010) to integrate the spatial heterogeneity of physiographic characteristics of Ellen Brook catchment with distinct differences in topography between the west and east of the Gingin Scarp and corresponding landscape properties such as soil, vegetation and depth to groundwater.</p>
<p>Using MPR, parameters at a coarser scale, where dominant hydrological processes are represented, are linked with their corresponding ones at a finer resolution where input data sets are available. This is an advanced technique to: (1) reduce model overparameterization, (2) confine the parameterization search to realistic values, and (3) allow the transfer of model parameters from gauged to ungauged basin.&nbsp;</p>","<p>The project aims to generate a hydrological and nutrient export model for the Ellen Brook Catchment to estimate the catchment nutrient export based on sources (surface runoff, baseflow and groundwater-derived), land use categories<sup>*)</sup> (forest, crops, urban, rural, livestock, wetlands, and nutrient stripping) and pathways from the catchment to the estuary. The model will be a predictive tool enabling managers to understand the potential impact of climate and management scenarios on nutrient export.</p>
<p>*) forest land use includes trees, plantation, conservation.</p>
<p>*) crops land use includes viticulture, turf farm, nursery, horticulture, lifestyle block/hobby farm.</p>
<p>*) urban land use includes residential, transport, sewage, utility, recreation, landfill, drainage, manufacturing.</p>
<p>*) rural land use includes rural residential, unused-cleared-base soil, unused-cleared-grass, quarry farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>*) livestock land use includes farm animals, animal keeping.</p>
<p>Specifically, the project will address the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Estimate the surface water flux (discharge), baseflow, and regional groundwater contribution to the Ellen Brook catchment nutrient export.</li>
<li>Identification of active and legacy source contributing to stream nutrient load.</li>
<li>Estimate the relationship between nutrient export and change in land use and land cover (LULC).</li>
<li>Estimate the land use-specific nutrient export rate (with uncertainty estimates).</li>
<li>Predict climate change impact and catchment management scenarios on the Ellen Brook nutrient export.</li>
</ol>","<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-roman;"">
<li>Understanding of a relationship between a change in land use and land cover (LULC) (2009 to 2023) and nutrient export within the catchment, and relative contribution of baseflow and shallow groundwater to total nutrient export.</li>
<li>Understanding the effect of Water Management Strategies and Plans and Water Sensitive Urban Design measures in relation to nutrient export, including the impact that different nutrient management approaches might have on nutrient export.</li>
<li>Understanding contribution of active and legacy source contributions to nutrient export.</li>
<li>Understand how climate and catchment management scenarios will influence nutrient export and loads to the estuary.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>During the life of the project, reference group meetings are scheduled every 6 weeks. At the meeting, the project leader presents the project progress and discusses any issues that arise with reference/experts, project team members and stakeholders. This forms an on-going knowledge transfer process. Additional meetings will be organized as required.</p>
<p>The project leader will work with managers (State, local and NRM) during development of the model to ensure relevant datasets are incorporated. In addition, managers will be able to input advice into scenario development. Approaches taken in this project will form part of educational material to support managers/junior scientists in understanding model frameworks.</p>
<p>At the mid-point and end of the project, progress knowledge gained will be conveyed to the Swan Canning Water Quality Improvement Plan (SCWQIP) team within Rivers and Estuaries Branch (REB), the Ellen Brockman Integrated Catchment Group (EBICG), local government, DWER and other relevant teams within Rivers and Estuaries Science (RES) through presentations and publication.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Deliverables and time frames:</p>

<p>Detailed steps required to achieve the 5 specific aims are described below.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 1: <u>Estimate the surface water flux (discharge), baseflow and shallow groundwater contribution to the Ellen Brook catchment nutrient export.</u></strong></p>
<p>Detailed steps required to achieve Aim 1 include the model setup, calibration and validation described below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Ellen Brook mHM model setup&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>mHM is based on numerical approximation of dominant hydrological processes which include canopy interception, soil moisture dynamics, infiltration and surface runoff, evapotranspiration, subsurface storage and discharge generation, deep percolation and baseflow, and discharge attenuation and flood routing.</p>
<p>In each layer of soil horizons within the model, the incoming water in the form of rainfall, after accounting for the canopy interception, is partitioned into soil-water storage and exfiltration based on a power function depending on the degree of saturation of the corresponding soil horizon, which then infiltrate to the horizons underneath. Evapotranspiration losses from each horizon are modelled as a fraction of evapotranspiration which are dependent upon water storage capacity and the fraction of the vegetation roots in each horizon.</p>
<p>In the Ellen Brook mHM setup, three mHM levels will be prepared for the following scale with data sources presented in Table 1.</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-roman;"">
<li>Level-0: 100m grids of spatial morphological data: filled DEM (digital elevation model), slope, aspect, flow direction, flow accumulation, gauges, soil characteristics at 3 horizons (0-5cm, &gt;5-30cm, &gt;30-100cm), monthly LAI (leaf area index) of each land use type, land use types (1974, 1984, 2005, 2018), land cover (forest, pervious, impervious), and geology. All level-0 data files are in form of raster files. For each soil horizon, soil characteristics inputted into the model are upper and lower limit of soil particle diameter (mm), bulk density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>), clay (%) and sand (%).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Level-1: 1km grids, hydrological processes (model domain) which is also model output in a netcdf4 file.</li>
<li>Level-2: daily resolution of 1km grids spatial meteorological forcing (precipitation, air temperature, potential evapotranspiration) in netcdf4 files.</li>

<p>Daily simulation October to December 2023 will be run in a WSL2 Linux environment.</p>
<p>Outputs from the model (1km km spatial dataset) include:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-roman;"">
<li>Water content at each soil horizon (mm);</li>
<li>Volumetric soil moisture at each soil horizon (mm/mm);</li>
<li>Reservoir of sealed area and unsaturated zone (mm);</li>

<li>Potential and actual evapotranspiration (mm/day);</li>
<li>Total runoff, direct runoff, fast and slow interflow, and baseflow generated at every grid (mm/day);</li>
<li>Groundwater recharge (mm/day).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Ellen Brook mHM calibration and validation</strong></p>
<p>The mHM will be first calibrated using observed flow at the upstream gauging (617165) and downstream (616189), with contributing catchments 56.5km<sup>2</sup> and 554.4 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The second stage of the calibration is using time-series gridded soil moistures.</p>
<p>The options for optimisation scheme (4 option) and objective function (34) in the mHM will be assessed to produce the best fit for purpose optimisation scheme for Ellen Brook catchment.</p>
<p><strong>3. Groundwater level validation</strong></p>
<p>Simulated water level in groundwater storage within mHM setup will be analysed against measured groundwater level.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2: <u>Identification likelihood of active and legacy source contribution to stream nutrient load.</u></strong></p>
<p>Total runoff (Q) output of the model and nutrient concentration measured at 34 monitoring sites will be used to calculate nutrient load (L) at each site. Investigation of the L-Q at each site will be done using the regressions lines approach described in Destouni, <em>et al</em>. (2021).</p>
<p><strong>Aim 3: <u>Estimate the relationship between nutrient export and change in land use and land cover (LULC). </u></strong></p>
<p>mHM results (flow, soil moistures) and nutrient loading will be dissected spatially using land use land cover observed in 1974, 1984, 2005, 2018, and 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 4: <u>Estimate the land use-specific nutrient export rate (with uncertainty estimates)</u>.</strong></p>
<p>The land use-specific nutrient export rate (mg/ha/day) will be estimated using an inverse method described in Adiyanti, et al. (2022). Output from this approach is nutrient export rate (mg/ha/day) of dissolved nitrogen and phosphate during dry and wet periods, exported from each land uses, i.e., forest, crops, urban, rural, livestock, wetlands, and nutrient stripping.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 5: <u>Predict climate change impact and catchment management on the Ellen Brook nutrient export</u>.</strong></p>
<p>Daily potential evapotranspiration, precipitation and temperature derived from future climate 2030 and 2100 product of CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6) regional climate model (4km grids) will be applied into calibrated Ellen Brook mHM model to illustrate the impact of the climate change on the nutrient export. Selected shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) are SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0.</p>

2854,<p>SP2016-068: South West Threatened Fauna Recovery Project: Southern Jarrah Forest</p>,"<p>Feral cats are one of the most significant threats to native species in Australia with over 100 listed threatened species impacted by feral cats (Woinarski et al. 2014). Efforts to control feral cats have had mixed success with baiting practices having greater success in arid regions and much lower success rates in the southern jarrah forest (Wayne et al. in review). This appears to be largely due to the preference of cats to take live prey, which are more consistently available in higher rainfall, more productive environments.</p>
<p>The Felixer&trade; cat grooming trap is a novel method of controlling feral cats that takes advantage of their compulsive grooming behaviour. The trap consists of an auditory lure to attract cats and a series of LIDAR sensors, which when triggered are analysed using a series of algorithms to identify if the animal is a target (fox and cat), or non-target species. When a target is identified the trap shoots a sticky gel that contains 1080 poison onto the animal&rsquo;s fur. The fox or cat will then groom this gel from their fur and in doing so will ingest the poison and die.</p>
<p>Statistical and design modelling show that 4-8 &nbsp;Felixer&trade; grooming traps can remove &gt;80% feral cats from a 15,000 ha area in 4-8 week period (Brian Chambers, unpublished data). These models are based on the best available data and analyses on feral cats in the southern jarrah forest including home ranges and movement patterns from cats fitted with GPS collars (Adrian Wayne, unpublished data), and SECR-derived cat densities, detection probabilities and spatial information (Legge et al. 2017, Wayne et al. 2013, unpublished data).</p>
<p>SWCC has been contracted by the Department of Agriculture Water and Environment through the National Landcare Program to undertake a study of the effectiveness of Felixer&trade; cat grooming traps to reduce feral cat numbers in the Upper Warren and Muir-Byenup areas in Western Australia&rsquo;s south west. Numerous threatened species are found in this area including the woylie, western ringtail possum, chuditch, numbat and several bittern species (<em>Botaurus </em>spp.). Many of these threatened species have had large recent declines, with predation by feral cats having been identified as a major contributing factor (Wayne et al. 2017a &amp; b). Felixer&trade; traps have previously been tested in the presence of larger macropods and brushtail possums, and have been shown to reliably identify these species as non-targets (Dunlop et al. 2017; Read et al. 2019; Ecological Horizons 2018; 2020). As a precursor to this project, recent trials completed by SWCC and DBCA with captive numbats have also confirmed their safety for this species (Chambers et al. 2020). While there is considerable data for closely related species, Felixer&trade; trials in the presence of chuditch and woylies are currently limited or lacking.</p>
<p><strong>Felixer&trade; trap effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Felixer&trade; traps have been tested at several sites to determine their effectiveness at killing feral cats. The results of these published studies are summarised below:</p>
<p>Six Felixer&trade; traps were deployed in mostly open farmland over an area of 11.8 km<sup>2 </sup>(1,176 ha) on Kangaroo Island for 21 days.&nbsp; Prior to the Felixer&trade; traps being deployed 14 feral cats were trapped and fitted with VHF and GPS collars to track their movements and test the effectiveness of the Felixer&trade; traps.&nbsp; Feral cat density prior to the Felixer&trade; trial was estimated to be 2.98 cats/km<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp; Technical issues with some of the Felixer&trade; traps meant that the total lethal trap effort was significantly reduced, however, 13 feral cats were targeted by Felixers, eight (8) of which were collared.&nbsp; The estimates of feral cat density at the end of the 21-day trial was 1.69 cats/km<sup>2</sup>, a reduction of approximately 43%.&nbsp; The eight (8) collared cats killed by the Felixers moved between 220 and 2700 m from the Felixer&trade; site.&nbsp; The amount of time between being targeted and the cat dying ranged from 1 hour 41 minutes to 25 hours 23 minutes (Hodgens, 2019).</p>
<p>In a separate trial 20 Felixer&trade; traps were set over a 26 km<sup>2</sup> (2,600 ha) fenced enclosure in arid South Australia for six weeks. Six cats were radio collared prior to the deployment of Felixers with two targeted by Felixers and later found dead.&nbsp; Thirty-three feral cats were targeted by the Felixers during the trial, including 22 individually recognisable cats that were targeted and then not observed again on monitoring cameras set across the enclosure.&nbsp; Cat density was estimated at 1.84 cats/km<sup>2</sup> before the trial and 0.64 cats/km<sup>2</sup> after, a reduction of approximately 63% (Moseby et al., 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Felixer&trade; trap target specificity</strong></p>
<p>Felixer&trade; traps have been used in the presence of numerous native mammal, reptile and bird species and have been shown to consistently identify these species as non-targets (Ecological Horizons, 2020, 2018; Hodgens, 2019; Moseby et al., 2020; Read et al., 2019; Table 1).&nbsp; Early in the development of the traps some native species were identified as targets.&nbsp; In the study where tammar wallabies and other species were identified as targets this was found to be the result of a rock blocking one of the sensors.&nbsp; Improvements have been made to the targeting algorithms with only small domestic dogs occasionally mis-identified as targets in recent studies (Dunlop et al., 2019). Felixer&trade; traps have also shown to consistently identify humans and vehicles as non-targets (Dunlop et al., 2019; Hodgens, 2019; Moseby et al., 2020; Read et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Felixer&trade; traps were trialled at Perth Zoo using captive numbats to reduce the amount of time needed to attain the minimum 100 detections to determine safety for this species.&nbsp; Felixer&trade; traps were set in &lsquo;camera only&rsquo; mode with an additional motion activated infrared camera (Reconyx HC600) set approximately 2-3 m away facing directly towards the front of the camera.&nbsp; Felixer&trade; traps in camera only mode will record whether the animal triggering the camera is identified as a target or non-target.</p>
<p>Field trials of the Felixer&trade; traps in safe mode are required to demonstrate that there are no or acceptably low risks to non-target species such as chuditch that are not well represented in other Felixer&trade; trials elsewhere. A requirement of the approval processes is for a nonlethal (camera only mode) trial of the Felixer&trade; traps in the field for six weeks (&lsquo;Felixer Cat Grooming device &ndash; process for approvals&rsquo; document, Invasive Animals Program, DBCA, 2020). These trials will be conducted in the Upper Warren where the abundance of woylie and chuditch is relatively high.</p>
<h3>Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture modelling</h3>
<p>The design of trial sites, including site size, number and spacing of monitoring cameras, duration of monitoring and the spacing of Felixer&trade; traps were refined using the secrdesign package in project R.&nbsp; The following parameters were used in the simulations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Detector type: proximity</em></li>
<li><em>Detection function: Half hazard rate</em> - This model was found to be the best fit for the data gathered at Boyicup and Balban in the previous remote sensor camera trapping surveys (A. Wayne, unpublished data).</li>
<li><em>N Distribution: Binomial (fixed)</em></li>
<li><em>&rho; (Sigma): 2000m</em> &ndash; Sigma value modelled from A. Wayne (unpublished data) was 1952m. GPS tracking of 4 cats in the Upper Warren area found daily movement distances of 4084-7254 m (n=3) and home ranges of 4578-11,370 ha indicating that this value is conservative.</li>
<li><em>&lambda; (Lambda): 0.5</em> - Maximum likelihood estimated lambda value from Boyicup site (A. Wayne, unpublished data)</li>
<li><em>Cat density: 0.0006 cats/ha (0.06/km<sup>2</sup>)</em> - Densities estimated from Eradicat trials using spatially explicit capture recapture.</li>
</ul>

<p>The relative standard error decreases with greater trap spacings and is lower at any given trap spacing with more traps, or a longer monitoring duration (<em>Figure 1</em>).</p>
<p><em>Figure </em><em>1</em><em>. Relationship between camera trap spacing and relative standard error with varying numbers of traps and monitoring duration.</em></p>
<p>We aimed for a relative standard error of less than 10% and the power to detect a population size change of approximately 30% as a minimum. To achieve this the following combinations of trap numbers, spacing and durations were identified as possible options (Table 2).</p>

<p>A combination of 49 traps at 2000m spacings deployed for 56 days was chosen as the layout that would be used (i.e. a conservative approach).&nbsp; This gives us a site size of ~14000 ha, or 13.5km diameter circular site.</p>
<ol>
<li><a name=""_Toc42779421""></a><strong>ii) Felixer&trade; trap layout design results</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A maximum of eight Felixer&trade; traps are planned for use in the trial and we modelled four scenarios of deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 traps deployed for 28 days in a 4x2 trap grid: ~4300m spacing</li>
<li>8 traps deployed for 28 days in a 3x3 hollow grid (no central trap) : ~4000m spacing</li>
<li>8 traps deployed for 56 days in a 3x3 hollow grid (no central trap): ~4000m spacing</li>
<li>4 traps set for 56 days in a 2x2 hollow grid: ~6000m trap spacing</li>
</ul>
<p>The results of the modelling indicate that all of these trap layouts are capable of detecting all of the individuals present at the sites based on the expected cat densities (<em>Table </em>3).&nbsp; The number of potential recaptures also indicates that the Felixer&trade; traps should have multiple opportunities to target individual cats if they are not identified as a target when near a trap the first time. The estimated number of cats potentially killed is higher than the simple population estimate, as the number of cats potentially targeted by Felixer&trade; traps includes animals whose home ranges are primarily outside of the study area.</p>

<p><em>*Area includes a buffer of 0.5*trap spacings around trap grid.</em></p>
<p>A 3x3 hollow grid with 4000m trap spacings will be used for 56 days initially to determine whether this layout can remove at least 60% of cats (i.e. a conservative approach).</p>
<p><strong>iii) Sensitivity of design to variance in cat density and movement</strong></p>
<p>To estimate the impact of changing cat density on the merits of this survey design we ran scenarios with density at 50% (0.0003 cats/ha) with a corresponding 100% increase to &rho; (4000 m) and a scenario with density at 200% (0.0012 cats/ha) with a corresponding 50% decrease to &rho; (1000m).&nbsp; The results &nbsp;demonstrate that the survey and Felixer&trade; design is robust to variance in these parameters (Table 4).&nbsp; It may seem counterintuitive that more cats would be killed when the cat density is lower, but this is a result of the assumed greater movement distances which increases the number of cat homeranges that would intersect with the Felixer&trade; grid.</p>

<p>A scenario was also simulated with &lambda; reduced to 0.1 to simulate cats showing a level of avoidance of cameras and Felixer&trade; traps with density of 0.0006 cats/ha and &rho; of 2000 m.&nbsp; This scenario yielded an estimated 11.9% RSE and 41.8% minimum population size change detectable at p=0.05.&nbsp; This scenario also resulted in the number of cats estimated to be killed dropping to 16 with 50 potential opportunities for Felixer&trade; traps to identify and target these cats.&nbsp; The 16 cats potentially killed in this scenario is still greater than the estimated nine cats in this area bounded by the Felixer&trade; grid and therefore the design appears robust to changes in this parameter.</p>
<h3><a name=""_Toc42779423""></a>General Trial Design</h3>
<p>The stage 1 (effectiveness) trial will use a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) design using a single control site and two impact sites.&nbsp; Feral cats will be monitored using motion activated infrared remote sensor cameras (RSCs) to determine the efficacy of the Felixer&trade; traps at reducing feral cat densities. The Felixer&trade; trapping trials will be conducted at one of the impact sites first. Once completed, the second trial at the second impact site will be conducted. The monitoring of cats at the control site by camera trapping will be conducted simultaneously before, during and after the Felixer&trade; trap trials at both sites (Table 5).</p>

<li><strong>i) Trial sites</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Trial sites will be approximately circular with a diameter of about 13.5 km, giving an area of about 14,300 ha (Figures 2 - 5). At the estimated density of 0.0006 cats/ha (0.06 cats/km<sup>2</sup>) this equates to approximately nine cats in each site.&nbsp; Sites are separated by a about 10 km to ensure independence between sites.</p>
<p>In the two impact sites, eight Felixer&trade; trap sites will be deployed at approximately 4000m spacings. The Felixer&trade; traps will be located next to and facing on to forest tracks to substantially increase the encounter rate of introduced predators (e.g. Read<em> et al.</em> 2015a; Towerton<em> et al.</em> 2016; Raiter<em> et al.</em> 2018; Wayne et al. 2013, in review, unpublished data). The tracks used for Felixer&trade; trapping will be closed to public access using Regulation 44 provisions (Conservation and Land Management Regulations, 2002).&nbsp; Felixer&trade; traps will be serviced every two weeks with 1080 gels replenished as required. The number of gel capsules containing 8mg of 1080 will be limited to no more than 12 per machine, in accordance with DBCA&rsquo;s Invasive Animal Program requirements.</p>
<p>All sites are within the current Western Shield baiting areas and fox baiting will continue as normal at all sites.</p>

<h2>Camera monitoring</h2>
<p>Within each site about 50 camera monitoring locations will be used to assess the effect of the Felixer&trade; traps on cat density. Cameras will be laid out at approximate 2000 m grid spacings, with all cameras placed on tracks where possible. This will substantially increase cat detection probabilities (Wayne et al. in review, unpublished data) and therefore cat detection events. This will mean more data for SECR modelling that will allow more precise estimates of cat densities, thus enabling greater sensitivity in our ability to assess the effectiveness of Felixer&trade; traps to reduce cat numbers. However, it will also impose a bias in density estimates, meaning that the density estimates may not be accurate. The increased risk of theft by having the remote cameras located adjacent to roads will managed (see section below).</p>
<p>Wherever possible cameras will be installed facing south to reduce false triggers from the sun. Cameras will be placed on permanent metal stakes, or trees, with the motion sensor approximately 30 cm from the ground aimed at ~60-70<sup>o</sup> to the track to maximise captures.&nbsp; Cameras used will be a mixture of Reconyx&nbsp; HP2X, HC600 and PC900 cameras. Where possible a single camera type will be used across each site, the camera types will also be consistent over time at each site to avoid any impact of camera function in cat detection probability over time.&nbsp; Cameras will be set to high sensitivity with 10 pictures taken per trigger and no delay after each trigger.&nbsp; This should improve the chances of being able to distinguish individual cats for the SECR analysis.</p>
<p>During stage 1 of the Felixer&trade; trials (testing their effectiveness), cameras will be active at the impact and control sites for eight weeks prior to, during and after Felixer&trade; deployment trials. This will provide sufficient data to estimate cat densities immediately prior to and after the deployment trials. Data collected during the Felixer&trade; deployment trials will track changes in cat activity. Assumptions of &lsquo;closed populations&rsquo; during and after the deployment trials are expected to be violated due to animal mortality and recruitment, respectively. The implications of this assumption violation will need to be carefully considered during analysis and inference.</p>
<p>Cameras will be checked every two weeks while in use to ensure that SD cards do not become full and data is lost.</p>
<h2><a name=""_Toc42779428""></a>Photo processing</h2>
<p>It is anticipated that this project will generate in excess of two million images that will need processing.&nbsp; Several options exist for processing these photos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine learning imagery analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several options existing including, &lsquo;Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification&rsquo; (MLWIC), &lsquo;ClassifyMe&rsquo; and Wildlife Insights. MLWIC is an open source analysis package built in program R, it requires the software to be trained to identify the species present in the area. ClassifyMe is a windows-based application that has been developed by the NSW Department of Primary Industries and University of New England. SWCC has joined the closed beta testing of this software to evaluate its effectiveness.&nbsp; Wildlife Insights is a project being run by World Wildlife Fund in collaboration with Google to analyse camera trapping data.&nbsp; SWCC is currently in discussions with WWF to determine if this project may be a suitable means for analysing the data collected in this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteer processing through Zooniverse</li>
</ul>
<p>Zooniverse is a citizen science-based approach to identifying species from camera traps involving volunteers donating their time to classify images.&nbsp; Removing blank images (with no animals) from the photos would aid processing and checking of the classification is required to ensure the quality of the data produced.</p>
<h2><a name=""_Toc42779429""></a>Data Analyses</h2>
<p>Cat densities will be estimated using Spatially Explicit Capture Recapture (SECR), which relies on the individual identification of cats at different camera trap sites to estimate capture probabilities and therefore densities without having to estimate an effective trapping area which can create significant bias in density estimates (Despr&eacute;s-Einspenner et al., 2017; Efford and Fewster, 2013). Densities of feral cats will be calculated for each eight-week period.</p>
<p>To determine the efficacy of the Felixer&trade; traps the density of feral cats will be compared between paired sites using a BACI design to determine whether a significant reduction in cat densities has been achieved. The number of feral cats identified as targets and shot with gel will be recorded to determine the number of cats killed by the traps.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name=""_Toc42779430""></a>Adaptive Process</h2>
<p>The aims of the Felixer&trade; field trials are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Safety Assessment: Determine the safety of the Felixer&trade; grooming trap for use in the presence of the native fauna in the Upper Warren area, with a focus on those species not involved in other Felixer&trade; trials (chuditch and woylie).</li>
</ol>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Test: Determine whether Felixer&trade; grooming traps can reduce feral cat densities by at least 60% at a meso-spatial scale (&gt;10,000 ha) in the southern jarrah forests, Western Australia.</li>
<li>Optimise: Improve the efﬁciency and effectiveness of Felixer&trade; grooming traps by reﬁning the deployment design (i.e. adjusting spatio-temporal factors such as density, duration, mobility, location in the landscape)</li>
<li>Sustain: Identify how to maintain a reduction in cat densities to allow for the recovery of native prey species (i.e. investigate the timing, frequency and spatial scale of Felixer&trade; trapping required to overcome recruitment from breeding and immigration).</li>
</ol>
<p>The spacing and the duration of Felixer&trade; trap deployment at the sites will be modified based on the results obtained in the trial to date.&nbsp; Initially the goal of stage 2 is to establish if the planned deployment of eight Felixer&trade; traps for eight weeks can reduce feral cat densities by greater than 60%. If this goal is not achieved using the design described above, then other options such as moving Felixers at four weekly intervals or changing the spacing between traps will be explored.&nbsp; The options chosen will be informed by the camera data and the analysis of cat densities and movements between trap sites.</p>
<p>Should stage 2 successfully reduce cat densities by more than 60% at both impact sites, the trial will move on to stage 3 - optimising the efficiency of the Felixer&trade; trap deployment.&nbsp; Changes to the Felixer&trade; deployment will be informed by analysis of the camera trapping and Felixer&trade; data. Changes that may improve efficiency may include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Trap density/spacing</li>
<li>Duration</li>
<li>Timing (e.g. season)</li>
<li>Location at the meso (e.g. adjacent to tracks, hydrographic features) and micro scale (e.g. placement in relation to other physical features that may aid in concealment or exposure to cats)</li>
<li>Use of audio lures or other lures</li>
<li>Felixer&trade; trap settings</li>

1776,,"<p>Although a young field, the science of restoration ecology is rapidly growing and being incorporated into natural resource recovery and management strategies at a range of scales worldwide [1]. These restoration activities represent significant investment with a global market estimated at $100 trillion annually [2]. The recognition of poorly defined success criteria and a lack of long term monitoring have highlighted the need for the development of post implementation empirical evaluations of the quality of ecological restoration activities [3, 4]. Most recently, the field has focused attention on the joint roles that ecological and genetic processes play in ensuring plant populations are self-sustaining, functional and possess the adaptive evolutionary potential that provides resilience to changing environments and persistence in both the short and long term [5-8]. Recognition of how traits affecting reproductive functionality including flowering, fruiting, seed production and seed viability, along with pollinator services, plant mating systems, and patterns of pollen mediated gene dispersal work in concert to shape population demography and levels of genetic diversity is now widespread [9, 10]. This recognition has led to the hypothesis that the most ecologically and genetically viable restored populations will be those where reproductive outputs, plant pollinator interactions, levels of genetic diversity, mating systems and patterns of pollen dispersal most closely mimic those found in natural or undisturbed remnant vegetation. These populations may be more likely to persist in the long term and contribute to effective ecosystem function through integration into the broader landscape. The recent development of theory pertaining to biodiversity on old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs) adds an extra series of predictions that may yield a more refined understanding of how plant populations function and evolve in OCBILS compared to those on young, often disturbed more fertile landscapes (YODFELs). This body of theory has novel implications for the conduct and outcomes of restoration ecology [11] yet to be tested in large scale restoration programs.</p>
<p>Gondwana Link Ltd are leading an ambitious conservation and restoration initiative that aims to restore native vegetation, providing habitat connectivity and integrated ecosystem function at a regional scale [12]. The project is the largest environmental restoration project ever tackled in Australia and operates across the south west of Western Australia from the wet forests in the west to the dry woodland systems bordering the Nullarbor Plain to the east. There are a number of focus sites within this greater landscape and early restoration activities have been conducted within the &lsquo;Fitz-Stirlings&rsquo;; a 70 km section of fragmented mallee and woodland remnant vegetation located between the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Stirling Range National Park [13]. Three restoration sites within the Fitz-Stirlings provide ideal experimental locations at which to assess the success of current, state of the art, restoration activities in terms of ecological and genetic viability.</p>
<p><strong><em>This project aims to</em></strong> improve the adaptive management of already established restoration sites and the planning of future restoration activities by addressing a significant knowledge gap in the field of restoration ecology; that of how well ecological and genetic viability of restored plant populations is secured with different establishment regimes. Additionally, we envisage the Gondwana Link sites allowing us to assess the significance of considering landscape age and fertility (OCBIL theory) in restoration plantings. The project will be conducted at Gondwana Link restoration sites located within the Fitz-Stirling region of Western Australia. However, the outcomes will be of relevance to and will inform broader restoration initiatives in many other landscapes within Australia.</p>","<p>Specifically, the project aims to assess restoration success through a comparison of ecological (reproductive output, pollinator diversity and behaviour) and genetic (genetic diversity, mating system, pollen dispersal) function within restored populations in relation to that within positive target references of the surrounding undisturbed remnant vegetation.</p>
<p>The project envisages achieving these goals by obtaining measures of&nbsp; genetic diversity and mating system parameters for six target species, present at up to three restoration sites established with differing seed and seedling establishment regimes, for differing lengths of time and with different degrees of consideration of landscape age and fertility. These measures will be compared with populations of the same target species in surrounding undisturbed, remnant native vegetation that will act as positive target reference sites. For two proteaceous species more intensive genotyping of individuals and progeny arrays will allow detailed assessment of pollen dispersal.</p>
<h3>Objective 1: Evaluate levels of genetic diversity</h3>
<p>For each of the six target species, at each of the restoration sites at which they occur and in three remnant reference sites, 20 individuals will be sampled. This will include the 10 mother plants utilised in Objective 4. DNA will be extracted from all samples and all individuals will be assessed for genetic variation at 12 SSR markers developed for these species.</p>
<h3>Objective 2: Evaluate mating system parameters</h3>
<p>For each of the six target species, at each of the restoration sites at which they occur and in three remnant reference sites, 10 individual mother plants will be chosen and sampled and seed collected from each. DNA will be extracted from all samples and all mother plants will be genotyped at 6 SSR loci. 20 progeny from each mother plant will be genotyped. Mother and progeny data sets will be analysed.</p>
<h3>Objective 3: Evaluate patterns of pollen mediated gene dispersal in Proteaceous nodes</h3>
<p>For each of two Proteaceous target species&nbsp; a number of clumps of plants will be selected and all individuals within that clump will be sampled as potential father plants (these will be inclusive of some individuals sampled for Objective 1). Up to 200 progeny per species will be collected from sampled mother plants. DNA will be extracted from all samples and potential fathers and progeny genotyped with 12 SSR loci. The spatial position of all mother and potential father individuals will be recorded via GPS. Paternity of all progeny with known mothers will be analysed.</p>","<p>This project is significant in addressing a central problem for large scale restoration activities; that of assessing the capability of restoration populations to maintain ecological and genetic processes that mimic those of natural remnant vegetation. This is essential for maximising population demographic and genetic health and for the long term resilience, persistence and integration of restored populations in the broader landscape. However, there is a large degree of uncertainty as to the long term effectiveness of restoration programs [1, 3]. The outcomes of this project will provide practical recommendations on how the ecological and genetic viability of restored populations may be affected by different establishment regimes. The outcomes will provide a strong basis for cost effective investment of resources in achieving successful restoration through adaptive management of restored sites and for future restoration activities. The project is innovative in employing an integrated evolutionary approach to the field of restoration ecology, contributing to newly emergent theoretical guidelines for the assessment of restoration success as well as in couching research in the broad theoretical context of OCBIL theory which may prove to have important implications for the conduct and outcomes of restoration ecology in the Australian landscape.Research outcomes will identify strategies to develop resilient natural woodland ecosystems that can thrive in environments that are already altered and likely to experience significant ongoing changes.&nbsp;</p>","<p>This project will involve collaboration between The University of Western Australia (UWA), particularly The Centre for Excellence in Natural Resource Management (CENRM), Albany, the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority (BGPA), Perth, and DPAW. The management team have a strong publication record and publish widely in international peer reviewed journals spanning the fields of ecology, population genetics, restoration ecology, evolutionary biology, molecular ecology and conservation biology. Results of this project will be communicated via publications in peer-reviewed academic journals. Key objectives of the project will be achieved with synthesis of results in a final report that will be distributed to community groups and industry involved in ecological restoration. A public seminar and workshop will cement this communication strategy.&nbsp;</p>","<table style=""width: 520px;"">

Mother and progeny data sets will be analysed using the MLTR [44] software in order to obtain estimates of mating system parameters including, the multilocus outcrossing rate (t<sub>m</sub>), single locus outcrossing rate (t<sub>s</sub>), the apparent level of selfing due to biparental inbreeding (t<sub>m</sub> - t<sub>s</sub>), the correlation of selfing among maternal plants (<em>r</em><sub>s</sub>) and the multi locus correlated paternity (<em>r</em>p<sub>m</sub>).</p>
<h3>Objective 3: Evaluate patterns of pollen mediated gene dispersal in Proteaceous nodes</h3>
<p>For each of the two Proteaceous target species, a number of clumps of plants will be selected and all individuals within that clump will be sampled as potential father plants (these will be inclusive of some individuals sampled for Objective 1). Up to 200 progeny per species will be collected from sampled mother plants. DNA will be extracted from all samples and potential fathers and progeny genotyped with 12 SSR loci. The spatial position of all mother and potential father individuals will be recorded via GPS. Paternity of all progeny with known mothers will be analysed using the NEWPATXL [45] and the CERVUS [46] software. Paternity of progeny will be assigned and the spatial distances of pollen dispersal for a given progeny calculated as that between the known mother and the most likely potential father.</p>",granted,True,<p>Six.</p>,granted,False,not required,<p>Raw data sets including microsatellite DNA genotyping data sets will be deposited at publicly available archiving sites such as the Dryad Digital Repository and UWA Research Data Online.</p>,,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"",""Year 1"",""Year 2"",""Year 3""],[""Salaries, Wages, Overtime"",""135 489"",""152 272"",""103 214""],[""Overheads"","""","""",""""],[""Equipment"","""","""",""""],[""Vehicle"",""15600"",""5 200"",""5 200""],[""Travel"",""4 000"",""7 200"",""""],[""Other"",""112 730"",""2000"",""""],[""Total"",""265 319"",""152 272"",""103 214""]]"
770,<p>6.1 Barrow Island Threatened and Priority Fauna Species Translocation Program (in Prep) 6.2 Developing sustainable management systems for the conservation of biodiversity at the landscape scale in the Gibson Desert and Gascoyne Bioregions. (#2003/004) 6.3 The role of soil disturbance by native fauna in the restoration of Western Australia&rsquo;s rangelands&rsquo;. SPP# TBA</p>,"<p>Lorna Glen, 244 000 ha, is located 1100 kilometres north east of Perth, in the rangelands of Western Australia.&nbsp; It lies across the boundary of the Gascoyne and Murchison IBRA regions. It was established as a pastoral lease in the 1930s, and stocked at various times with sheep and cattle, until 2000 when it was purchased by the Western Australian Government for addition to the conservation estate.&nbsp; Earaheedy, the pastoral lease to the north east of Lorna Glen was also purchased by the Western Australian Government, in 1999.&nbsp; Both areas are currently Unallocated Crown Land and managed by the Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) in partnership with the traditional owners. The area now comprising Lorna Glen once supported a diverse mammal fauna that was representative of the rangelands and deserts to the north and east.&nbsp; These areas have suffered the greatest in terms of mammal declines in Western Australia (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989). &nbsp; The original vision for the Western Shield fauna recovery program was to expand introduced predator control and translocations beyond the south-west once an operational feral cat control program had been developed, and this was also recommended by the independent review of Western Shield in 2003 (Possingham et al. 2004). Mammal translocations to Lorna Glen are part of the first integrated ecological restoration of a rangeland property in Western Australia. Potentially Lorna Glen could support one of the most diverse mammal assemblages in arid Australia, and contribute significantly to the long-term conservation of several threatened species.&nbsp; Mammal reconstruction in this area will also contribute significantly to the restoration of rangeland ecosystems through activities such as digging the soil and grazing / browsing vegetation, and assist in the return of fire regimes that are more beneficial to the maintenance of biodiversity in the arid zone. During the process of translocation, and once populations are established, there is considerable potential for students and other researchers to study arid zone mammal biology and ecology and related issues. Mammal fauna A biological survey targeting small vertebrates was commenced on Lorna Glen in June 2003 (Cowan 2004), the aim of which was to determine the diversity and relative abundance of small mammals and reptiles on Lorna Glen, and to relate this to the optimum feral cat baiting period.&nbsp; A list of historic mammal records for the area within 200 kilometres of Lorna Glen has also been compiled, and a sub-fossil survey of Lorna Glen and parts of Earaheedy was undertaken in August 2006, to provide an insight into the mammal fauna of the area just prior to European settlement, (Baynes 2006). &nbsp; At least 36 species of non-volant mammal species occur, or once occurred, on Lorna Glen.&nbsp; (Baynes 2006, Morris et al. 2007, Cowan 2004). Of these 13 (three species of native rodent, six species of small dasyurid, two large macropods and the echidna) (36%) are still extant, 6 (17%) possibly still occur, but have not been recorded during recent biological surveys. Another 17 species of non-volant mammals probably occurred on Lorna Glen in historic times and of these 12 (33%) species are locally extinct, and 5 (14%) species are totally extinct (mainly medium-sized mammals). &nbsp; Introduced fauna control and fire management. Domestic cattle were removed from Lorna Glen after it was acquired by the WA Government in 2000.&nbsp; All artificial watering points (bores, dams) were closed off soon after.&nbsp; Cattle from adjacent pastoral leases did periodically wander into the property. However the completion of a cattle proof boundary fence around Lorna Glen in 2011 has now stopped this. The fence and culling program have also significantly reduced the numbers of feral camels on Lorna Glen.&nbsp; Feral goats are occasionally recorded in the north of Lorna Glen. Regular aerial and ground monitoring of camels, cattle and goats are undertaken to assess the effectiveness of management, and direct ongoing control programs. Rabbits occur on Lorna Glen at low densities and no control has been undertaken to date. &nbsp; Feral cat baiting has been undertaken since July 2003, and this has been successful at significantly reducing fox and feral cat abundance.&nbsp; Between 2003 &ndash; 2006 feral cats had been reduced from about 30 cats per 100 km to less than 5-10 cats per 100 km. Baiting was extended to 5km beyond the boundary of the property in 2011 to increase the baited buffer and provide better management of predators on the property. Aerial baiting and strategic trapping at Lorna Glen has maintained feral cat activity at approximately 7-11 cats per 100km for much of the subsequent period (a reduction of approximately 75% over pre control levels).&nbsp; Foxes are rarely detected. Wild dogs are also present and are controlled to some extent by the cat baiting program; A fire management plan has been prepared for Lorna Glen / Earaheedy (Muller 2006) and prescribes a series of strategically placed small patch burns aimed at reducing the spread of wildfires and promoting a range of age class vegetation which protect physical and cultural assets, as well as promoting biodiversity and protecting translocation and research sites in the future. This has been in practice since 2006. Mammal translocation program All species listed as locally extinct at Lorna Glen occur elsewhere in WA and could be reintroduced.&nbsp; It is proposed that 12 species be reintroduced to Lorna Glen over a ten to twelve year period (2007 &ndash; 2019), with one to two species being reintroduced in most years. The source of founders and the timing of reintroductions is dependent on the availability and status of suitable populations, which could include extant wild, stable translocated, and fenced breeding populations.&nbsp; A number of species (bilby, boodie, mala, western barred bandicoot, Shark Bay mouse, pale field rat, numbat and chuditch) may need to be bred in captivity, either at DEC facilities (Peron or RTD), or at Perth Zoo. The first translocation (bilby) occurred in August 2007, followed by brush tailed possum and mala in 2008.&nbsp; As an adaptive management response to the failure of some of these translocations, a feral predator free, fenced exclosure of 1100ha was constructed in 2009/10. It&rsquo;s aim is to facilitate a modification of translocation strategy for some species where various hypotheses proposing an acclimatisation period, and/or release of F2 generations to improve success, will be tested. Releases of boodie and golden bandicoot into the &lsquo;exclosure&rsquo; occurred in 2010, and their populations have rapidly increased in the absence of feral predators. An expansion is proposed to provide sufficient size to accommodate larger populations of some species for a longer period. A generic set of guidelines has been developed at the start of the project to broadly plan the translocation of each species. However these have and will, be modified to suit the species&rsquo; specific ecology, life history, behaviour, predator awareness and ability of the source population to support removal of animals. &nbsp; Literature review: Reviews of translocation outcomes across the world over the last 20 years (Short et al. 1992; Griffith et al 1996; Fisher and Lindenmayer, 2000; Short, 2009; Sheean, et al 2012; Perez et.al. 2012) indicate that a significant proportion, have resulted in failure, and there is often uncertainty as to the cause or causes of this. This lack of success, and inability to identify important causes of failure (or success) is usually attributed to deficiencies in one of 2 areas; 1) a lack of strategic design in the planning of the translocation programs&nbsp; with a paucity of testable hypotheses and a failure to clearly identify criteria for success (Armstrong and Seddon, 2007; Seddon et al. 2007; ); and/or 2) a failure to adequately monitor and measure success criteria, which may be due to one or a combination of either, a) the difficulties associated with trying to collect and statistically analyse data from small, cryptic, and elusive populations, and b) a failure to adequately commit resources to continue long term monitoring of the reintroduced population (often monitoring is severely curtailed or ceased after a relatively short period (1-3 yrs).&nbsp; Early survival and recruitment of the translocated population has often been monitored, but this has not extended through the full establishment and persistence phases. The faltering of these phases and concurrent reversal in population trends, leading to decline and extinction then goes unrecorded. At some later date, a revisit to the site fails to locate any individuals, and the dearth of data makes it impossible to determine what has &lsquo;gone wrong&rsquo; in the interim (Seddon et al. 2007). 1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There has always been an inherent tension in the dichotomy that exists between the 2 purposes of threatened species management and reintroduction science. Achieving management goals necessitates selecting, what is believed to be the best techniques and &lsquo;treatments&rsquo; that will provide the greatest likelihood of achieving successful conservation goals (i.e. long term establishment and persistence of the reintroduced population) drawing on all sources of prior knowledge and experience. The goal of research (prioritising the scientific method that uses a control and &lsquo;treatment&rsquo; hypothesis testing, experimental design, in order to maximise learning and identification of the critical variables that produce success or failure), risks &lsquo;wilfully sacrificing&rsquo; very valuable individuals of a threatened species in the process of pursuing (frequentist) statistical rigour. Scientific, conservation and ethical considerations, demand finding a balance between these competing needs. Clear development of success criteria and testable hypotheses, inclusion of adaptive management feedback processes, and Bayesian and modelling approaches to design and evaluation of projects can help to find this balance (Ewan et.al. 2004; Sheean et.al. 2012). 2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Failure of monitoring and analysis. a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;New techniques such as non-invasive genetic sampling and analysis, GPS satellite and RFID telemetry, IR camera trapping, are providing promising possibilities for additional tools which can assist in sampling elusive and rare species (Janecka et. al, 2011; Sugimoto et.al, 2012; Meek et.al, 2012; Roon et.al, 2005; Dyo et.al, 2009; Thomas et.al. 2011). In addition, recent work using non-parametric statistics such as Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo analysis and modelling approaches, are now providing tools that can more usefully analyse the type of limited data sets that are usually obtainable from the rare, small and elusive populations commonly produced in conservation and reintroduction biology. These new approaches can incorporate the wealth of previous and related experiments or specialist &lsquo;experience&rsquo; (expert knowledge) that often informs the design of the translocation protocols/experiment, into models which are then interrogated and refined with each new set of data that becomes available.&nbsp; (Wade, 2000; Gotelli and Ellison, 2004; Ewen et al, 2012) b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Failure to commit sufficient resources to continue monitoring at appropriate intensity and long term ecologically significant time frames, is often a political and economic issue that needs to be addressed at the start of any program, but it has been identified again and again (Armstrong and Seddon, 2007; Sheean et.al. 2012) as a significant factor that contributes to failure of a translocation program on both fronts (Management and Research); i.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Insufficient or inappropriate monitoring prevents early identification of changing parameters, which would alert the manager/researcher to declines in a timely fashion. This deficiency precludes any opportunity for active intervention that could reverse the decline and prevent extinction and failure of the translocation itself (monitoring as an essential part of adaptive management). ii.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Inadequate monitoring results in an inability to learn anything useful (even in hindsight) regarding the critical variables that lead to the failure (or success) of the translocation, due to a lack of information and insufficient data collection during the critical period (monitoring to provide data for scientific analysis and ecological understanding).</p>","<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To restore ecosystem health and function to the arid rangeland at the Proposed Lorna Glen Conservation Park, through reduction of impacts of feral / introduced animals and restoration of ecosystem services provided by reintroduced and extant native species.</p>

As such, it is not possible to detail all the specific methodology and appropriate statistical analyses which will be developed and utilised for each individual stage/component. The specific structure of survey/study design and analysis will often depend on the responses of the translocated species and the results of previous surveys and project components. The Project will develop over time and the knowledge and application of suitable methodologies and statistical analyses will also develop and change, in response to both direct results/outcomes of earlier stages of this Project, and to broader improvements in the general theory and application of reintroduction biology and ecological statistics. This is the basis of utilizing an adaptive management style approach.</p>
<p>Details relating to some specific project components are shown below;</p>
<p>TRANSLOCATIONS</p>
<p>A generic set of guidelines was developed at the start of the project to broadly plan the translocation of each species.&nbsp; Translocation Proposals approved by the Director of Nature Conservation have also been prepared.</p>
<p>The generic starting guidelines included: <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Translocations for each species to occur over two years (assuming translocation in first year is successful) i.e. initial release in year 1 followed by restocking in year 2.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Translocations to occur in May and August.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At least 40 founders per year (20 males, 20 females) will be translocated, at the same time.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At least 20 of these to be intensively monitored via radio tracking.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Monitoring would include an initial intensive eight week period immediately after release, followed by two week monitoring periods of radio-tagged animals every 6-8 weeks for at least the next 1-2 years after each release. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Additional monitoring of non-radio-tagged animals through trapping would occur at least every 6 months after this time and be restricted to cooler months between March/April and September/October each year.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Releases will be &ldquo;hard&rdquo; releases where possible, but some releases may involve a two stage process whereby a &lsquo;soft release&rsquo; or predator-free acclimatisation pen is used to allow species to adjust to new habitats and food sources, and increase population size prior to a second stage release into the wider property.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Source populations will also be monitored.</p>
<p>NB: However these have and will, be modified to suit the species&rsquo; specific ecology, life history, behaviour, predator awareness and ability of the source population to support removal of animals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reintroductions of locally extinct threatened mammal fauna (Bettongia lesueur, Isoodon auratus barrowensis, Macrotis lagotis, Trichosuris vulpecula, Lagorchestes hirsutus, Pseudomys fieldi,) 2007 to 2011/2012 and future (Phascogale calura, Dasyurus geoffroii, Perameles bougainville, Sminthopsis psammophila, Myrmecobius fasciatus, Petrogale lateralis, Rattus tunneyi) will utilise the following approach:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using proven techniques (considering factors such as, disease, genetics, small population dynamics, animal behaviour, habitat quality, predator management), and improving techniques of reintroduction for specific species in this habitat through an active adaptive management approach.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Monitoring the different phases of reintroductions, i.e. 1) short term [1-6mths] (early survival and dispersal); 2) medium [6mths &ndash; 2 yrs] (recruitment, population increase and dispersal), and 3) long term [2 &ndash; 20yrs] (continued population increase and dispersal, population stabilisation, establishment and persistence). &nbsp;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use of current well-proven monitoring techniques (radio-telemetry, cage trapping, spotlight monitoring, monitoring tracks and signs, habitat analysis), in combination with trialling and assessing appropriateness of new and emerging technologies that may prove better suited for rare, elusive and cryptic species. This may include; satellite telemetry, camera trapping, RFID &lsquo;trapping&rsquo;, individual identification and movement, and population demographics from non-invasive genetic analysis [hair/scat]; remote sensing technology [LIDAR].</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Statistical analysis will involve appropriate use of packages and approaches suitable to the type of data able to be collected. Some data sampling will be of the capture-mark-recapture format, and will be able to be analysed using traditional parametric ANOVA techniques. Data that is not able to be collected in a CMR framework to provide abundance measures, will still be able to provide information on other species parameters such as population demographics, activity indices, presence/absence and occupancy. Much of the data collected during the monitoring of translocations will reflect the characteristics of complex and variable ecological processes, adaptive management practices, small populations, and rare or elusive threatened fauna species which may violate the assumptions integral to application of the parametric analysis (random, independent sampling, and known distribution), and likely will require use of alternate approaches (Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo analysis). &nbsp;</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Appropriate software packages for statistical analysis will include; programs &lsquo;MARK&rsquo;, &lsquo;R&rsquo;, &lsquo;Presence&rsquo; <br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use of adaptive sampling designs which suit the population characteristics of the species and the ecosystem (e.g. Adaptive cluster sampling, two-stage or stratified sampling are generally more suited to different types, sparse, clustered, rare and/or elusive populations, than traditional random sampling techniques) <br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spatial analysis software for GIS mapping, triangulation and home range analysis (eg. ArcGIS, Ranges8, LocateIII, oziexplorer)<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Data management software used will include Access, CameraBase, and Cybertracker.</p>
<p>Translocation methodological approach.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Passive Adaptive Management (AM) &ndash; using expert knowledge and experience of target and related species, and other translocation practices to select and apply the techniques, which are expected to provide the highest probability of success for each species. Subsequent monitoring of clearly identified criteria of success, and based on analyses of these results, then inform decisions to continue with first strategy or modify techniques to increase the likelihood of success in future (Bayesian analysis and modelling).</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Active AM &ndash; Test specific hypotheses during translocation process in an experimental fashion. For example: <br />i)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H1. Parasite load reduces survival of individuals during and after translocation into a feral predator-free environment. (collect samples of ecto-parasites and blood born parasites, at time of translocation and subsequently at regular intervals post-release, to determine if subsequent survival, individual health and reproductive performance is influenced by initial parasite loads and treatment or non-treatment (control) of individuals to reduce parasite loads at time of translocation)?</p>
<p>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H2. Complete removal of feral predation threats through release into feral predator proof exclosure, will provide maximum survival, reproduction, recruitment and population growth?</p>
<p>Species monitoring programs</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reintroductions (e.g. bilby, brushtail possum, mala) directly translocated into wider LG area under aerial predator baiting regimes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Short term survival monitored using radio or satellite telemetry carried out on &gt; 50% of original release animals.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Medium term survival, reproduction and recruitment, individual condition and habitat use monitored using telemetry, standard systematic transect trapping within release area, and reproductive and morphometric measurements taken of individuals. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long term monitoring to track population establishment and dispersal, involving <br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;standardized track based surveys of signs (bilby, possum, golden bandicoot, boodie)<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;horse back based transect surveys of&nbsp; bilby activity and sign (burrows, diggings, tracks) off main vehicle track system in standard quadrat areas.<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Monitoring of release sites and potential habitats for signs of habitation (possum scats, claw marks around potential refuge habitat locations), and follow up with camera and cage trapping to determine population size, demographics and trends (multi-stage sampling).<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Opportunistic records of signs across property, collected by all operations personnel during works.<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Non-invasive genetic sampling (population sizes, demographics, distribution)<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Many of these techniques will be unlikely to be able to provide strict abundance estimates, but can, with additional validation trials, give valuable population indices, and provide useful spatial and temporal trends in presence/absence and occupancy across locations and habitats.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reintroductions (boodie, golden bandicoot, Shark Bay mouse, mala) translocated into predator free enclosure.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Short term survival monitored using radio or satellite telemetry carried out on a pptn of original release animals. <br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Medium term survival, reproduction, recruitment, individual condition,<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;radio and satellite telemetry to investigate home range sizes and habitat use (comparisons between sex and source populations). <br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;standard systematic transect trapping, and CMR to provide abundance estimates<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Haematological sampling and genetic analysis to investigate influence of disease/parasites on survival and reproduction.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long term monitoring to track population establishment and persistence, and adaptation to new environment, involving; <br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Systematic trapping and CMR study providing abundance trends over time and investigation of density-dependence (or independence) on population demographics and parameters.<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Genetic analysis to investigate hybridisation of different source populations in boodies.<br />o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Morphometric sampling of individuals to investigate apparent release of &lsquo;island effect&rsquo; on size in golden bandicoots. <br /><br />Other species monitoring programs will be developed using similar techniques and approaches, and tailored to suit the specific behaviour, ecology, population size and habitat selection.</p>

1505,,"<p>Since European settlement, 29 (9.2%) of Australia&rsquo;s terrestrial mammal species have become extinct, and another 57 species (18.3%) have declined significantly and are considered threatened (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). Predation by introduced predators (particularly the European red fox and feral cat) has been identified as a significant factor in mammal declines in Australia. In the 1980-90s, predation by foxes was shown to be a significant threatening process for native fauna (Kinnear <em>et al.</em> 2002, Morris <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2000). More recently, feral cat predation has been identified as a major issue (Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wayne <em>et al</em>. 2013) and Woinarski <em>et al.</em> (2014) regard this as the factor now affecting the largest number of threatened and near threatened mammal taxa.</p>
<p>Twelve species of terrestrial mammal have become extinct on the Pilbara mainland in the last 200 years, and another seven species have declined (McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2006). Fortunately, some of the species that have become extinct on the mainland still persist on offshore islands (Abbott and Burbidge 1995). &nbsp;A review of the conservation values, threats and management options for biodiversity conservation in the Pilbara (Carwardine <em>et al</em>. 2014) identified that for terrestrial vertebrates of conservation significance, feral cat control would provide most benefits but probably had a low chance of success. However, without cat control it is likely that another five species of terrestrial vertebrate will become functionally extinct in the Pilbara in the next 20 years, and another 18 species will continue to decline.</p>
<p>The northern quoll (<em>Dasyurus hallucatus</em>) is one of the seven Pilbara medium-sized mammal species that has persisted in the Pilbara bioregion (McKenzie <em>et al.</em> 2006). All of these species, except perhaps the echidna (<em>Tachyglossus aculeatus)</em>, have declined to some extent in the Pilbara, and three, including the northern quoll, are listed as threatened species. &nbsp;The northern quoll was once distributed widely across northern Australia from the Pilbara and Kimberley across the Top End to southern Queensland, but as now contracted to several disjunct populations (Braithwaite and Griffiths 1994, Oakwood 2008). An alarming decrease or complete collapse in once locally abundant populations of northern quoll has occurred in recent years as a direct result of the invasion of the cane toad, <em>Rhinella marina</em> (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2008; Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2010). Three other factors have also been identified as contributing to the decline of northern quolls and other medium-sized mammals across northern Australia: changed habitats through widespread fires, predation by feral cats, and novel disease (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2011). &nbsp;Due to these factors, the northern quoll is listed as Endangered under both the Commonwealth&rsquo;s <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </em>(EPBC Act 1999) and the Western Australian <em>Wildlife Conservation Act 1950.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Eradicat</em>&reg; feral cat bait will shortly be registered for operational use in WA and could potentially be used in the Pilbara to reduce feral cat (and fox and dog) densities and improve conservation outcomes for northern quolls and other threatened fauna such as the bilby (<em>Macrotis lagotis</em>) and mulgara (<em>Dasycercus </em>sp.). &nbsp;Prior to using operationally, potential non-target bait impacts have to be identified and resolved. As a top order native predator, the northern quoll is at a potential risk to poisoning after ingestion of the sausage baits. Based on a 1080 LD <sub>50</sub> of 7.5mg/kg (King <em>et al</em>. 1989), an average size Pilbara northern quoll (380-580g) would only need to ingest approximately one cat toxic bait to be at risk. Calver <em>et al. </em>(1989) identified that in the laboratory, the northern quoll was at risk from accidental poisoning from crackle baits containing 1080 for dingo control. However, King (1989) showed that an aerial dingo baiting program did not pose a hazard to free ranging northern quolls. A field trial using toxic cat baits and closely monitored northern quolls is the only certain way of assessing cat baiting risk to a free-ranging northern quoll population.&nbsp; Assessing the impact on quolls of baiting to control feral cats in the Pilbara is an important component in the development of a landscape scale program to control introduced predators and reduce the extinction risk for northern quolls and other medium-sized mammals in the Pilbara.</p>","<p>a) To assess the field uptake of feral cat baits <em>Eradicat</em><em>&reg;</em>by northern quolls <em>Dasyurus</em> <em>hallucatus</em>, and impact on survivorship.</p>

An approximately 20,000 ha site on Yarraloola pastoral lease (managed by Rio Tinto) will be baited with&nbsp; <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> feral cat baits, and another site at Red Hill pastoral lease, 60 km south of Yarraloola, will be used as an unbaited control site. The actual sites will be determined in March/April 2015 taking into account accessibility and presence of adequate numbers of northern quolls.</p>
<p>Habitat attributes will be recorded at all sites on Yarraloola and Red Hill where quolls are trapped using the standard habitat data sheets for the northern quoll Pilbara regional monitoring project (Dunlop <em>et al.</em> 2014). These will be incorporated into the regional predictive habitat modeling project currently underway with Edith Cowan University. Fire history and other disturbances such as livestock impacts will also be assessed.</p>
<p><strong>b) Cat baiting:</strong> Approximately 10,000 <em>Eradicat&reg;</em> feral cat baits will be dropped from a twin-engine aircraft at an altitude of 500 &lsquo;(agl) and travelling at 130kts, at a density of 50 baits / km<sup>2</sup> (Algar <em>et al</em>. 2013).&nbsp; Each bait will contain 4.5 mg 1080, and the biomarker Rhodamine B. The presence of Rhodamine is detected in animals as a pink dye around the mouth, in the gastro-intestinal track, and in scats and provides evidence that a bait has been consumed. Baiting will be undertaken in early July when diurnal and nocturnal temperatures are the coolest as this factor enhances uptake of baits by feral cats (Note: the effectiveness of cat baiting on feral cats is not being assessed during this trial). The track of the aircraft and GPS location of each cat bait drop will be recorded, and overlaid on known quoll locations (from trapping and radio telemetry) to ensure the quolls are in close proximity to cat baits and have the opportunity to consume them. Note that an indicative baiting cell will be provided to Western Shield by end of May 2015, but that this can be refined until mid-June, to ensure baits are dropped in the areas where quolls have been trapped, and move to.</p>
<p><strong>c) Northern quoll survivorship</strong>: The impact of feral cat baiting on northern quolls will be assessed by comparing survivorship at the Yarraloola and Red Hill sites, before and after cat baiting at Yarraloola.(BACI design). Survivorship will be assessed by two methods a) survival of radio-collared individuals at each site, and b) detection of quolls on a camera array.</p>
<p>The analysis of northern quoll survivorship will be undertaken using the Kaplan-Meier procedure, as used by Pollock <em>et al</em>. (1989). The survivorship rate of quolls (based on radio telemetry study) in the cat baited area will be included in a Population Viability Analysis (PVA, VORTEX: Lacy <em>et al.</em> 2009) to assess the longer term impact of cat baiting on the Yarraloola northern quoll population. Prediction of the risk of population extinction can be made using parameters such as demographic structure, mortality and survival rates, and reproductive rates (Brook <em>et al</em>. 2000). These can be derived either from this study (if available), from the Pilbara regional quoll monitoring program, or from other quoll demographic studies e.g. Oakwood 2000). The risk to the quoll population will be determined by examining the population trends provided by the PVA. The risk would be considered unacceptable if the PVA identifies that the population will decline to extinction.</p>
<p><strong>d) Northern quoll trapping and monitoring:</strong> Quolls will be trapped using transects of 50 small Sheffield cage traps baited with peanut butter, oats and sardines. This is similar to the methodology used by the northern quoll regional monitoring project (Judy Dunlop). Traps will be covered with a hessian bag for protection of any trapped animal, and placed in a sheltered, shady location. Traps will be set along rocky breakaways where quolls are known to be (from preliminary surveys). Trapped quolls will be weighed, measured and sexed, and a small tissue sample taken from the ear for DNA analysis. At least 20 adult quolls (380-580 g body weight) will be fitted with VHF neck mounted radio-transmitters fitted with mortality mode (Sitrack, 18g). These radio-collars will be tasked with operating only during daylight hours to prolong battery life for six months. A radio-transmitter failure rate of 10% is anticipated and will be taken into account when trapping quolls. It is intended to fit radio-collars to equal numbers of males and females, and to have equal numbers of quolls radio-collared at the Yarraloola baited site and the Red Hill control site. &nbsp;Quolls will be re-trapped in August to remove radio-collars. Trapping will be repeated in September/October to assess whether breeding is occurring (presence and persistence of pouch young). A small number of quolls may be fitted with GPS collars if pen trails with these new radio-collars are successful. These would provide information on movements and habitat use of the quolls before and after cat baiting.</p>
<p>Ground and aerial radio-tracking will be undertaken in the 4-6 week period prior to cat baiting and 8 week period post cat baiting to determine survivorship of the radio-collared quolls. If dead quolls are detected through the mortality signal, carcasses will be retrieved where possible and autopsied to determine cause of death. In particular, the carcasses will be examined closely for the presence of the Rhodamine B pink dye.</p>
<p>Two remote cameras (Reconyx Hyperfire HC900) will be set at each of the trapping transects to monitor presence of quolls at Yarraloola before and after cat baiting. Where possible individual quolls will be identified using their unique spot pattern (Hohnen <em>et al.</em> 2013). Remote cameras will also be used to monitor the uptake by quolls of non-toxic cat baits placed in front of cameras at the Red Hill control site.</p>

2875,,"<p>Wetlands across Western Australia reflect the broad climatic gradients and geomorphological variability found the state, and range from naturally saline intermittent playas to heavily vegetated freshwater swamps and permanent open water lakes (ANCA 1996). The large variability in wetland hydroperiod and water chemistry has resulted in high floral and faunal diversity and endemism, with approximately a half of threatened and priority ecological communities being associated with wetlands (Halse et al., 1993a; Halse et al., 1993b; Halse et al., 2004). Furthermore, these wetlands are critical feeding and reproductive habitats for various species of migratory and non-migratory waterbirds, including the endangered Australasian bittern (Halse et al., 1993b; Halse et al., 2004) and threatened fish. These ecological characteristics have resulted in twelve wetland systems in Western Australia being listed under the international Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (AGR 2006) and another 120 being recognized as nationally important through listing on the Directory of Important Wetlands of Australia (ANCA 1996). Many more high conservation value wetlands are distributed across the state and many reserves were specifically created to protect wetland assets.</p>
<p>Most wetlands across Western Australia are either threatened or currently being affected by a range of factors, including water resource development, agriculture and urban development, invasive species, mining, plant diseases, salinisation, and climate change (ANCA 1996; Lane et al., 2004; Lane et al., 2009). The Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) is responsible for managing wetlands within the Western Australian conservation estate, with management activities supported by monitoring and focused research. Monitoring of wetland condition and undertaking research are components of adaptive management programs, but resource constraints mean that such activities need to be targeted towards high priority wetlands, be collaborative, and use efficient monitoring technologies. This project focusses on filling monitoring and knowledge gaps for the State&rsquo;s Ramsar wetlands on the basis that internationally listed wetlands are the highest priority and that DBCA is largely responsible for their management, reporting on their condition and coordinating and updating management and information documents (Australian Government 2012).</p>
<p>Monitoring is a key component of managing and reporting on Ramsar wetlands (Storey 1997; Finlayson and Mitchell 1999) and each of the Ecological Character Descriptions have recommendations for monitoring, associated with limits of acceptable change (LACs) and conceptual models (Davis and Brock, 2008). These documents also list knowledge gaps, including those that prevent LACs from being adequately defined, which can also guide monitoring and research. Some monitoring has been undertaken at all Ramsar wetlands in Western Australia but this has usually been associated with short-term opportunistic projects or initiatives within regions or by other agencies or non-government organisations, and has lacked a coordinated approach (Auditor General of WA 2006). This project has been designed to fill priority monitoring gaps at Ramsar wetlands, and to provide consistency of monitoring and data delivery for key attributes. The focus will be on monitoring against, or informing, limits of acceptable change and/or to inform adaptive management programs, and will take a collaborative approach, within and external to DBCA, where possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The overarching aim of this project is to monitor spatial and temporal changes in flora and faunal communities of Ramsar wetlands and the underlying processes that drive these patterns. In particular, this project will;</p>
<p>1) Collate previously published studies and data sets on Ramsar sites to prioritize research and monitoring activities.</p>
<p>Most Ramsar sites in Western Australia are either the focus of ongoing monitoring programs or have been the focus of short-term studies. The results of these studies reside in various formats, including peer-reviewed journal publications, grey-literature (conference proceedings, reports, dissertations), databases and individual files. Thus, we aim to create a shared bibliography for publications focusing on Ramsar sites in Western Australia, which will allow DBCA to: i) report on the status of Ramsar wetlands, ii) identify priority monitoring and research needs, and iii) avoid duplicating previously conducted studies. We also aim to combine new and existing data into a single data repository that is accessible to DBCA personnel.</p>
<p>2) Monitor spatial and temporal patterns in wetland hydrology, water quality and vegetation structure as primary drivers of wetland biodiversity.</p>
<p>Ecological Character Descriptions (ECDs) for Ramsar sites recognise that hydrology, water quality, and vegetation structure are the major drivers of wetland biodiversity and 98 out of 156 Limits of Acceptable Change (LACs) relate to these variables. These gross habitat descriptors will therefore be used to track wetland condition, as changes in these key variables will potentially cause changes in wetland biodiversity. We will use a combination of remote sensing data, images collected using unmanned aerial vehicles, environmental sensors, and on-site work to track spatial and temporal patterns in these core drivers of wetland biodiversity.</p>
<p>3) Continue existing waterbird monitoring efforts and expand these efforts at select sites.</p>
<p>Most WA Ramsar wetlands were selected for their high value to waterbirds. While the criteria for Ramsar listing have broadened, waterbirds remain a focus at most Ramsar wetlands and 29 LACs relate to waterbirds. Waterbirds are also a major consideration for other high priority wetlands that have the potential acquire Ramsar listing in the future such as Lake Gregory, Fortescue Marsh, Lake McLeod, and Lake Carnegie. We aim to continue waterbird monitoring at a subset of Ramsar sites where monitoring is ongoing and expand regular monitoring to other sites.</p>
<p>4) Fill other gaps in monitoring data collected at Ramsar sites and other priority wetlands.</p>
<p>While aims 1 to 3 will constitute the core activities for this project across Ramsar wetlands, there will remain monitoring and knowledge gaps specific to each Ramsar site. As resources allow, we will work with relevant stakeholders and managers to fill these gaps. Initial examples include understanding the condition and drivers of thrombolite TEC in Lake Clifton and surveying for threatened endemic fish in the Muir-Byenup wetlands following recent changes in hydrology and water quality. This project will also analyse the long-term data set generated by the South West Wetlands Monitoring Program (1977 to 2016), using a variety of remote sensing methods to better describe hydrological regimes of south west wetlands and examine long-term trends in wetland depth.</p>","<p>Aim 1 &ndash; Reduced time invested in collating data for reporting. Clear map of where to focus efforts that address the &ldquo;knowledge gaps&rdquo; outlined in the ecological character descriptions.</p>
<p>Aim 2 &ndash; Improved ability to report on limits of acceptable change in the ECDs through direct measurements of habitat quality and quantity as surrogate indicators of broader wetland health and biodiversity values.</p>
<p>Aim 3 &ndash; Consistent data on which to base assessments of limits of acceptable change and listing criteria associated with waterbird populations.</p>
<p>Aim 4 &ndash; Site specific monitoring and research will provide local managers with information to assist with adaptive management of Ramsar wetlands and for Species and Communities Branch to report on Ramsar wetland condition and criteria.</p>","<p>General outputs - reports, peer-reviewed journal articles, conference and workshop presentations, contributions to working groups, provision of advice on condition and values for DBCA reporting, outreach materials, contributions to updates to the ecological character descriptions and Ramsar Information Sheets for each site.</p>
<p>Research results will also be communicated in ways that allow their inclusion in DBCA processes such as species and area planning and the work of recovery teams. Raw and processed data and associated interpretations will be securely stored in appropriate corporate and external databases and repositories. These outputs, together with research agreements will also allow knowledge transfer to external researchers such as those within government agencies and universities.</p>","<p>The project will operate across all Ramsar sites&nbsp;on a rolling basis, with each site visited at least five-yearly and some more frequently. More frequent monitoring of some attributes may be made where remote sensing allows data collection without visiting sites or where collaborations with regional staff and/or collaborations and funding from external organisations allow more regular sampling. Sites closer to Perth are likely to be visited more regularly for logistical/resourcing reasons. For some sites, such as Lake Toolibin, monitoring will be implemented opportunistically if the lake fills and is not mentioned here as a regional project routinely monitors hydrology and vegetation when the lake is dry.

</div>","<p><u>Aim 1</u>: The bibliography search for each Ramsar site will be conducted on two platforms: the DBCA library and Google Scholar. We have chosen Google Scholar because the search engine produces results of literature from both peer-reviewed sources as well as grey-literature sources. Given that each Ramsar site is often a collection of multiple waterbodies, we will conduct the searches using both the name of the Ramsar site as well as using each named waterbody at the Ramsar site. For example, the Peel-Yalgorup Ramsar site includes more than five named water bodies. Thus, we will conduct our literature search using &ldquo;Peel-Yalgorup&rdquo; as well as each named water body, including &ldquo;Goegrup Lake&rdquo;, &ldquo;Black Lake&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lake Mealup&rdquo;, etc.</p>
<p><u>Aim 2</u>: The methods used to monitor the key drivers of wetland biota (vegetation structure, water chemistry and hydrology) will vary depending on the element being monitored. However, a priority task will be to developing protocols to use unmanned aerial vehicles to track changes in vegetation structure. Members of the DBCAs Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis group are developing photogrammetry techniques using unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor changes in vegetation cover at various sites across Western Australia. We will collaborate with RSSA to assemble a protocol for the mapping of major vegetation structural units. In general, we intend to use 2-dimensional photos to map the spatial extend of broad vegetation groups (e.g., grasses, bare ground, shrubs, trees). We also intend to use methods to develop 3-dimensional maps of vegetation to also map aspects of vegetation structure (e.g. height). Once the protocols are developed, plots or transects will be established at wetlands of interests and vegetation mapping will be conducted on regular intervals to track temporal changes in vegetation structure. The interval at which mapping occurs will be site specific, but could be multiple times per year to once every several years depending on the needs of the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water quality variables will vary somewhat depending on the LACs and threats at each site but will generally include turbidity, pH, oxygen, redox, conductivity and macronutrients (N and P). Samples will also be collected to obtain current baseline data for dissolved metals. Hand held meters will be used or samples will be submitted to NATA accredited commercial laboratories.</p>
<p>Hydrological monitoring will be largely in the form of depth and extent of surface water, including through measurements on surveyed depth gauges (manually or through deployment of sensors and cameras), and through remote sensing products being developed for this project. The latter is a collaboration between Ecosystem Science Program and Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis Program&nbsp;Landsat images to model depth data from the former South West Wetland Monitoring Program (SWWMP, SPP2015-002) to develop a spectral index that correlates water depth with water presence/absence across a wetland. This approach is a &ldquo;gap-filling&rdquo; procedure that can transform intermittent measures of water depth into a more continuous record (e.g., biannual to monthly measures of water depth). To accomplish this we will compare an index developed by DBCA to traditional indices of water presence/absence, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index . Thus, we will derive several indices that relate water depth to remotely sensed measures of wetland inundation and then assess how well each index performs at identifying the spatial extent, depth, and volume of water at SWWMP wetlands. Furthermore, we will assess how sensitive these indices are to environmental factors, such as wetland geomorphology, fringing vegetation, and sun angle. These methods will be applied to analysis of the long-term trends in hydrology of wetlands in south west Western Australia.</p>
<p>Monitoring of groundwater will be undertaken as appropriate and where there is an established network of monitoring bores.</p>
<p><u>Aim 3</u>: All waterbirds on a wetland are counted and identified using binoculars and spotting scopes from the ground, unless the wetland is very large and then the portion of the wetland surveyed is documented. Boats will be used for deeper lakes where on-ground access is limited or not feasible. Aerial surveys will occasionally be conducted, sometimes via external contractors, on particularly large wetlands such as those in northern Australia. At sites in close geographic proximity to Perth (e.g., Peel-Yalgorup and Forrestdale and Thomsons Lakes) we will conduct multiple surveys per year to better understand intra-annual variability of waterbird numbers. At more remote sites (e.g., Ord River floodplain) we will aim to conduct surveys every five years depending on funding. Note that regular water bird surveys are already being conducted at multiple Ramsar sites, including Vasse-Wonnerup, Muir-Byenup, Eighty-mile beach, and Roebuck Bay and we will not replicate these programs while they are running.</p>
<p>An Animal Ethics project for ground surveys of waterbirds has been a approved.</p>
<p><u>Aim 4</u>: The short-term activities that will occur under Aim 4 cover multiple disciplines and thus the methods will vary depending on the activity. Below we provide methods for current and likely work.</p>
<p>Fish surveys will be conducted using a combination of fyke nets, seines, dip nets. In some situations underwater cameras, drones and/or eDNA will be used in addition to traditional methods. Fish identifications will occur in the field and fish will be released unless voucher specimens are retained and lodged with the Western Australian Museum. An animal ethics project for fish sampling has already been approved. Fish data will be provided to Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development.</p>
<p>Aquatic invertebrate sampling for biodiversity (presence/absence) usually involves sweep netting using techniques, mesh sizes and sample sizes that are compatible with all other DBCA aquatic invertebrate sampling (and which have become a standard outside of DBCA for some other research groups). Invertebrate abundance studies will be less common and conducted using standard methods such as water column/sediment cores or passive plankton samplers. Invertebrate will be identified to species/morphospecies level using a reference specimen collection held at Kensington and external taxonomic assistance is sought where needed.</p>
<p>Generally a combination of multivariate analyses including modelling and ordination/classification methods using data from the project in question and comparable pre-existing datasets. Species distributions and conservation assessments are made by comparison with previous records and ecological knowledge.</p>
<p>Collaborative projects &ndash; A number of sub-projects in which DBCA is a collaborator are still under development and methodological details cannot be provided at this time. However, DBCA will attempt to ensure that the methods used will follow best practices and that the results will assist in the management of wetland assets across Western Australia. Three projects are currently under development:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Lake Clifton thrombolite TEC is a significant asset within the Peel-Yalgorup Ramsar site, but several knowledge gaps are hindering DBCAs ability to design and implement a cost-effective monitoring program. In 2018 the Peel-Harvey Catchment Council (PHCC) commenced a five-year Ramsar project funded by the National Landcare Program. A key component of PHCC&rsquo;s project is to understand the environmental factors that influence the activity and condition of the Lake Clifton thrombolites. DBCA and PHCC are collaborating to develop projects whose results will form the foundation of a future monitoring program.</li>
<li>BirdLife Australia have applied for a Community Stewardship grant through the State NRM office to collect and analyse data on wetland birds through the extension of an established citizen science program. Management actions implemented by DBCA directly affect the health of wetlands throughout Western Australia. However, the current bi-annual monitoring program for shorebirds and wetland birds leaves a gap in our knowledge of how the timing and scale of management actions are impacting birds throughout the Peel-Yalgorup Ramsar site. Thus, we will assist in collection and management of environmental and waterbird data as well as assist in the analysis of these data sets in required.</li>
<li>A University of Adelaide Ph.D. student has commenced a study, co-supervised by DBCA's Josephine Hyde, exploring how environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling can supplement traditional biological survey methods in wetlands. Traditional survey methods have produced results that have significantly improved conservation management. However, survey methods are continually evolving, and eDNA is an emerging technology that shows promise as a monitoring tool. We will assist the Ph.D. student by collecting sediment samples from Ramsar sites across Western Australia as they are visited for this project.</li>

771,"<p>Rangelands Restoration, Lorna Glen fauna reconstruction (submitted). Effective control of feral cats (2003/005)</p>","<p>In 2009 the Gorgon Gas Project, a joint venture between Chevron-Texaco, ExxonMobil and Shell was given final environmental approval to establish a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant on the Barrow Island nature reserve. Barrow Island is a 'A' Class nature reserve that is recognized for its significant conservation values and as such the WA Government imposed a series of environmental protection conditions specified under the Barrow Island Act (2003). One of these was an offset program to be funded by the venture partners entitled the 'Threatened and Priority Species Translocation and Reintroduction Program'. The aim of this program was to undertake the reintroduction of threatened and priority Barrow Island fauna to areas of known previous occurrence as well as the introduction of taxa for the purpose of establishing 'insurance' populations on offshore islands and selected mainland sites. The targeted species were two birds, the white-winged fairy-wren (Malurus leucopterus edouardi) and the spinifexbird (Eremiornis carteri) and five mammal species, the golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus barrowensis), boodie (Bettongia lesueur spp.), spectacled hare-wallaby(Lagorchestes conspicillatus conspicillatus), northern brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula arnhemensis), and water rat (Hydromys chrysogaster). This program is consistent with management proposals for the Montebello Islands (Morris 1991) and the Rangelands Restoration project being undertaken at Lorna Glen (DEC 2010). Translocation of fauna is an important tool in ameliorating threatening processes (IUCN 1998, Seddon et al. 2012), particularly where anthropogenic causes directly impact existing extant populations of threatened fauna as in the case of the Gorgon Gas Project. The Gorgon Gas Project has provided a unique opportunity to undertake a number of well resourced re-introductions (establishing fauna in their former range, IUCN 1998) and conservation introductions (establishing fauna for conservation purposes in areas outside of their recorded distribution but within their ecogeographic area, IUCN 1998). Unfortunately, many fauna translocations to Australian mainland sites have not been successful, due primarily to the inability to effectively control the threatening process(s) and / or inadequate monitoring (Short 2009). These translocations from Barrow Island will be undertaken in an adaptive management framework, and in addition to potentially improving the conservation status of several threatened and priority fauna species, will be used to a) develop a translocation strategy for each species, b) assess the success or otherwise of the translocations, c) devise protocols for improving the success of mainland translocations, and d) determine the impact of grazing, burrowing and digging fauna on weed distribution on islands and the rangelands. The fauna translocation offset program will be funded for 12 years at a cost of c. $10 million. This provides adequate funding and timeframe to undertake the translocations and assess the long term viability of relocated populations. DPaW has the responsibility for administering the funding and the Science and Conservation Division will plan and implement the translocations, monitoring and associated research activities.</p>","<p>To increase the abundance and distribution of Barrow Island populations of threatened, priority and restricted fauna taxa through establishing additional populations on secure islands and in secure areas on the mainland.</p>","<ul>

<p>Targeted fauna species for translocation will be trapped / netted on Barrow Island, initially in the sites proposed for clearing by the Gorgon Gas Project. Other sites on Barrow Island will also be trapped / netted and these will be determined in consultation with Chevron and the Barrow Island DPaW staff. A desktop literature search of species distribution, land tenure and management will be undertaken to assess suitable reintroduction/introduction sites. Sites will be selected on the basis of known historical occupation by target fauna, secure land tenure and management to eliminate or reduce threatening processes. Where no previous record of occurrence is apparent then sites will be selected on their potential suitability in terms of habitat similarity and biosecurity. Importantly, prior to the translocation of any fauna, the cause of initial decline and extinction will be determined and management put in place to ameliorate / eliminate these. DPaW Regional / District staff will be closely involved in site selection. It is likely that most sites will be in either the Goldfields or Pilbara Regions.</p>
<p>Translocation sites will include the Montebello Islands, Doole Island, the Dampier Archipelago, Cape Range National Park and Lorna Glen proposed conservation reserve.</p>
<p>b) Control of threatening processes:</p>
<p>The most likely threatening process on islands will be black rats and/or feral cats and on the mainland feral cats / foxes / wild dogs. DPaW had eradicated black rats from several islands and feral cats on one island off the north-west coast and has and techniques are available to do this in the presence and absence of non-target species. Similarly, the control of foxes on the mainland can be achieved using existing baiting techniques, however the effective control of feral cats, and the need to control wild dogs / dingoes still requires research. If the translocation program is going to be dependent on effective control of cats and wild dogs/dingoes a separate SPP will need to be prepared.</p>
<p>c) Trapping:</p>
<p>All activities involving the capture, processing and transport of animals on Barrow Island will be approved by the DPaW Animal Ethics Committee and comply with AEC Standard Operating Procedures. All animal handlers will be experienced and hold the necessary permits to do so.</p>
<p>Founder mammals will be trapped on Barrow Island using Sheffield cage, Elliott and Thomas traps and transported to air-conditioned facilities in black heavy-duty cotton handling bags for processing. Mammals will be sexed, weighed, and have measurements of pes and head length taken. Age and reproductive condition will also be assessed. Each animal will have a Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag inserted between the shoulder blades for individual recognition. In addition, a small amount of ear tissue will be collected from all individuals at initial capture for genetic assessment. A sample of ecto, blood and endo parasites will also be collected from each species translocated. To improve the monitoring information gathered on the fate of translocated mammals, collar mounted radiotransmitters will be fitted to a sample of those translocated (except golden bandicoots where fitting radiocollars is problematic).</p>
<p>Founder birds will be mist netted at sites determined by the suitability and level of utilisation of habitat by the targeted bird species. The nets will be erected prior to sunset and checked and dismantled or furled through the night. Nets will be set again prior to sunrise, then checked and cleared prior to the heat of the morning, when they will be dismantled or furled if to be re-used in the same location. Some hand netting of targeted bird species may also be undertaken, as required and portable funnel-nets will be deployed as required.</p>
<p>All birds captured will be placed in calico bags in small, well-ventilated boxes and transported to air-conditioned facilities on Barrow Island. Birds will be weighed, sexed where possible and have the standard wing and body measurements taken. Processing will involve placing a colour coded ring on the leg of each bird for identification during future monitoring works at translocation sites; it may also involve the taking of swabs and feather and/or blood samples for health screening and genetic works.</p>
<p>d) Translocation</p>
<p>All animals to be translocated from Barrow Island will be transported either in a helicopter or fixed wing aircraft to reduce transport time to less than 12 hours. Mammals will be held individually in black cotton handling bags contained within pet-packs. All birds prepared for translocation will be held individually in small cardboard boxes and housed in pet packs. Animals will be transported to the Barrow Island airport just prior to departure and loaded into either a helicopter or fixed wing aircraft to mainland or island sites. DPaW staff will work in conjunction with Barrow Island airport staff to load pet packs into the aircraft. At the destination sites, animals will be unloaded from the helicopter / aircraft and checked for overall well being and condition before being released at pre-selected sites. Birds will be released in the mid-afternoon, mammals will be released at dusk.</p>
<p>e) Monitoring:</p>
<p>Each Translocation Proposal will provide details of monitoring and the success/failure criteria. Short term success criteria (up to 6 months) will be based on survivorship of founders and establishment of stable home ranges/movement areas. Medium term success criteria (6-18 months) will be based on continued survivorship of founders and some evidence of breeding success. Longer term success (18 months to 5 years) will be based on recruitment of new animals and expansion of the areas occupied.</p>
<p>Radiocollared / marked founder mammals and birds will be monitored intensively for up to eight weeks post-release. Providing monitoring indicates that survivorship of founders is high, monitoring will then be undertaken every six months for two years and then annually. Monitoring will be undertaken initially through radiotracking mammals fitted with radiocollars, or sighting surveys of translocated birds. Grid trapping will also be undertaken for mammals to assess the condition and reproductive status of translocated mammals. Tissue of animals recruited to the population will be taken for DNA analysis. The location of mortality events will be documented, and a post mortem examination undertaken to try to establish cause of death. If initial mortality rates are high (&gt; 50% in the first three months), further translocations will not be undertaken to that site until the cause(s) have been determined and ameliorated. Any changes required to monitoring frequency or protocols will be documented and included in future translocation proposals.</p>
<p>To assess the impact of grazing, digging and burrowing fauna on weed distribution and density, enclosures (minimum of two at each site, each 20mx20m) will be erected in weed infested areas prior to release of the founder animals. These control sites will be sufficient to exclude translocated fauna such as golden bandicoots, spectacle hare-wallabies and boodies. Comparable unfenced, experimental sites will be established nearby. Monitoring of weed (primarily buffel grass and kapok bush) distribution and density inside and outside the enclosures will be undertaken annually, at the same time each year, using randomised 1m x 1m quadrats. Remote cameras will also be positioned inside and outside enclosures to determine which species may or may not be feeding on weed species.</p>
<p>f) Analysis:</p>
<p>Morphomentrics and demographics: The morphometric measurements, age, sex and bodyweight data taken for all birds and mammals trapped and translocated will be stored on an MS Access database. A body condition index will be derived for each individual using a relationship between body weight and a measure of size such as pes or head length. Capture data from monitoring sites will be analysed to detect population trends using Program MARK and used to assist population viability analyses using VORTEX software. Population estimates will be undertaken using DISTANCE from either trapping or spotlighting transects. Estimates of population size and condition of translocated populations will be compared annually and reported in a DPaW Annual Report to Chevron.</p>
<p>Survivorship: Survivorship of founders will be determinedthrough monitoring the fate over time of radiocollared individuals, and trapping results.</p>
<p>Genetic assessment:Golden bandicoots and boodies will be targeted for genetic assessment, primarily through PhD studies.In particular theextent of mixing of Barrow Island and Shark Bay island boodie founders will be examined in the enclosure at Lorna Glen, as these two groups are quite distinct morphometrically (Shark Bay boodies are significantly larger). DNA will be extracted from the ear tissue biopsies taken from founder and recruit individuals. The level of allelic richness, heterozygosity and inbreeding will be determined following the methodology of Ottewell et al. (in prep) and others. A demographic and genetic model of population viability will be constructed using the software Vortex v9.99 (Lacey and Pollak 2012).</p>
<p>Weed distribution and abundance: weeds will be mapped annually inside and outside enclosures, and area of coverage compared.

714,,"<p>The northern quoll, Dasyurus hallucatus, is the smallest of all Australian quolls (300 &ndash; 1000g) and is restricted to five regional populations across Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, both on the mainland and offshore islands. The species distribution has declined gradually over the last 50 years with a number of threats, either directly or in combination with each other, thought to be contributing to the species decline. Threats include mortality caused by poisoning from cane toads, inappropriate fire regimes (and predation by introduced animals after fire) and the removal, degradation and fragmentation of habitat as a result of development actions, mining activities and pastoralism. The northern quoll is listed as a threatened (&lsquo;Endangered&rsquo;) species under the Commonwealth&rsquo;s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. A recovery plan has been prepared (Hill and Ward 2010), and the research proposed is consistent with the actions of this plan. &nbsp; Northern quolls occupy a variety of habitats across their current range including rocky areas, eucalypt forest and woodlands, rainforests, sandy lowlands and beaches, shrublands, grasslands and desert. Habitat usually requires some form of rocky area or structurally diverse woodland/forest for denning and shelter purposes with surrounding vegetated habitats used for foraging and dispersal. Northern quolls are a highly mobile species with home ranges in the northern parts of their range known to cover 100 ha or more. They reproduce once per year and have on average seven young. Many of the males and females have only a short lifespan, surviving for one breeding season. However where resources are more abundant some males and females will survive into their second or even third breeding season. Little is known about northern quolls in the Pilbara region of WA. Most information on the demographics, biology and ecology of this species comes from studies conducted in the Kimberley, Northern Territory or Queensland (Begg, 1981; Schmitt et al., 1989; Braithwaite &amp; Griffith, 1994; Oakwood, 1997 &amp; 2000). These studies have highlighted differences in the northern quoll&rsquo;s ecology between regions and populations and a need to address the gaps in our knowledge of the species in the Pilbara.&nbsp; Genetic studies indicate a primary genetic division between Western Australian populations (Kimberley and Pilbara) and Northern Territory / Queensland populations of the northern quoll (How et al. 2009).&nbsp; These authors further show that there is also marked genetic divergence between the Kimberley and Pilbara populations, and identify the Great Sandy Desert as a substantial and long standing barrier to gene flow.</p>","<p>The aim of this project is to improve our understanding of northern quoll population distribution, ecology and demographics in the Pilbara and provide information to environmental regulators and resource development companies that will allow appropriate management to ensure the persistence of resident northern quoll populations.</p>

<p>Pilbara-wide distribution/detection study: Motion sensor cameras will be deployed at up to 100 sites to record presence/absence data and patterns of distribution across the Pilbara region, and to assist in identifying key quoll habitat characteristics. This will also facilitate the identification of appropriate long-term monitoring sites.</p>
<p>Regional monitoring: Based on existing knowledge of the distribution of the northern quoll in the Pilbara region and consultation with landholders and regional DEC staff, surveys will be undertaken using motion sensor cameras (as described above) and preliminary trapping to identify sites where northern quolls are relatively abundant. Up to 9 monitoring sites will then be established across the region.</p>
<p>Disturbed areas monitoring: Disturbed areas have been identified by BHPBIO and include three quarries and two mining areas. These have been matched with analogue sites &ge; 5 km from the disturbed site.</p>
<p>Survey and monitoring:</p>
<p>Once suitable monitoring sites are identified trap locations will be fixed and marked for the duration of the study. Depending on the habitat present trapping array will consist of grids or parallel transects utilising small Sheffield wire cage traps (45 cm x 17 cm x 17 cm). Where grids are used, at each site one grid of 50 traps will be deployed consisting of 5 rows of 10 traps spaced 50 m apart with 100m between rows. In linear habitats two transects of 25 traps spaced 50 m apart will be used. Traps will be opened for 4 consecutive nights at each site (200 trap nights). Trapping will be conducted 2 times per year at each site. One trapping session will be conducted after dispersal on juveniles and prior to the onset of the breeding season (April-May) and the second after breeding activity has ceased (Sept-Oct) to obtain data on breeding success and male survival.</p>
<p>Effective trapping area for quolls will be estimated from movement data collected by radiotracking studies. Relative abundances and population densities can then be calculated and compared. Trapping will be supplemented with motion sensing cameras (10 per site).</p>
<p>All captured quolls will be implanted with a subcutaneous microchip for individual identification. Photographs of dorsal and lateral spot patterns will be taken to enable identification of individuals from motion sensor camera images.</p>
<p>Standard measurements of captured quolls will be taken &ndash; body weight, short pes length, head length, age estimation, sex and breeding condition. In addition, a small amount of ear tissue will be collected from all individuals at initial capture for genetic comparison, both within the Pilbara and with Kimberley, Northern Territory and Queensland populations.&nbsp; A small amount of blood will also be collected to screen for blood parasites. Scats will be collected opportunistically for dietary analysis and frozen for faecal steroid analysis. Morphometric, dietary, breeding and genetic information will be compared with other populations of northern quolls.</p>
<p>Radiotransmitters will be fitted to a sample of quolls at selected sites to obtain estimates of home range (using RANGES VII) and to obtain information on diurnal den sites. Field trials will be undertaken with GPS transmitters to establish whether a small enough transmitter can be developed to suit northern quolls. This would allow more accurate information on habitat use, home range, movements and denning sites to be obtained.</p>
<p>Impact of mining activities:</p>
<p>Additional trapping grids or transects will be established at disused mine sites and quarries that are / were considered to be suitable northern quoll habitat. Analogue sites at least 5 kilometres from each disturbed site will also be trapped. Captured quolls will be processed as above. Depending on survey outcomes and with the support of BHPBIO, it is possible that one or more of these sites will be incorporated into the Pilbara regional northern quoll monitoring program.</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>Existing records and preliminary trapping indicate that quolls have a wide distribution in the Pilbara region yet occur at relatively low densities with seasonal peaks in abundance. Because of anticipated low capture rates and seasonal fluctuations in population density it will be necessary to monitor over a long period to detect any changes or trends in abundance and demography in this species. If preliminary trapping success rates at long-term monitoring sites are low it may be necessary to reduce the number of sites and increase trapping effort over increased areas at fewer sites. Data will be analysed to detect population trends using MARK software and population viability using VORTEX software. Control charts will also be trialed for monitor long-term trends and status of quoll populations.</p>
<p>Habitat attributes will be recorded at all sites (including camera and trapping survey sites) and analysed to help predict the spatial distribution of suitable habitat and the probability of quolls occupying at locations based on environmental attributes.</p>",required,False,"<p>No northern quolls will be intentionally taken as specimens. however, if any are killed accidentally, or found as road kill, they will be lodged with the WA Museum.</p>",not required,False,not required,<p>Access databases will be established for this project.

2148,,"<p>Dirk Hartog Island is the largest island of the West Australian coast. Since the 1860s the Island was managed as a pastoral lease. In 2009 the Island was gazetted as a National Park and the process to remove introduced animals and enable a suite of 12 native mammal species to be reintroduced began. With the removal of large numbers goats and sheep came questions about the ability of the Islands native vegetation to recover and concerns regarding the proliferation of weed species (which would no longer be grazed). A monitoring program was developed which integrates detailed floristic surveys, repeated site photography and Landsat time series data to provide a comprehensive picture of how the Islands ecology has changed since destocking.</p>
<p>The integration of the ecological and satellite data has allowed present day observations to be put into context with the historical Landsat imagery. Statistical analysis of Landsat time series imagery at monitoring points identifies those at which vegetation cover has increased as a result of destocking. Field observations were then used to identify the species responsible for increases in cover. These data sources, when analysed together, allow management to have great confidence that, following destocking, the native vegetation cover is increasing at a rapid rate. Also that while introduced species, such as buffel grass, have increased in density, there is no evidence that it has increased in extent. Rather it appears that with the reduction in grazing native species are out competing buffel grass. This result provides management with confidence that vegetation condition in the Island is improving, that active revegetation programs are not required and that future mammal reintroduction programs have the best chance of success.</p>","<p>The data sets to be acquired and analysed will provide baseline measures of vegetation cover. These will be used to identify areas of degraded vegetation and, in the following years, will be used to monitor changes in vegetation cover including restoration of native species and spread of invasive species.</p>",<p>Monitoring using a combination of satellite imagery and field data will provide spatial and measurable changes in the vegetation cover that will be used to report against feral animal eradication and provide information to support the restoration of native species.</p>,"<p>Dirk Hartog Island:&nbsp;Return to 1616 team.&nbsp;</p>

Landsat vegetation trends and land management - geographically identifying the effects of Livestock numbers on vegetation in Dirk Hartog Island, in: Proceedings of the 7th International Symposium on Digital Earth (ISDE7). Presented at the 7th International Symposium on Digital Earth, International Journal of Digital Earth, Perth, Australia.</p>","<p>A monitoring program was devised to investigate and monitor changes in vegetation cover following destocking. The program was essential to determine the effect of destocking on the spread of weed species and to ensure that conditions on the Island are favorable for the reintroduced native fauna. The monitoring program utilises detailed floristic site descriptions, site and nadir photography which provide validation and attribution to temporal changes observed in the Landsat satellite data. The monitoring program has change imagery and time series analysis from Landsat imagery at its core. Field validation was designed with the &ldquo;Landsat scale&rdquo; in mind and also had to fit in with time and budgetary restrictions. The validation data also had to adequately convince manages that change observed in the Landsat imagery reflected actual change on the ground and to also indicate which species may be responsible for change. The data also had to provide an indication as to whether these changes were the result of management actions or part of a longer term cycle of vegetation change and succession.</p>
<p>Landsat imagery is central to the analysis. The Landsat satellite series began in 1972 and captures reflectance data at moderate spatial (30 m) and temporal (16 day) resolution. Following a new distribution policy agreed to by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the entire Landsat archive was made available for download free of charge. This has led to a dramatic rise in the use of Landsat data across an increasing range of end users (Zhu 2017). One such use is to provide a record of how land cover and ecosystems have changed over the past 40 years (Wulder et al. 2012). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The analysis and interpretation of Landsat time series data is a constantly evolving field. Examples of the evolution of analysis techniques include Thomas et al., (2011) who utilized temporal stacks of Landsat data, captured bi-annually between 1985 and 2005, to estimate rates of forest disturbance. Kennedy et al., (2010) developed the TimeSync segmentation process which simplifies and classifies temporal signatures from Landsat temporal stacks. Temporal stacks of Landsat data can also be used to predict forest structure. This was done for a mixed conifer forest by Pflugmacher et al., (2012) using the disturbance history of a site as described by the Landsat time series. Accuracies achieved were comparable to structure measures obtained from LiDAR data (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.80). The study demonstrates how the history of a site is important in determining its current structure.</p>
<p>The analysis of annual and bi-annual temporal stacks was developed further by Zhu et al. (2012) who developed a change detection algorithm that uses all available Landsat data to continually monitor forest condition. The algorithm developed by Zhu et al. (2012) was designed to detect significant disturbance events, such as forest clearing. However, standard time series analysis techniques (e.g. break point analysis and cumulative sum control charts) could also be used to interrogate more subtle changes in the Landsat time series.</p>
<p>While break point analysis can be used to identify points of change within a time series, control charts can be used to identify undesirable trends early and provide criteria for defining when management actions should take place (Gove et al. 2013).&nbsp; Control limits within control charts delineate thresholds within which points should fall if processes are progressing as expected (in control). Points moving beyond these thresholds suggest that there are abnormalities in the system (that it is out of control), and that investigation and corrective action is required (Montgomery 1997). Corbett and Pan (2002) recommended the use of cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts to monitor emissions data as they detect abnormal changes in a timely manner.</p>
<p>For satellite observations of vegetation cover change to be useful for management they required validation, to confirm a change has taken place, and attribution, to determine what is causing the change. Large events, such as fire, cyclonic activity and land clearing can be validated and attributed using sources such as the extensive online record of satellite imagery on Google earth (Pasquarella et al. 2016) However, small scale changes which require attribution to the species level, as is the case in this project, require field checking.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to monitor changes in the Dirk Hartog Island ecology following destocking of introduced herbivores. This was done by developing a monitoring program utilizing Landsat satellite imagery in combination with detailed, yet efficient, field checking techniques.&nbsp;</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,not required,,,"[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""FTE Scientist"", """", """", """"], [""FTE Technical"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]","[[""Source"", ""Year 1"", ""Year 2"", ""Year 3""], [""Salaries, Wages, Overtime"", """", """", """"], [""Overheads"", """", """", """"], [""Equipment"", """", """", """"], [""Vehicle"", """", """", """"], [""Travel"", """", """", """"], [""Other"", """", """", """"], [""Total"", """", """", """"]]"
1796,<p>Gilbert's Potoroo SP 1996-008</p>,"<p>Carpet Pythons are predators of a range of threatened mammal fauna (Pearson 2002, Pearson et al. 2002), including the endangered Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroo (draft Recovery Plan, Department of Parks and Wildlife 2016). Python predation, especially when populations are small or under pressure from drought or other predators, can potentially reduce adult survival as well as curtailing recruitment. This is particularly problematic when threatened mammal populations are highly confined by availability of habitat or if housed in enclosures for breeding or conservation. Current &ldquo;predator proof&rdquo; fences used to protect WA threatened mammal fauna, while effective at reducing or eliminating predation by foxes and feral cats, are likely to have little or no effect on levels of python predation.</p>
<p>The draft Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroo Recovery Plan (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2016) identified python predation as a significant threat to the growth of the potoroo population in the Waychinicup NP enclosure. A total of 49 potoroos have been placed in this enclosure since 2010 and there have been 8 known python predation events of potoroos with tail radio-transmitters. Since only a proportion of potoroos are fitted with tail transmitters at any time, the number actually taken by pythons is likely to be much higher. Tail transmitters typically only stay attached to the tail for 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>The estimated size of the potoroo population inside the enclosure in May 2016 was just 12 individuals. In a recent review of options following the Two Peoples Bay fire, it was stated that without management intervention, python predation was likely to cause their extinction within the enclosure (Tony Friend, options paper, December 2015). It appears that python predation is limiting population growth and hence the production of progeny for translocation to other sites.</p>
<p>The potoroo population at Two Peoples Bay was believed to be relatively stable between 2001 and 2012 (31 animals in 2008), but then declined to around one-third of its previous level (9 in March 2014, Friend 2016). Low rainfall rather than python predation was probably the main cause, but nonetheless predation pressure on a low population will stop or slow recruitment and recovery. Despite consistent production of young potoroos, the Waychinicup population has not shown strong growth. The low survival of founders compared with the Bald Island translocation, together with the generally good condition of individuals, indicates that a significant level of predation is likely to be a major contributing factor to the lack of population growth (Department of Parks and Wildlife 2016)..</p>
<p>Carpet Python Biology</p>
<p>Carpet pythons are known predators of a range of native mammals up to the size of tammar wallabies (around 3 kg). They hunt primarily by ambush and since prey are swallowed whole, there is pronounced niche partitioning between juvenile and adult pythons, and in some areas between the sexes (Pearson et al. 2002a). Carpet pythons typically hunt in the warmer months to ensure timely digestion of prey and may cease to eat and remain inactive for many months in areas with cool winters such as Dryandra (Pearson, Shine and Williams 2005). Prey are taken by large pythons on the ground, while juveniles hunt on the ground as well as from raised positions in shrubs or even in the canopy of trees. However observations at Waychinicup indicate that Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroos are taken by pythons all year round (Tony Friend, pers. comm.), which suggests that pythons are able to maintain warm enough body temperatures at Waychinicup to digest these relatively small meals (&lt; 1kg).<br /> Telemetered pythons typically move around 100m a week in the summer season between ambush sites at Garden Island and Dryandra. Home ranges averaged around 17 ha; however adult males travel widely in the breeding season to locate receptive females. Exclusive territories are not apparent, with adults and juveniles having home ranges that are overlapping (Pearson et al. 2005). Growth rates are strongly driven by prey availability and there is pronounced sexual size dimorphism with males rarely exceeding 1.5 m in length and 1 kg in weight, while adult females can reach up to 2.5 m and 4 kg (Pearson, Shine and Williams 2002b).</p>
<p>Python predation risk to Potoroos</p>
<p>The relatively small size of Gilbert&rsquo;s potoroos means that they are vulnerable to predation from a range of python cohorts &ndash; sub-adult and adult females and adult males. Predation is most likely in summer months when warmer temperatures allow more frequent feeding and growth. Large adult female pythons involved in reproduction do not to feed during egg development and incubation; this is likely to constitute around one quarter to one third of the adult female population in any given summer. However, once egg incubation is completed in March, these females have lost up to 50% of their post-oviposition weight, are hungry and will attempt to rapidly regain weight by feeding on whatever prey are available.</p>
<p>The home range is relatively small and non-exclusive, so densities of carpet pythons may be high if there is suitable habitat with abundant prey. Inside the 380 ha Waychinicup enclosure there is likely to be a substantial number of resident pythons, with some inflow and outflow by juveniles establishing new home ranges, as well as adults looking for prey; and in the breeding season, males searching for receptive females.</p>
<p>An options paper for the control and removal of pythons in the Waychinicup enclosure was prepared by Pearson and Friend (2016). It listed fencing, the removal of resident pythons by hand, trapping pythons and using radio-telemetry of adult males in the breeding season to locate female pythons. Retro-fitting the existing Waychinicup fence to make it python proof was considered by senior staff to be too expensive, so this proposal focuses on the location and removal of pythons within and around the enclosure to reduce the level of python predation on Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroo.</p>
<p>In addition, it may be possible to reduce python predation on the existing Mt Gardner population as it recovers from the November 2015 bushfire. In this area, the fitting of radio-transmitters to male pythons could assist in the location of adult females which are likely to be the most significant cohort preying on potoroos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>To determine the most effective ways to locate, trap and remove carpet pythons from in and and around Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroo populations and so significantly reduce the current level of python predation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>Reduced python predation of the critically endangered Gilbert&rsquo;s Potoroo, to prevent its extinction within the Waychinicup enclosure and so that recruitment is improved and more potoroos are available for translocations to other sites.<br />Since carpet pythons are important predators of a number of threatened mammals, the project would have applications beyond potoroo conservation and could assist with reducing python predation in other enclosures and even in field situations with wild populations if required.</p>","<p>Conservation managers and planners responsible for managing small populations of threatened species that may be threatened by reptile predation. This would include Parks and Wildlife operational staff and managers, but also be potentially useful in other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Application for animal ethics approval January 2017- Completed, animal ethics approved.</p>

3125,<p>This project is related to SPP 2012-034 'Genetic assessment for conservation of rare and threatened fauna'.</p>,"<p>The orange leaf-nosed bat (<em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em>) and the ghost bat (<em>Macroderma gigas</em>) were both once widespread across Australia but are now restricted to patchily distributed habitat across northern Australia (Woinarksi <em>et al.</em> 2014). Isolated populations of these species occur in the Pilbara bioregion where a distinct form of the orange leaf-nosed bat is recognised (hereafter Pilbara leaf-nosed bat, PLNB). As arid dwelling bats, both require cave roosting habitat within physiologically benign temperature (28 &ndash; 32&deg;C) and humidity (85-100%) limits which assist the species to maintain body temperature and limit desiccation (Baudinette <em>et al.</em> 2000). In this region, the deep caves suitable for use as diurnal roosts occur in a variety of banded-ironstone formations in the Hamersley Range and north of the Fortescue Valley, and which coincide with areas of active or future iron ore extraction (Cramer et al 2016, Cramer et al 2022). Consequently, both species are highly susceptible to habitat loss through mining. Indeed, it is predicted that most PLNB and ghost bat roost sites will be lost over the next 30-50 years if mining proceeds without constraint (Woinarksi <em>et al.</em> 2014). Both species are considered to be declining (PLNB in the Pilbara and ghost bat across its range) and are recognised as Vulnerable under State and Commonwealth environmental legislation.</p>
<p>Population size estimates in the Pilbara are currently ~2000 for the ghost bat (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2016) and ~13,000 for the PLNB (Bat Call WA 2021), although numbers are known to fluctuate dependent on environmental conditions (Bat Call WA 2021). Recent research prioritisation workshops hosted by DBCA (PLNB) and Curtin University (ghost bat, PLNB) indicate significantly more research is needed on locating and characterising diurnal roosts to understand their distribution and use, understanding the characteristics of foraging habitat and mapping its distribution, understanding movement and dispersal and estimating population size and demographic structure (Cramer et al. 2022; Cramer et al. 2016). A lack of knowledge on these aspects of ghost bat and PLNB biology, ecology and demography is hampering the ability of government regulators to adequately assess development impacts, especially cumulative impacts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Genetic data can provide valuable insights into both fine-scale and landscape-scale ecology of wildlife species (Ottewell &amp; Byrne, 2022; Hohenlohe <em>et al.</em> 2021). Early genetic studies of the ghost bat indicate a pattern of female philopatry and male-mediated gene flow (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1999) and a similar pattern of female philopatry may explain genetic differentiation between the northern and southern roosts of the Pilbara leaf-nosed bat detected in (Armstrong 2006). More recently genetic markers have been developed to implement novel non-invasive genetic monitoring techniques for the ghost bat (Ottewell <em>et al.</em> 2020). Genetic monitoring enables tracking of individuals through space and through time, which has enabled rich insights into ghost bat use of roosting sites, temporal fidelity of bats to caves and the spatial scale and frequency of bat movements between sites, as well as examination of these patterns between sexes (e.g. Sun <em>et al.</em> 2021; Ottewell <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>
<p>Ongoing research is required to integrate genetic, ecological and distributional data to address research priorities for Pilbara threatened bat species, as well as optimising genetic monitoring approaches for mark-recapture censusing of populations to estimate population size and evaluate bat responses to environmental and anthropogenic disturbances. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","<p>This project aims to provide an overarching structure to various research activities relating to threatened bat species in the Pilbara. Initially focussing on the Pilbara leaf-nosed bat and the ghost bat, the research aims of this project are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using genetic approaches, understand the historical and contemporary genetic diversity and landscape-scale genetic structure of Pilbara bat species</li>
<li>Using genetic approaches, understand the fine-scale patterns of genetic connectivity of bat populations and sex-biased dispersal</li>
<li>Undertake SNP genotyping of non-invasive samples for genetic monitoring of ghost bat populations as requested by internal and external collaborators/contractors</li>
<li>Provide reporting and interpretation of genetic monitoring data to internal and external collaborators/contractors</li>
<li>Undertake development and refinement of mark-recapture analyses specifically based on non-invasive samples to assist development of standard monitoring protocols</li>
<li>Integrate genetic, spatial and distributional data to identify and understand critical habitat for Pilbara bat species</li>
<li>Continue to develop and evaluate novel genetic resources or other technical approaches to research and monitoring of threatened bat species</li>
</ul>","<p>Research on the genetics, distribution, demography and ecology of Pilbara threatened bat species will inform conservation management approaches for the species to assist in their recovery, as well as provide guidance to industry and regulators in assessing mining development impacts.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Stakeholder groups within DBCA include Pilbara Regional PWS, Biodiversity and Conservation Science Animal Science and Species and Communities, and PWS Environmental Management Branch. External stakeholders include mining companies (BHP, Rio Tinto, API), environmental consultants, other government organisations (WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation, Qld Department of Environment and Science, federal Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment), as well as the broader scientific &nbsp;and general community.</p>

","The bilby (Macrotis lagotis) is listed as Vulnerable by under the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC, 1999), Schedule 1 - Fauna that is rare or is likely to become extinct under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 (WA Minister of Environment, 2012) and internationally listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN, 2012). The bilby once occurred over much of Australia (Marlow, 1958; Southgate, 1990a; Menkhorst, 1995; Abbott, 2001; Pavey, 2006), however a substantial reduction in numbers and distribution over the last 100 years (summarised in Pavey, 2006; DSEWPaC, 2012) has resulted in the bilby being listed as a threatened species.   
  
The decline in bilbies has been attributed to a number of threats working directly or in combination with each other. These threats are analysed in detail by Pavey (2006) and include mortality caused by inappropriate fire regimes (Southgate & Carthew, 2006, 2007; Southgate et al., 2007a), predation by feral cats and foxes (Paltridge, 2002), and the removal, degradation and fragmentation of habitat as a result of mining, pastoralism and other development activities (Southgate, 1990a; Pavey, 2006; DSEWPaC, 2012). The current distribution is now restricted to the Tanami Desert, Northern Territory (Johnson & Southgate, 1990), the Great Sandy and Gibson Deserts, the Pilbara and Kimberley in Western Australia (Friend, 1990), and an outlying population between Boulia and Birdsville in south-west Queensland (Gordon et al., 1990).  
  
Records of bilbies in the Pilbara region are mostly north of the Fortescue River (Figure 1) and likely a result of extensive pre-development surveys of rail corridors and other mining infrastructure in this area. Biological surveys recording evidence of bilbies in the Pilbara region are listed in Table 1.  
  
From the literature summarized in Table 2, suitable habitat for bilbies can be defined as level or undulating plains including watercourses and dune systems, composed of cracking clay, soil or sand that allows burrowing, with vegetation consisting of open-tussock Mitchell grass (in SW Queensland) or hummock grassland (spinifex), with low shrubland, usually Acacia dominated. Habitat which is steep and/or rocky which does not allow burrowing may be used for foraging if it is adjacent to suitable burrowing habitat. There are no published accounts of bilby habitat in WA. The decisive characteristic of suitable habitat for bilbies is the availability of a soil or sand substrate that enables the construction of burrows.  
  
A draft recovery plan was prepared in 2006 (Pavey, 2006), however this has yet to be finalised and approved by the relevant States, Northern Territory and Commonwealth. The work proposed in this SPP is consistent with actions in the draft recovery plan. The Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSEWPaC) have developed a Policy Statement which aims to develop significant impact guidelines for actions which are likely to have a significant impact on the bilby. The Policy Statement was developed for the following reasons:  
  
•    There have been an increasing number of referrals under the EPBC Act relating to potential impacts on the abundance and distribution of the bilby in the Pilbara.  
•    Several assessment sections within DSEWPaC were having difficulty in relation to determining significant impacts on the bilby  
•    There were inconsistent decisions being made in relation to the level of impacts on the bilby  
•    There are different threats affecting the bilby across its range, and  
•    Mining pressures were intensifying in Western Australia.  
  
The bilby is thought to be still reasonably widespread in the Pilbara but this bioregion is under increased pressure from mining exploration and extraction activities resulting in the removal and degradation of bilby habitat, and increased exposure to introduced predators.  
  

","<p>The aim of this project is to improve our understanding of the distribution, and demographics of bilbies in the Pilbara, and provide information to environmental regulators and resource development companies that will allow appropriate management to ensure the persistence of this species in the Pilbara.  </p>
<p>Specifically, the objectives of this project are to:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Gather recent and historic records in order to understand and predict the distribution of bilbies in the Pilbara  </li>
<li>Develop and implement a broad-scale survey technique  </li>

<p>Current and historic records of bilbies in the Pilbara will be accessed from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Published literature</li>
<li>""Grey"" literature (including consultant and DEC reports)</li>
<li>WA DEC, WAM and other national databases</li>
<li>Liaison with DEC staff, ecologists, consultants and land holders/users</li>
</ul>
<p>An online portal using a NatureMap Theme will be used to access the database of bilby records. This will be developed as an internal collaboration with DEC Science Applications. An online user-contributable data entry site will also be developed to provide the ability to maintain the database and keep it current with the addition of new records. This will be developed using the open source Atlas of Living Australia Biological Data Recording System (ALA, 2013) in collaboration with Gaia Resources and DEC Science Applications.</p>
<p><strong><em>2. Model distribution of bilbies in the Pilbara</em></strong></p>
<p>The distributional data gained from Section 1 will be used in conjunction with geology, regolith, soil, vegetation and climatic GIS layers to create a model of predicted distribution of bilbies in the Pilbara. Modelling will be completed using the software packages MaxEnt (Phillips <em>et al.</em>, 2004, 2006; Elith <em>et al.</em>, 2011) and ModEco (Guo &amp; Liu, 2010).</p>
<p><strong><em>3. Develop broad-scale survey technique</em></strong></p>
<p>Three survey techniques for detecting the presence of bilbies were tested for efficiency and reliability by Southgate <em>et al. </em>(2005). Their evaluation of transect, plot, and aerial survey techniques for detecting bilby sign (tracks, diggings and burrows) determined that aerial survey using helicopters was the most reliable, and cost- and time-efficient method of detecting the presence of bilbies. This method will need to be evaluated in the Pilbara where vegetation characteristics in areas occupied by bilbies may be different to the Tanami Desert, where Southgate <em>et al. </em>(2005) conducted their study. If vegetation in areas that bilbies occupy is denser, it may reduce visibility of burrows from the air.</p>
<p>Remote sensing techniques may also have the potential of detecting bilby burrows in the landscape. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) has recently been used to measure the height, shape and density of termite mounds across a landscape (Levick <em>et al.</em>, 2010) and detect old gold mine shaft entrances across a landscape (Utting <em>et al.</em>, 2010). This technique has the potential to be able to detect bilby burrow entrances across a landscape, through vegetation. A collaboration with Dr James Kellner (University of Maryland) has been initiated to trial the use of LiDAR in detecting burrows. Furthermore, the use of this technique extends beyond bilby burrows (eg rabbit burrows, boodie warrens) and has the potential to become an important land and pest management tool that DEC can benefit from.</p>
<p>Remote cameras can also be used as a tool for detecting the presence of species (Moen &amp; Lindquist, 2006; Meek <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Smith &amp; Coulson, 2012). Remote cameras will be trialed for their potential to detect the presence of bilbies. The number, distribution, spacing and length of camera deployment will be determined from a pilot study.</p>
<p>A minimum of 10 equal-sized areas that are known to have bilbies present (determined from Section 1 above and confirmed by ground-truthing) will be used to evaluate the three survey techniques described above. The number of detections of each monitoring technique per area will be recorded. A single factor repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to detect differences between techniques. The single factor (monitoring technique) has three levels, each measured at each site. Post hoc Tukey HSD tests will be used to identify differences between technique means. The size of the survey areas will be determined by a combination of the restrictions of time available for flights (both for helicopter and LiDAR aircraft).</p>
<p>The relative costs and efficiencies of each technique will be assessed using the method of Southgate <em>et al. </em>(2005) modified from Wiegart (1962).</p>
<p><strong><em>4. Broad-scale survey of Pilbara</em></strong></p>
<p>Once a survey technique has been determined from Section 3 above, it will be used to in a landscape-scale survey of the Pilbara. Areas for surveys will be targeted from the distribution modeling from Section 2. The number of survey sites across the Pilbara will need to be determined based on the costs of the selected technique from Section 3 above.</p>
<p><strong><em>5. Develop fine-scale population monitoring technique</em></strong></p>
<p>No reliable method of estimating bilby densities exists. Bilbies are trap-shy, are not consistently attracted to any form of bait, and reliably trapping an individual involves finding an occupied burrow and fencing it in with traps (Southgate <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Lavery &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997b; Moseby &amp; O'Donnell, 2003). Therefore, bilbies are not suitable for efficient mark-release-recapture studies. The use of tracks is an unreliable indicator of numbers, especially when densities are high (Paltridge &amp; Southgate, 2001; Southgate <em>et al.</em>, 2005b). Some surveys have made use of burrow counts (eg Burrows <em>et al.</em>, 2012), however the correlation between burrows and bilby numbers is poor (Southgate <em>et al.</em>, 1995; Lavery &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997b). A single bilby may use between three and 11 active burrows, sometimes up to 1 km apart, and may use up to 3 different burrows per night (Lavery &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997b; Moseby &amp; O'Donnell, 2003). Therefore, although burrows and tracks are a good indicator of presence, they are poor indicators of densities.</p>
<p>Reliable techniques exist for the extraction of DNA from bilby scats (Smith <em>et al.</em>, 2009), and polymorphic microsatellite markers have been developed for bilbies (Moritz <em>et al.</em>, 1997; Smith <em>et al.</em>, 2009) that are useful for both identifying individuals as well as population genetics. Distance sampling is a reliable technique of measuring densities whilst accounting for detectability (Buckland <em>et al.</em>, 2001, 2004). Using distance sampling to record the density of scats, coupled with genotyping of scats to exclude recounts of scats belonging to the same individual, will enable accurate estimation of densities. Three techniques of quantitatively sampling bilby scats will be evaluated: a) line transects with observers walking; b) line transects with observers on quad bikes; and, c) quadrat searches. The length of transects and size of quadrats will need to be determined, however a pilot study of foot transects in an area with bilbies yielded 2-3 samples per km; as a rule of thumb, 60 - 80 observations are required for reliable estimation of the detection function (Buckland <em>et al.</em>, 2001). Quad bike transects could have the advantage of covering more ground but possible at reduced detectability.</p>
<p>The experimental design for comparison of the three monitoring techniques will be identical as described in Section 3. Again, the relative costs and efficiencies of each technique will be assessed using the method of Southgate <em>et al. </em>(2005) modified from Wiegart (1962).</p>
<p>Genotyping scats will involve DNA extraction using commercially available faecal DNA kits, PCR multiplexing primers with fluorescent labels to reduce costs of both PCR and fragment analysis. Alleles will be scored using the GeneMapper (Applied Biosystems) software package.</p>
<p><strong><em>6. Long-term population monitoring</em></strong></p>
<p>Once the most reliable and efficient monitoring technique is determined from Section 5, it is the intent that the majority of populations used in Section 5 will become part of the long-term annual monitoring program. The exact number of populations to be monitored will be determined from Section 4.</p>
<p>It is important to note that some evidence suggests bilby populations can move across the landscape in response to or a combination of resources, predators and fire (Southgate &amp; Carthew, 2007; Southgate <em>et al.</em>, 2007a). Average dispersal rates of individuals have been recorded at 2.3 km year<sup>-1</sup> and one population was recorded having moved 10.5 km during a 3 year period (Southgate &amp; Possingham, 1995). Therefore, monitoring populations may not be restricted to a particular physical location, rather ""following"" and monitoring populations, where populations may need to be found again using the technique determined in Section 3. In such cases, population genetics can be used to confirm that it is the same population being monitored, since genotypes from previous years will be available for analyses using software such as STRUCTURE (Falush <em>et al.</em>, 2003) and GESTE (Foll &amp; Gaggiotti, 2006).</p>
<p><strong><em>7. Understand effects on demographics</em></strong></p>
<p>As described above, genetic data will be readily available from Section 6, therefore scope exists for extensive population genetics analyses using the software packages already mentioned. Furthermore, barriers to gene flow such as rail corridors can be tested using the program PARTITION (Dawson &amp; Belkhir, 2001).</p>
<p>Once population monitoring is established (Section 6), the monitoring other variables that the populations are exposed to will be developed. The variables to be monitored may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resources (abundance of food sources)</li>
<li>Densities of predators</li>
<li>Intensity of livestock grazing</li>
<li>Fire frequency and intensity</li>
<li>Proximity to mining infrastructure and other development</li>
</ul>
<p>Techniques for monitoring these variables will be developed and implemented as the project progresses.</p>
<p>Once data is gained on populations, Population Viability Analyses (PVA) will be used to predict population trends using the VORTEX software (Miller &amp; Lacy, 2005; Lacy <em>et al.</em>, 2012). Future investigations into life history parameters will be considered in order to increase the robustness of PVA and detect differences in life history parameters to Eastern bilby populations (NT, QLD). This will be planned and implemented as the project progresses.</p>",required,False,<p>Nil.</p>,not required,False,not required,<p>Distributional data will be uploaded into the Bilby database as detailed in Section 22.1 above.

827,"2009/003 Interactive effects of fishing and climate change on reef fish populations.
","Macroalgae are a prominent component of benthic communities along the North West coast of Australia. Within the Ningaloo lagoon large fields of macroalgae are a distinct feature of the marine park, covering ~2000 Ha (Casatta and Collins 2008; Beckley and Lombard 2012). These macroalgal fields are important habitat for fish targeted by recreational fishers (Westera et al. 2003; Babcock et al. 2009) and are a focal area for boating activity within the park (Smallwood et al. 2011). Moreover, large seasonal shifts in algal biomass on other tropical reefs (Glenn et al. 1990; Vucki and Price 1994) suggest macroalgae play an important role in nutrient fluxes in similar systems. Recent work by DEC and collaborators at Ningaloo has quantitatively assessed seasonal variation in biomass and diversity of macroalgal communities (Fulton et al. in prep) and assessed methods for estimating coverage of macroalgae using remote sensing (Radford et al. in prep). The proposed project will build on the information gained from these initial studies to improve understanding of how macroalgae are distributed within the Ningaloo lagoon and better define the role of macroalgal fields as habitat for fish recruits and adults.

Satellite and hyperspectral imagery provides broadscale information on the distribution of macroalgal fields (e.g. Mumby and Edwards 2002; van Keulen et al. 2008). However, this imagery does not provide details on the composition or structure of macroalgae within these fields. Nor does it consider how processes such as herbivory can influence algal communities. By combining remotely sensed information with algal community attributes and environmental conditions, models can be developed to assess the relative importance of physical and biological variables on patterns in macroalgal distribution and diversity (e.g. Ferrari et al. 2012). Such models improve understanding of how macroalgae are distributed at Ningaloo, and may be used in spatial planning to predict patterns of algal abundance and diversity in other locations.

Distribution patterns of macroalgae may also influence distribution and diversity of fauna. In particular, macroalgae have been identified as an important nursery habitat for fish (e.g. Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2007; DeMartini et al. 2010) and at Ningaloo some species recruit exclusively to the macroalgal fields in the lagoon (Wilson et al. 2010). This includes emperors (Family Lethrinidae), which are the main target of recreational fishers (Sumner et al. 2002). Fish recruitment within macroalgal fields is however spatially erratic. This variability may relate to specific attributes of algal condition and composition (Levin and Hay 1996) or the environment (e.g. depth, distance from backreef). Furthermore, post settlement predation is an important regulator of juvenile fish abundance (Almany and Webster 2006), and is dependent on the size and type of predator present (Holmes et al. 2012; Ticzon et al. 2012). The influence of habitat and predation on juvenile fish is often considered in isolation, however examining these factors simultaneously improves our understanding of the relative importance of these variables on juvenile abundance (Shima 2001).

The strength of annual recruitment pulses of fish, combined with post-settlement processes, such as mortality and migration, ultimately determines the size of adult populations. Monitoring juvenile abundance and the processes that regulate survival of these fish may therefore be used to predict the abundance of adults. This type of information is critical for understanding the resilience of systems, as adult herbivorous and predatory fish have critical functional roles on coral reefs. A robust understanding of how juvenile abundance relates to adult stock is also pertinent for management of species targeted by fishers. As recruitment of fish is inherently stochastic robust models that assess the relationship between recruits and adults are founded on multiple years of data. Work by Depczynski et al (2010) on recruitment of fish at Ningaloo provides a strong foundation for such models, although this information must be supplemented with data on the size structure of adults. As some fish species undergo ontogentic shifts in habitat (Lecchini and Galzin 2005), information on adult size and abundance from lagoon and backreef locations will be used to obtain a more holistic assessment of adult populations.
","<p>The overarching objective of this project is to better define the role of macroalgal fields in fish recruitment and adult abundance. This is divided into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quantify spatial variance in macroalgal fields at Ningaloo and examine the relative importance of physical and biological drivers of algal abundance and diversity.</li>
<li>Identify attributes of macroalgal fields favoured by juvenile fish and examine the relative importance of predation and habitat quality on juvenile abundance.</li>
<li>Assess influence of juvenile fish on future adult abundance.</li>
</ol>","<p>The project will improve our understanding of the spatial arrangement of macroalgal fields, thereby increasing our ability to predict distribution of algal biomass and diversity for spatial planning. Similarly, objective 2 of the project will assess how abundance and biodiversity of fish recruits relate to characteristics of macroalgal fields improving our understanding of which habitat features promote recruitment. As such this project directly addresses DEC Science Division Strategic Plan for Biodiversity Conservation Research 2008-2017, Strategic Goal G1 to 'understand the composition of, and patterning in, terrestrial and marine biodiversity' and related strategies that seek to enhance our understanding of processes structuring assemblages of key biological assets within WA Marine Parks. More specifically, the management plan for the Ningaloo Marine Park identifies marcrolagae and finfish as an ecological asset that require research to better characterise their diversity, distribution and abundance within the reserves.</p>
<p>The third objective of the project will improve our ability to predict future abundance of adult stock from recruit abundance. Such information will contribute to our understanding of species sustainability, particularly those threatened by changes in habitat, climate and fishing pressure. Findings from the project will specifically address strategies within the management plan for the Ningaloo Marine Park to develop management targets for commercially and recreationally targeted finfish species.</p>","<p>The Department of Environment and Conservation will be the primary user of the knowledge gained from this project. Research findings from the project will be integrated into management frameworks, monitoring programs (WAMMP) and contribute to management responses such as future research. Knowledge gained from the project will be transferred directly to relevant DEC Pilbara Region and Exmouth District staff in the form of data, technical reports and presentations. Moreover inclusion of regional staff in field work and reports will facilitate knowledge transfer. Research findings will be published in peer reviewed journals so that it is available to researchers and managers nationally and internationally. Findings from the project will be communicated to the general public in the form of newsletters, local media releases and public lectures. Findings will also form the basis of an Australian Research Council (ARC) grant application.</p>","<p><strong>Milestone </strong></p>

Preliminary studies have quantified seasonal changes in biomass and composition of algal communities at two locations in the Ningaloo lagoon. This study found that sites within locations, separated by 100s of meters, had very different algal biomass and composition, but algal samples collected from 6 replicate plots within each site were very similar (Fulton et al. In prep). We intend to expand this study to examine 20-30 macroalgal sites and map spatial variation in macroalgal abundance and diversity along the length of Ningaloo. At each site GPS will be used to record details on the location which will later be used to measure macroalgal site position relative to shore, backreef and channels. Within each site six 10m line intercept transects we will be used to assess % cover of algae and community composition. In addition, we will record the length of algal fronds every 2m to assess canopy height and biomass. Abundance of herbivorous fish at each site will be quantified by underwater visual census (UVC) and loggers located at each macroalgal site will be used to assess water temperature. All sites will be surveyed during February, when algal biomass is close to its annual peak. Potential drivers of spatial variation in attributes of the algal community (e.g. % cover, biomass, diversity) will be examined with best sub-sets analysis combined with Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Potential explanatory variables in the analysis will be meadow position, temperature, depth and abundance of herbivorous fish.</p>
<p>Identify attributes of algal fields favoured by juvenile fish. At each macroalgal site juvenile fish will be identified and counted on nine 30x1m transects following the technique described by Depczynski et al. (2011). In addition, UVC will provide an indication of predator size and abundance over each transect. The relationship between juvenile fish abundance, macroalgal attributes and predators will be examined using best sub-sets analysis combined with AIC. Attributes of macroalgal meadows described in objective 1 and abundance of potential predators will be entered as explanatory variables, whilst diversity and abundance of juvenile fish will be entered as dependent variables.</p>
<p>Assess influence of juvenile fish on adult abundance. Abundance of juvenile and adult fish will be recorded annually, using the methods described above, from 2013-2015. In addition, UVC will be carried out on back reef areas to provide a more comprehensive assessment of adult fish abundance and assess the possibility that some juveniles migrate from macroalgal meadows to reefs areas. The focus of the study will be on species from the family Lethrinidae, which are the main target of recreational fishers at Ningaloo (Sumner et al. 2002), however relations between juvenile and adult abundance of other species will also be investigated. The legal size of the two most common lethrinids Spangled emperor, (_Lethrinus nebulosus, _410 mm) and the yellow tail emperor (_Lethrinus atkonsoni _280 mm) is not reached till fish are 4-5 years years old (Ebisawa &amp; Takakazu 2009; Marriott et al 2011). Hence at least 4-5 years of continuous data are required to assess the link between juveniles and fish susceptible to fishing. For this reason, data collected during the project will be combined with information on the abundance of juveniles, collected annually since 2009. Size estimates of adult fish in the field will be used to assess how annual recruitment has influenced the size distribution of fish. Because mortality is likely to be high during the first year of a fishes life we will carry out surveys for fish at each location during the winter (August). Analyses will examine the strength of correlations between recruits and year size classes, using sites as replicates.</p>",granted,False,<p>None</p>,not required,False,not required,"<p>Raw data, including data sheets and digital imagery will be archived in the DEC corporate records system, recorded in a data report and stored on a database housed on the DEC Science Division server (T drive).</p>

1775,<p>SP 2014-003 Cat eradication on Dirk Hartog Island (D Algar <em>et al</em>)</p>,"<p>The Australian vertebrate fauna, particularly mammals, has undergone a significant decline since European settlement. Over the last 200 years, 29 mammal species have become extinct, and another 89 taxa are threatened with extinction (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014). Many of these declines and extinctions have occurred in the semi-arid and arid areas of Australia (Burbidge and McKenzie 1989, Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 2008). Offshore islands have provided refuge for several mammal species that otherwise have declined or become extinct on the Australian mainland (Abbott and Burbidge 1995).</p>
<p>Dirk Hartog Island (DHI) is WA&rsquo;s largest island (58,640 ha) and lies within the Shark Bay World Heritage Area. In 1616 the Dutch navigator Dirk Hartog landed at the northen end of DHI and became the first European to land on the west coast of Australia. From 1860 - 2009 it was a pastoral lease supporting up to 20,000 sheep (<em>Ovis aries</em>) at a time. Goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) were introduced to the island in the early 1900s following the construction and operation of a lighthouse at Cape Inscription, and they became feral soon after. Cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are believed to have been introduced to DHI several times over the last 150 years and are now feral (Koch <em>et al.</em> 2015). House mice (<em>Mus</em> <em>domesticus</em>) have also become feral on the island, and horses (<em>Equus caballus</em>) and camels (<em>Camelus dromedarius</em>) were present on DHI as part of the pastoral operations (Burbidge and George 1978).</p>
<p>Thirteen species of native terrestrial mammal are known to have occurred on DHI (Baynes 1990, McKenzie <em>et al</em>. 2000), however all but three, smaller species have become extinct over the last few hundred years. This project proposes to reconstruct the island&rsquo;s fauna assemblage by reintroducing 10 species of native mammal and one species of bird, and introducing two other threatened mammal species for conservation reasons, over a 12 year period. Eight&nbsp;of the species that are proposed for translocation to DHI are listed as threatened under the WA <em>Wildlife Conservation Act</em> <em>1950</em> and Commonwealth&rsquo;s <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act</em> <em>1999</em>, and another two species are Conservation Dependent. Many of these species are now restricted to a few offshore islands, or fenced conservation enclosures.</p>
<p>The value of DHI to mammal conservation has been recognised for several decades. In 1975 the Conservation Through Reserves Committee (CTRC 1975) recommended that DHI be included in the conservation estate, but this was not achieved until 2009 when most of DHI became a National Park. In 1995, the pastoral lessee developed an environmental management plan that proposed the eradication of sheep, feral goats and feral cats, and the reintroduction of the native mammals that once occurred on DHI (Saunders 1995). Prior to this, in 1974-78 an attempt was made to establish a population of banded hare-wallabies (<em>Lagostrophus fasciatus</em>) on DHI (Prince 1979), but this failed due to drought, overgrazing by sheep and goats and an inability to effectively control feral cats (Short <em>et al.</em> 1992). In 2003, the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) supported the use of Net Conservation Benefits (NCB) funds derived from the Gorgon Gas Development on Barrow Island to be used for the restoration of DHI and reconstruction of its mammal fauna. DHI is also within the Shark Bay World Heritage Property. One of the four criteria for which the Shark Bay area was listed as a World Heritage site was that the area supported important and significant natural habitats where threatened species of animals of outstanding universal value still survive. Reconstructing DHI&rsquo;s mammal fauna will further enhance the values of the World Heritage Property in respect of threatened fauna conservation.</p>
<p>NCB funding has allowed realisation of the vision of restoring DHI to a similar ecological condition to that which existed when Dirk Hartog landed on the island in October 1616. A proposal for the DHI National Park Ecological Restoration Project (DHINPERP) was submitted by the then Department of Environment and Conservation (now Parks and Wildlife) to the NCB Board in 2011 and proposed a two stage process for achieving this (DEC 2011). Stage One (2011-2018) has focussed on the eradication of sheep, feral goats and feral cats, the management of weeds, and implementing a biosecurity program for the island. This was to be followed by Stage Two (2018-2030) that would restore the native mammal species to the island. The DHINPERP was funded by the NCB in 2012 and work on Stage One commenced immediately. With the successful implementation of Stage One, planning is now underway for Stage Two to commence. This project will contribute significantly to the long-term conservation of several threatened species. In addition, by returning the mammal species that were once known on DHI, the ecosystem services provided by their digging, burrowing, grazing and browsing activities will assist in re-establishing the ecological processes to support plant communities. It will be the largest ecological restoration project undertaken in Australia, and possibly the world.</p>
<p>Stage One of the DHINPERP has progressed well and since 2010 over 7,000 sheep and feral goats have been removed from the island. As at June 2017, two radio-collared &lsquo;Judas&rsquo; goats remained and these will be removed by November 2017. The island was split into two management areas by a cat-proof fence to facilitate effective cat eradication. Following baiting and trapping programs since 2014, good progress has been made with removing feral cats and eradication will be confirmed by September 2018. No black rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) have been detected, either on DHI, or in the broader Shark Bay area (Palmer 2017). Weed management is ongoing. Vegetation assessment by Landsat imagery has shown that there has been a 35% increase in vegetation cover, predominantly in the south part of DHI, since sheep and goat removal began (van Dongen and Huntley 2016).</p>
<p>In anticipation of Stage Two of the DHINPERP proceeding, a strategic framework to guide the fauna reconstruction and conservation program on DHI 2017 - 2030 was prepared (Morris <em>et al.</em> 2017). This Project Plan provides details about planning and implementing the translocation program, the research required to support the translocation program, and the research that could be undertaken once fauna populations have been established on DHI.</p>
<p>It is proposed to undertake a trial release of 10-12 banded hare-wallabies and 10-12 rufous hare-wallabies (<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>) in August / September 2017 to trial collection and transport techniques, and develop adequate monitoring protocols for use on DHI. Providing this trial is successful, 40-50 of each species will be translocated in September/October 2018 and 2019. Providing this translocation is successful, the translocation program for the other 10 mammals species and one bird species, as outlined in the Milestones and Tasks below, will be implemented over a 12 year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The aim of Stage Two of the DHINPERP is to re-establish up to 10 terrestrial native mammal species and one bird species on Dirk Hartog Island and establish up to two native mammal species that may have previously occurred there, along with healthy vegetation and ecosystem processes to sustain the islands biodiversity (Parks and Wildlife 2017).</p>
<p>Specifically this project aims to:</p>
<p>a) Identify the most suitable source populations to act as founders for new populations on DHI, using the criteria set out in the Strategic Framework (Morris <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>
<p>b) Establish new populations of 12 mammal species and one birds species on DHI, using the species selection criteria set out in the Strategic Framework (Morris <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>
<p>c) Confirm that the translocations are successful and that all new populations on DHI are healthy and self-sustaining, using criteria set out in the Strategic Framework (Morris <em>et al.</em> 2017) and approved Translocation Proposals.</p>
<p>d) Promote scientific research associated with the translocations, monitoring and establishment of fauna, and publish scientific findings.</p>","<p>This project will achieve one of the key outcomes identified in the Wildlife strategic priorities in the Parks and Wildlife Strategic Directions document 2014-2017 - ""With external partnerships, restore the original suite of native fauna to Dirk Hartog Island National Park"".</p>
<p>Specifically, if successful, this project will significantly increase distributions and populations sizes of eight species of threatened mammal (rufous hare-wallaby, <em>Lagorchestes hirsutus; </em>banded hare-wallaby, <em>Lagostrophus fasciatus</em>; woylie, <em>Bettongia penicillata</em>; dibbler, <em>Parantechinus apicalis; </em>chuditch,<em> Dasyurus geoffroii</em>; western barred bandicoot, <em>Perameles bougainville</em>; heath mouse, <em>Pseudomys shortridgei</em>; and Shark Bay mouse, <em>Pseudomys fieldi</em>), two Conservation Dependent species (boodie, <em>Bettongia lesueur</em>; and greater stick-nest rat, <em>Leporillus conditor</em>), and a Priority species (mulgara, <em>Dasycercus</em> <em>blythi</em>). This will potentially lead to an improvement in conservation status for all of these species. The only island population of the desert mouse (<em>Pseudomys desertor</em>) will be established, and the return of the only bird species known to have become extinct on DHI, the western grasswren (<em>Amytornis textilis textilis</em>) will also be accomplished.</p>
<p>The re-establishment of medium-sized native mammals will also allow many of the ecological services that these diggers and burrowers provided, to&nbsp;be returned to the DHI ecosystem. In addition, opportunities for research at all stages of the translocation program will be provided resulting in a better understanding of fauna translocation processes and the values of fauna on ecosystem management.&nbsp;</p>","<p>This will be the largest island fauna restoration project in Australia and possibly the world, and there will be global interest in the outcomes and the techniques used. Knowledge and technology transfer to other organisations contemplating fauna translocations to islands will be through reports, publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts and presentations at conferences. Communication of results to the Shark Bay community will be undertaken via the DHINPERP Community Engagement Strategy. Media statements will be issued via PICA to highlight significant events in the projects implementation.</p>","<p><strong>2017 - Trial translocation of banded hare-wallabies and rufous hare-wallabies:</strong></p>

<p>DHI is WA's largest island with an area of 58,640 ha (Abbott and Burbidge 1995). It lies at approximately 25&deg;50'S 113&deg;0.5'E (centroid) at the western edge of the Shark Bay World Heritage Area. The island is approximately 79km long and has a maximum width of 11km with its long axis in a south-east to north-west direction.</p>
<p>DHI is classified as a 'Coastal Dune' geomorphic district (Payne <em>et al</em>. 1987) and consists of coastal dunes and undulating plains of shallow calcareous sand over limestone or calcrete. Five land systems occur on the island, three of which (Coast, Edel and Inscription collectively form 99% of the island; Payne <em>et al</em>. 1987) and are described below:</p>
<p>Coast: occurs along the entire western side of the island and consists of large long-walled parabolic dunes and narrow swales, unstable blow-out areas and bare mobile dunes, minor limestone hills and rises and steep sea cliffs (41.9%);</p>
<p>Edel: occurs in eastern and south-eastern parts of the island and consists of undulating sandy plains with minor low dunes, limestone rises and saline flats (32.5%);</p>
<p>Inscription: is found in the north-east and central-east of the island. It consists of gently undulating sandy plains over limestone (24.3%);</p>
<p>The two remaining land systems are Birrida (0.7%) and Littoral (0.6%).</p>
<p>Vegetation on the island is generally sparse, low and open and comprises spinifex (<em>Triodia</em>) hummock grassland with an overstorey of <em>Acacia coriacea</em>, <em>Pittosporum phylliraeoides</em> over <em>Acacia ligulata</em>, <em>Diplolaena dampieri</em>, <em>Exocarpus sparteus</em> shrubs over <em>Triodia</em> sp., <em>Acanthocarpus preissii</em> and <em>Atriplex bunburyana</em> hummock grasses, chenopods or shrubs (Beard 1976). Adjacent to the exposed western coastline is a mixed open chenopod shrubland of <em>Atriplex</em> sp., <em>Olearia axillaris</em> and <em>Frankenia</em> sp. and slightly inland in more protected sites, <em>Triodia plurinervata</em>, <em>Triodia</em> sp., <em>Melaleuca huegelii</em>, <em>Thryptomene baeckeacea</em> and <em>Atriplex</em> sp.. There are patches of bare sand and several birridas (salt pans). On the east coast there are patches of mixed open heath of <em>Diplolaena dampieri</em>, <em>Myoporum</em> sp. and <em>Conostylis</em> sp. shrubs (Beard 1976). The overall height of the vegetation reduces towards the north of the island.</p>
<p>The climate of the region is 'semi-desert Mediterranean' (Beard 1976; Payne <em>et al</em>. 1987). The mean annual rainfall for Denham (recording station 006044, located 37km to the east of DHI) is 224mm (Bureau of Meteorology 2013; long-term records 1893-2013). The wettest month is June with an average of 55mm. February is the hottest month with a mean daily maximum of 31.8&deg;C while July is the coolest month with a mean daily maximum of 21.7&deg;C. Prevailing winds are southerly in the morning swinging to the south-west in the afternoon with the sea breeze (Bureau of Meteorology 2013).</p>
<p>Between the 1860s and 2009, DHI was managed as a pastoral lease and grazed by sheep (<em>Ovis aries</em>) and goats (<em>Capra</em> <em>hircus</em>). More recently, tourism has been the main commercial activity on the island. Cats were probably introduced by early pastoralists and became feral during the late 19th century (Burbidge 2001). Most of the island became a National Park in November 2009, and this provided the opportunity to reconstruct the native mammal fauna as had been proposed earlier (Saunders 1995). DHI could potentially support one of the most diverse mammal assemblages in Australia and contribute significantly to the long-term conservation of several threatened species.</p>
<p><strong>2. Translocation Proposals</strong></p>
<p>The fauna translocations proposed for DHI will comply with the relevant Parks and Wildlife Corporate Policy and Guidelines (Parks and Wildlife 2015 a, b), and the <em>Animal Welfare Act 2002</em>. &nbsp;A Translocation Proposal (TP) will be prepared for each of the 13 species to be translocated to DHI. These will contain background biological and ecological information of the species being translocated, what source populations will be used and why, and how the founders will be captured and transported to DHI. Short, medium and long-term criteria for translocation success or failure will be established, and monitoring implemented to allow these to be assessed.</p>
<p>Founders will be released at pre-determined sites at dusk, usually within 24 hours of being captured. Methodologies for monitoring short - medium term survivorship (fate over time) for most mammal species will involve the use of either VHF or GPS telemetry attachments (collars or tail mounted transmitters). Longer term monitoring of survivorship will use trapping, camera traps and spotlighting techniques. Monitoring of the the translocated western grasswren will be through the use of coloured leg bands and field observations. Animal Ethics approvals will be obtained before translocations commence.</p>
<p><strong>3. Genetic audit</strong></p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Sampling and DNA extraction</strong></p>
<p>Genetic samples will be taken from animals during each phase of the fauna reconstruction process, i.e. the initial audit of potential source populations, founder populations released onto DHI, and new recruits as part of the regular post-release monitoring.</p>
<p>Ear biopsy samples will be obtained from mammals&nbsp;using a sterilised 1-2mm ear notching tool following standard operating procedures (Department of Parks and Wildlife, 2015). Tissue samples will be stored in 80-100% analytical grade ethanol under cool conditions before transport to the lab.&nbsp; Genomic DNA will be extracted from tissue samples using a standard &lsquo;salting out&rsquo; protocol (Sunnucks and Hales, 1996) and stored at -20C until use. Where biopsy samples cannot be obtained, scats may be used as an alternative DNA source, though these can be less reliable than tissue. Scat DNA will be extracted using the Qiagen DNA Stool Mini-Kit following the manufacturer&rsquo;s protocol and stored at -20C until use.</p>
<p>For birds, blood or feather samples will be obtained and DNA extracted using the 'salting out' protocol (feathers) or Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (blood).</p>
<p><strong>b) Genotyping</strong></p>
<p>Different methods will be used to obtain genetic data from sampled animals dependent on (i) the choice of the most appropriate genetic marker type to address the research question, and (ii) the availability and need to integrate with existing data.</p>
<p><em>Microsatellites</em>: For several species, microsatellite marker data are&nbsp;available from previously published studies. In cases where it is most efficient and informative to complement existing data to answer specific research questions we will utilise these existing markers. Microsatellite primers will be obtained from published studies and PCR amplified using the Qiagen Multiplex PCR kit following manufacturer&rsquo;s protocols. Microsatellite genotype profiles will be obtained through fragment analysis at the State Agricultural Biotechnology Centre (SABC) at Murdoch University.</p>
<p><em>RADsequencing</em>: New genomic techniques such as RADseq offer a means of generating large numbers of informative markers relatively rapidly and cheaply, increasing the power of genetic analyses. RADseq will be used to provide genetic assessment of source populations and for genetic monitoring post-translocation. It is anticipated that RADseq data will be generated using a commercial service, Diversity Array Technologies (DART).</p>
<p><em>Exon capture</em>: An alternative genomic approach, exon capture, may be employed when appropriate to address taxonomic questions (e.g. distinguishing sub-species of &nbsp;mala&nbsp;<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>). Exon captures and sequencing will be performed at ANU as part of the Oz Mammal Genomics initiative.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Data analysis</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Genetic assessment of source populations</em></p>
<p>To assess the genetic &lsquo;health&rsquo; of source populations we will estimate genetic diversity using several metrics, (e.g. observed and expected heterozygosity, allelic richness), the level of observed inbreeding (F<sub>IS</sub>) and the degree of relatedness (<em>r</em>). Genetic differentiation amongst source populations will be assessed by several metrics including the use of clustering approaches (e.g. STRUCTURE, PCA) and estimation of the fixation index, F<sub>ST</sub>.</p>
<p>Where practical we will aim to source animals from populations with high genetic diversity, low inbreeding and to source animals from multiple populations to maximise genetic diversity represented in the translocated population on DHI. Mixing of divergent populations will be assessed against the framework proposed in Frankham <em>et al</em>. (2011) to minimise risks of outbreeding depression. Population viability analysis using VORTEX software (Lacy and Pollack, 2014) and incorporating both genetic and demographic data will be used to inform translocations by estimating numbers of individuals required to maximise genetic diversity and genetic representativeness and assess mixing ratios where multiple source populations are used.</p>
<p><em>Genetic monitoring of translocated populations</em></p>
<p>We will assess the genetic 'health' of translocated populations on DHI at regular intervals, with tissue collection occurring during annual monitoring. It is anticipated that genetic analyses will be conducted at two year intervals for species with high breeding capacities, and three year intervals for species with a lower breeding capacity (see Table 1). At each interval we will estimate the population genetic diversity (observed and expected heterozygosity, allelic richness) and inbreeding/relatedness, and assess changes in these metrics over time. We will aim to sustain genetic diversity levels over the longer time frame at 95% that of the starting population; supplementations (genetic augmentation) may be recommended in order to maintain population genetic diversity and minimise inbreeding. Population viability models will be updated with genetic and demographic monitoring data to inform ongoing management activities, for example, the number and timing of supplementations (if required).</p>

<p><strong>4. Monitoring source populations</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>a) Spotlight transects for mammals</strong></p>
<p><em>Bernier and Dorre Islands</em></p>
<p>Bernier and Dorre Islands were divided into blocks of two or four transect lines, based on Short <em>et al.</em> (1989) and / or placed in proximity to safe landing points. Five blocks of four transects were established, 500m apart (total of 20 transects) running in an east-west direction and were marked for spotlighting on each island from 2006 to 2010.&nbsp; Transects were marked with a 1.8 m jarrah stake driven into the ground and marked at the top with reflective tape, with the start or finish of the transect set above high water mark or at a cliff-top. &nbsp;This was supplemented by reflective tape being placed on high vegetation such as <em>Acacia</em> spp.&nbsp; The spacing between the markers was variable but generally a few hundred metres and where possible placed on high points, but varied depending on terrain and vegetation.&nbsp; From 2011 to 2013 transect locations, number of transects (an additional seven transects were added) and survey frequencies were modified to meet Distance analysis requirements.&nbsp; The average transect length on Bernier Island is 4.8 km and on Dorre Island 5.4 km. Their locations have been mapped, and GPS coordinates recorded.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2013, the transects were walked by a team of two people at no faster that 3km/hr or less.&nbsp; One team member would use a 30w LightForce SL170 Striker spotlight to spot for animals and navigate by spotting the reflective tape on the markers.&nbsp; The spotter needed to maintain a line as close as possible to the transect line by navigating between the reflective markers.&nbsp; The other team member would walk behind the spotter and when an animal was sighted would take a GPS waypoint on the line where the spotter is, then go to where the animal was first sighted and either take another GPS waypoint or pace the perpendicular distance back to the transect line.&nbsp; The distance from the transect line would be calculated by either converting the recorders pacing distance to meters or subtracting the Northing of the animal location from Northing of the transect line.</p>
<p>From 2016 onwards, each team of two were&nbsp;equipped with a Trimble Juno J41 Series 5 hand held computer, TruPulse 360˚B laser range finder (<a href=""http://www.technologyonecorp.com/"">www.TechnologyOneCorp.com</a>) and a Lightforce Striker 170 35w HID spotlight fitted with a Lithium Ferrous P04 9amp hour battery (<a href=""http://www.lightforce.com"">www.lightforce.com</a>).&nbsp; The Juno J41 Series 5 runs Trimble Terrasync (<a href=""http://www.Trimble.com"">www.Trimble.com</a>) mapping and GIS software and has all the required spotlighting transects for each island installed as shapefiles, as well as any other required or relevant GIS mapping information, i.e. landing points, island boundary shape files etc. The range finder connects wirelessly via Bluetooth to the Juno J41 Series 5 computer.</p>
<p>Teams walk at no more than 3km/hour.&nbsp; The team member operating the spotlight and rangefinder pinpoints the animal&rsquo;s location with the range finder.&nbsp; Navigation and data recording are&nbsp;undertaken by the other team member using the Juno computer, and the transect line is maintained by following the transect shapefile on the hand-held computer.&nbsp; When an animal is sighted the data recorder records the species, number sighted and location of the team.&nbsp; The spotter pinpoints the animal&rsquo;s location using the rangefinder, the location of the animal is then automatically transmitted to the hand held computer.</p>
<p><em>Trimouille Island</em></p>
<p>Mala on Trimouille Island are monitored using Distance sampling as per the 2016 methodology for hare-wallabies on Bernier and Dorre Island above.&nbsp; Trimouille Island has 10 transects running east west, and are 500m apart, covering the full length of the island. These have been mapped and their GPS coordinates recorded.</p>
<p><strong>b) Trapping for mammals: Cage and Elliott traps</strong></p>
<p><em>Bernier and Dorre Islands</em></p>
<p>Additional monitoring on Bernier and Dorre Islands using cage and Elliott trap grids is undertaken to target western barred bandicoots as they are likely not adequately monitored and/or potentially underestimated by Distance analysis alone due to their more cryptic nature and small size.&nbsp; Opportunistically, boodies are capture during these trapping sessions and are concurrently monitored in the process.&nbsp; Shark Bay mice are monitored on Bernier Island using Elliott traps alone as spotlighting does not adequately census this small species.</p>
<p>At White Beach (Dorre Island) a 7 x 7 trap grid with traps at 40m spacings has been established to the east of the dunes, covering a mixed habitat of travertine, <em>Scaevola</em> spp. and <em>Triodia</em> sp. vegetation.&nbsp; At each trap site, an Elliott and cage trap is set, baited with a mixture made up of rolled oats and peanut butter.&nbsp; Sardines are not used to reduce the likelihood of the traps being inundated by meat ants (<em>Iridomyrmex</em>&nbsp;sp.) which can be prolific in some areas of the islands and pose a risk to entrapped animals.</p>
<p>Two grids have been established on Bernier Island at Red Cliff Bay.&nbsp; One 7 x 7 grid (as above) has been established in suitable habitat, predominately of <em>Triodia</em> sp., <em>Scaevola </em>sp. and some fringing <em>Spinifex</em> sp. just west of the dunes, approximately 500m east of Red Cliff.&nbsp; A 7 x 3 grid to monitor Shark Bay mice has been established in suitable habitat (predominately <em>Spinifex </em>sp.) in consolidated dunes approximately 300m west south west of Red Cliff (Figure 4).&nbsp; Each trap site has an Elliott trap baited the standard bait (as above).</p>
<p>The locations of all the grids and traps on Bernier and Dorre Islands have been mapped and their coordinates recorded.</p>
<p>Standard morphometric measurements (pes length, head length, and scrotal width), weight and reproductive status of females recorded, and tissue samples for DNA analysis taken for each captured animal. Boodies are western barred bandicoots are permanently marked with Allfex Passive Integrated Implants (<a href=""http://www.allflex.com.au"">www.allflex.com.au</a>), any captured rodents are marked using the standard ear clipping numbering system.</p>
<p><em>North West Island</em></p>
<p>A trapping grid has been established in <em>Spinifex longifolius</em> consolidated coastal habitat on North West Island, Montebello group, to monitor Shark Bay mice. &nbsp;The trapping grid is same layout as on Bernier Island so that capture rates can be compared. &nbsp;The grid location has been mapped and GPS coordinates recorded. Morphometric measurement, marking and tissue sampling are as above.</p>
<p><strong>c) Hand netting of mammals</strong></p>
<p>Morphometric and tissue samples are obtained from the two hare-wallaby species by hand-netting at night.&nbsp; A team of six people are required, made up of four runners/netters, one spotlighter and one equipment carrier.&nbsp; Two runners walk approximately 10m abreast both side of the spotter with the equipment carrier following up close behind.&nbsp; When an animal is sighted the spotlighter maintains the light on it while the runners move up slowly encircling the animal, generally the animal remains still and is easily netted.&nbsp; Animals that do move away can be chased down however, pursuits are restricted to no more than 100m to reduce stress to the animals and the possibility of females ejecting pouch young.</p>
<p><strong>d) Mist-netting birds and field observations</strong></p>
<p>It is anticipated that the founder western grasswrens will be sourced from the nearby Shark Bay mainland, possibly Peron Peninsula. A survey for potential source sites will be undertaken using experience ornithologists, and two - three source sites will be selected 12 months before grasswren translocations are planned. The grasswren populations at these sites will then be monitored to obtain estimates of abundance. Mist nets will be used to capture a sample of the population, and captured birds will be weighed, sexed where possible, measured and marked with coloured leg bands. &nbsp;Swabs and blood samples for health screening and genetic analysis may be taken.</p>
<p><strong>e) Data Analysis</strong></p>
<p><em>Distance (Spotlighting)</em></p>
<p>Transect parameters and fauna observations are&nbsp;modelled using Distance 6.2 software (Thomas<em> et al.</em> 2010), to account for diminishing probability of detection with increasing distance from the transect line. The design of the analysis was a line transect 80m wide (40m each side of the transect), single observer and single observations of fauna at distances perpendicular to the transect. Conventional distance sampling was used to model the probability of detection as a function of the distance from the transect line via size bias regression and bootstrapped variance (Buckland<em> et al.</em> 1993; Buckland<em> et al.</em> 2001).</p>
<p>Akaike's Information Criterion was used to select the &lsquo;best&rsquo; fitting models from amongst the following: uniform cosine, uniform simple polynomial, half-normal cosine, hazard rate cosine and hazard rate simple polynomial (see Buckland<em> et al.</em> 1993; Buckland<em> et al.</em> 2001 for more information). The best fitting models were used to estimate population sizes for the areas surveyed and these were extrapolated to estimate total population sizes for each Island. The data were log transformed to ensure they met the assumptions of the tests and <em>t</em>-tests were used to compare population sizes between islands.</p>
<p><em>Cage and Elliott Trapping</em></p>
<p>Spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) analysis of the cage and Elliott capture data is undertaken using Program Density 5.03 (<a href=""http://www.otago.ac.nz/density"">http://www.otago.ac.nz/density</a>).&nbsp; Estimates of &nbsp;population densities of western barred bandicoots, boodies and Shark Bay mice can also be derived using inverse prediction and/or maximum likelihood models to fit the data.</p>
<p><strong>5. Translocation Protocols</strong></p>
<p><em>Animal capture</em></p>
<p>Founder mammals from source populations will be captured using the trapping and / or hand netting methods described above. Once captured the mammals will be marked, weighed, measured, and placed in black cloth bags and tagged with species and capture location. Data will be recorded either on standardised data sheets or into a hand held computer.</p>
<p>Founder grasswrens will be mist netted at the source sites. The nets will be erected at dawn, then checked and cleared before the heat of mid-morning. Nets will be dismantled or furled when not being attended. Captured birds will be weighed, measured, sexed where possible, fitted with coloured leg bands, and placed in calico bags in small, well-ventilated boxes.</p>
<p><em>Transport</em></p>
<p>Method of transport will be dependent on species being translocated at the time.&nbsp; Larger species will be individually bagged and placed in airline-approved pet carriers (K9 Pet Carrier 53 x 37 x 37 cm PP20). &nbsp;Bags will be secured within the pet carriers to the corners to prevent animals rolling on each other during transit.&nbsp; Due to their relative sizes, two hare- wallabies will be placed in each pet carrier, boodies and bandicoots can be transported in groups of up to four.&nbsp; Smaller species (smaller than western barred bandicoots) will be transported within Elliott traps placed within pet carriers.&nbsp; Depending on sea conditions, animals may need to be taken off the islands in water tight containers but should only be secured in these for the duration from transferring them from shore and to the charter vessel. Founder mammals&nbsp;will be transported to DHI either onboard a sea-going charter vessel, or an aircraft (fixed-wing or helicopter), or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Founder birds will be transported to release site(s) on DHI by either air-conditioned vehicles, or aircraft, or a combination of both. Birds will be released in the mid afternoon, within 6-8 hours of capture.</p>
<p><em>Stress and sedation: Rufous hare-wallaby / mala</em></p>
<p>Rufous hare-wallabies/mala are prone to capture myopathy, causing death, and there is anecdotal information than the Shark Bay sub-species may be more prone to capture induced stress than mala found on Trimouille Island (C. Simms, pers comm.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is recommended to inject rufous-hare-wallabies / mala (particularly Shark bay RHW) with Vitamin E to reduce the likelihood of capture myopathy. &nbsp;If it is used, Vitamin E injections should be given on initial capture to prevent possible capture myopathy from subsequent stress events such as transport. SelVit E (Ilium Selvite E, Troy, Australia) has been used in the past, administered intramuscular (IM) at a rate of 0.2ml/kg.&nbsp; However, this product is no longer sold in Australia.&nbsp; An alternative injectable prophylactic Vit E will need to be used.</p>
<p>To reduce the impact of additional stressors such as transport it may be necessary to sedate the animals. Veterinarian advice recommends the use of neuroleptic agents to induce a calm and tranquil state, and reduce stress. The following procedure is recommended to sedate the animals for transport:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial use (as soon as possible after capture) of Diazepam at a lower dose rate (1mg/kg IM). Diazepam (Troy, Australia) will only provide sedation for up to a few hours (at most) and suggest combining it with a short-acting neuroleptic agent, Azaperone.&nbsp;</li>
<li>An hour (approx.) after the Diazepam has been administered &ndash; administer the neuroleptic Azaperone (Stresnil&reg;, Ausrichter, Australia) at a rate of 2 mg/kg IM which has a sedation duration of 3-8 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neuroleptic agents are less effective if the animal is already stressed when injected and less effective in creating a tranquil state. Therefore, it is important to give the Diazepam first (which is not affected in the same manner by the animal&rsquo;s state).</p>
<p>A decision on whether to use Vitamin e to reduce capture myopathy and / or neuroleptic agents to reduce stress will be made after further discussions with veterinarians and others who have translocated rufous hare-wallabies / male previously.</p>
<p><strong>6. Release site selection</strong></p>
<p>The release sites for the species to be translocated to DHI will be selected based on knowledge of their habitat and dietary preferences recorded in the published and unpublished literature. Release sites will also be selected using physical features (e.g. cat barrier fence, large, unvegetated sand dunes) to restrict wide-ranging movements in the early stages of translocations. Recorded interactions between translocated species (e.g. boodies and woylies) will also be taken into account when release sites are selected. The details of release sites and the reasons they were selected will be provided in the Translocation Proposals being prepared for each species.</p>
<p>The adequate availability and abundance of suitable invertebrate prey items is important for the success of dibbler translocations. A survey of prey items on DHI will be undertaken prior to dibbler releases in 2018 and 2019. This will involve the systematic sampling of litter&nbsp;for invertebrates &gt; 3mm during periods of moist soil conditions (so the invertebrates are active). Litter samples will be collected, labelled&nbsp;and stored in plastic bags and the invertebrate fauna extracted using heat lamps. The location and vegetation association of each collection site will be recorded.&nbsp;Survey sites will be in the vicinity of the vehicle&nbsp;tracks on DHI, which offer transects in&nbsp;north-south and east-west directions.</p>
<p><strong>7. Determining the success of translocations on DHI</strong></p>
<p>The success of translocations will be assessed against&nbsp;short, medium and long term criteria which will be detailed in the Translocation Proposals for each species. These criteria will be based on survivorship, reproduction and recruitment, and occupancy and distribution. Monitoring using several techniques will be implemented to provide the information required to determine success / failure.</p>
<p><strong>a) Radio Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Short term monitoring of survivorship and habitat use will be undertaken using radio-telemetry. Before release on DHI, a proportion of founder mammals (up to 50%) will be fitted with either VHF mortality sensing radio-collars, or GPS radio-collars. As part of the pilot translocation of banded and rufous hare-wallabies in 2017, all of the founder hare-wallabies will be fitted with either a VHF Ultimate mortality sensing radio collars (Sirtrack, New Zealand) to provide information on survivorship, movements and refuge selection; or a FLR V GPS collar (Telemetry Solution, USA) to obtain finer scale movement information.&nbsp; All collars will have a degradable elastic insert to ensure collars breakaway over time.</p>
<p>Novel techniques using unmanned aeronautical vehicles (UAVs), or drones, as aerial platforms for radiotelemetry are currently being developed and there will be opportunities to use the DHI fauna translocations to develop these in collaboration with third parties.</p>
<p>Released mammals will be monitored intensively for the first 10-12&nbsp;weeks post-release, then less frequently, depending on the outcomes of the intensive monitoring. It is anticipated that radio-collars will breakaway, or be removed after trapping the animals by six months post-release. GPS locations can be down loaded remotely from the FLR V collars as required.</p>
<p><strong>b) Camera Traps</strong></p>
<p>Once founder populations have established, medium to longer-term monitoring of relative abundance and habitat use will be achieved using camera traps, either in linear transects, or in grids.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>c) Trapping</strong></p>
<p>Longer term monitoring of population trends, demograhics and reproductive biology will be undertaken using trapping grids and transects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Data analysis</strong></p>
<p>Morphometric measurements, age, sex and bodyweight data taken for all animals&nbsp;captured and translocated will be stored on an MS Access database. A body condition index will be derived for each mammal individual using a relationship between body weight and a measure of size such as pes or head length. Capture data from monitoring sites will be analysed to detect population trends using Program MARK and used to assist population viability analyses using VORTEX software. Population estimates at potential source sites will be undertaken using Program DISTANCE where spotlighting transects are used and SECR where trapping is used. Estimates of population size and condition of translocated populations will be compared annually and reported.</p>
<p>Survivorship of translocated fauna will be determined using the Kaplan-Meier estimate based on knowledge of numbers of founders released alive and the number who subsequently die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>9. Other research</strong></p>
<p>This project offers many research opportunities to improve conservation management of threatened species, and for assessing the impact of the removal of pest animal species, and the impact of re-establishing a suite of native fauna on a large island in a semi-arid environment. A framework to guide this research has been prepared (Morris 2017) and this identifies three broad research themes to focus research programs. These research themes are a) better planning, implementing and monitoring fauna translocations, b) understanding the role and impacts of translocated fauna, and c) understanding the ecology and biology of threatened species.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently two research projects are being planned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a) Impact of pest species and translocated fauna on DHI ecosystems</strong></p>
<p><em>Monitoring house mice and small vertebrates</em></p>
<p>The house mouse and small vertebrate fauna of DHI were monitored from 2008-2013 (prior to eradication of sheep, goats and cats, and translocations of native fauna) by Shark Bay District staff. Eight monitoring sites were established encompassing most of the major vegetation types on the island. Each site consisted of two paired parallel lines of pit traps (each line consisted of 3 x 20 L bucket alternated with 3 x 150mm diam PVC tube, 60 cm deep) approximately 30 m apart. In addition two parallel lines of six medium Elliott traps were set approximately 10 m from the pit lines. The beginning and end of each pit line was marked with a dropper post, and the first pit trap in each line marked on a GPS. Monitoring was undertaken annually (usually in October/November) with traps open for 4-5 nights for each trapping session. Animals captured&nbsp;were identified, weighed and measured, and released after being temporarily marked (e.g. with a permanent marking pen). Species lists and relative abundances have been prepared for each trapping site, and this equates to baseline data (pre-removal of pest species and before arrival of translocated species). These pit lines also offer the opportunity to sample and document the larger invertebrate fauna of DHI, which has not previously been undertaken.</p>
<p>These monitoring sites will be surveyed again in October / November 2017 and each year for at least the next seven years. Additional monitoring sites may be added in November 2017 to cover some vegetation types that are not adequately sampled at present (e.g. <em>Triodia</em> dominated sites, coastal sites). Animals captured will be processed as before and data recorded on datasheets. Animals that can not be confidently identified at site will be taken back to camp for identification using field keys. Some tissue (scale, tail tip etc) may be taken for DNA analysis. All animals will be released alive near the point of capture unless a new species for DHI is captured, in which case it will be either euthanased and preserved, or transported to Perth and provided to the WA Museum.</p>
<p><strong>b) Better planning, implementing and monitoring fauna translocations</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>Prey abundance and release site selection for dibblers on Dirk Hartog Island National Park</em></p>
<p>The Endangered dibbler (<em>Parantechinus</em> apicalis) is one of the 10 species of mammal proposed for reintroduction to Dirk Hartog Island (DHI), in the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, as part of the DHI Ecological Restoration Project. If successful the establishment of a dibbler population on this 60 000 ha island would substantially improve its overall abundance and distribution and potentially lead to an improvement in its conservation status. One of the keys to the successful re-establishment of dibblers on DHI is their release in suitable habitat with adequate leaf litter and invertebrate food source. Assessments of these factors are recommended prior to any dibbler translocation.</p>
<p>Reintroduction of dibblers to DHI is planned for both October 2018 (sub adults) and May 2019 (females with pouch young). Prior to this DHI needs to be surveyed for a) leaf litter and ground debris, and b) medium-large invertebrates (&gt; 3mm length) that would be suitable as a dibbler food source. The sampling survey would be based around the existing north &ndash; south track which runs for the length of the island (ca 80 km), some east &ndash; west tracks that cross the island (up to 15 km), and some other limited access tracks. Survey methodology would follow previous dibbler food availability assessments. It would include mapping areas of litter and rating these as good / abundant litter, moderate / adequate litter, and poor / little or no litter. Invertebrate sampling at a selection of good, adequate and poor sites would then be undertaken. There would be the opportunity to determine any trends in litter and prey abundance on DHI, and for comparison of results with other assessments (e.g. Jurien Bay islands and mainland sites). Parks and Wildlife researchers would use the results of this work to identify suitable dibbler release sites.</p>

<p>SP2012-027 North Kimberley Landscape Conservation Initiative: monitoring and evaluation</p>","<p>The benefits of integrated landscape management are variable across threatened taxa, which have variable susceptibility to threats and responses to management. Priority Threat Management identified introduced predator control, introduced herbivore control, weed management and fire management as cost-effective actions for managing DBCA assets in the Kimberley (Cawardine 2012, Cons Letters 5(3)196:204). Feral herbivore control was identified as a cost-effective threat management strategy for conserving many threatened and endemic species in the Kimberley, particularly it&rsquo;s small mammal fauna, but the current program is not optimised spatially, rather regional staff annually design a logistically efficient approach within existing budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Efficiency and cost-effectiveness could be increased by optimising delivery of this high cost process to maximise biodiversity benefits through two key improvements: (1) characterisation of utility thresholds (i.e. the thresholds at which efficiency and impact decrease below a useful level) to inform; i.e. how much shooting is enough, and (2) impact focused spatial action planning, to identify spatially explicit management strategies that balance the conservation needs of multiple species while accounting for other funds and opportunities in that timestep</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Structured Decision Making (SDM) is a formal collaborative process designed to facilitate decision making in multi objective, value-laden contexts characterized by limited resources, uncertainty, and difficult trade-offs such as these (Gregory 2012). Challenges in the Kimberly that met these criteria were collaboratively identified with Kimberley region staff. Emerging from this process domains of management that would benefit from the application of structured decision making were identified. Three of these key challenges are 1) optimising herbivore management to minimise cost while ensuring the program continues to meet biodiversity goals, 2) understanding and characterising synergies and trade-offs, and identifying thresholds to change management (e.g. the most cost-effective strategy may have poor outcomes for particular sites or assets), and 3) understanding the utility of monitoring in this context.</p>","<p>The aim of this research is to apply Structured Decision Making collaboratively with the Kimberley region and district fauna managers, BCS scientists, and stakeholders to identify cost-effective feral herbivore control strategies.</p>
<p>(1) evaluate the costs and benefits of existing and proposed herbivore control strategies</p>
<p>(2) understand and characterise synergies and trade-offs among alternative management strategies for herbivore control</p>","<p>Support cost-effective herbivore management, define decision triggers, identify high-value information (and in so doing inform monitoring and research), and support transparency and accountability in the Kimberley landscape management portfolio.</p>

<p>Pintor, A., Kennard, M., &Aacute;lvarez-Romero, J.G., Hernandez, S., 2019. Prioritising threatened species and threatening processes across northern Australia.</p>","<p>The research will be conducted in a Structured Decision Making Framework. Using track log data, and other opportunistically acquired occurrence data (e.g. staff observations, feral scan), we will estimate feral herbivore distribution and occurrence and identify hotspots of activity using methods developed in the Pilbara (Kinloch, 2019). The structured decision making process will be supported by collaborative workshops to identify, document and incorporate the full suite of objectives, constraints and barriers, incorporate diverse values, and collaboratively design feasible alternative management strategies.</p>
<p>To support a spatially explicit decision model, the project will collate, process, and serve aerial shoot track log data from DBCA, and other control data from across the region, developing repeatable data pipelines. Biodiversity assets (Native species and communities) negatively impacted by each of the Large Feral Herbivore taxa (LFH) targeted for control will be identified through a combination of expert knowledge, review of recovery plans, grey and published literature. For each, the susceptibility to LFH will be documented in collaboration with regional experts. Occurrence of impacted species will be modelled using a combination of minimum convex polygons, kernel density estimates and habitat suitability and species distribution models depending on data availability for the species, building on and incorporating recently developed models generated by the NESP Northern Hub (Pintor et al., 2019). &nbsp;A cost evaluation template will be developed and costs estimated based on existing program costs in collaboration with the region. A set of feasible management strategies will be collaboratively developed with Kimberley staff and the expected cost and benefit of each evaluated. A range of models will be explored for predicting expected benefit including structured elicitation, a bayesian belief network model, and GLMM&rsquo;s, depending on data availability for the final set of species identified as susceptible. Cost-effective strategies for multiple taxa will be evaluated using a spatially explicit Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, and trade-offs strategies across multiple taxa evaluated.</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,not required,"<p>Data will be archived with metadata following best practice Data Management Protocols, e.g. <a href=""https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/survey-manual/5029-fundamental-science-practices-preservation"">https://www.usgs.gov/about/organization/science-support/survey-manual/5029-fundamental-science-practices-preservation</a> at <a href=""https://data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/"">https://data.dpaw.wa.gov.au/</a> within 6 months of project completion.

1979,,"<p>&lt;p&gt;There has been continuing significant environmental and ecological change in the Australian arid zone since European colonisation commenced during the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. The introduction of highly efficient predators and hard-hooved herbivores has resulted in massive on-going damage to ecosystems and loss of species that depend on them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One species that has been impacted is the night parrot (&lt;em&gt;Pezoporus occidentalis&lt;/em&gt;), classified as critically endangered under WA legislation, endangered under the Commonwealth EPBC Act, and listed as one of the Commonwealth government&amp;rsquo;s 20 bird species by 2020. The species has been very difficult to detect because of its highly cryptic and nocturnal nature. Until the recent research in Queensland (e.g. Murphy &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2017), there was an almost complete lack of biological or ecological knowledge of the species. Surveys for the species are still restricted to roosting habitat, because foraging habitat is barely known, and is completely unknown in WA. Until this year, the only reliable records from WA in the last two decades were from the Fortescue Marsh and Matuwa but lack of knowledge of foraging and roosting habits of the species has hampered progress. Then, in March of this year a single bird was photographed, and others heard, at a different site in the Shire of Wiluna. Brief repeat surveys have indicated that night parrots have remained in the area up until at least late August 2017 (e.g. Hamilton &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;. 2017b).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Night parrots are much less common and less widespread than previously known and, where investigated, appear to occur at extremely low population densities. They are presumably declining slowly. However, this decline is likely to escalate as development proposals in and near inland salt lakes become more common, as is currently happening. These sites appear to support the major occurrences of roosting habitat in WA, and presumably reflect the presence of nearby foraging habitat. It is therefore critical that we determine the extent of the species in WA, and its local roosting and habitat preferences, to inform environmental impact assessment (EIA) and subsequent management for this highly susceptible species. Recent media interest has also highlighted the profile of night parrots, and the importance of being able to demonstrate that we can manage the increasing threats to its existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This proposal is consistent with DBCA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Strategic Directions 2018&amp;ndash;21&amp;rsquo; (Undertake world-recognised science to build and share biodiversity knowledge to support evidence-based decision making and management), objectives set out in the department&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;framework for fauna conservation&amp;rsquo; (2016) (threatened species recovery), and priorities addressed in the Science and Conservation Division Strategic Plan 2014-17 (knowledge gaps; threatened species recovery). The Night Parrot Recovery Team has a draft research plan, and has commenced drafting a national recovery plan. The DBCA Night Parrot Technical Advisory Panel (including relevant departmental science and regional staff, plus relevant independent experts) has drafted research priorities for WA. This concept plan is consistent with these documents and processes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>","<div class=""col-sm-12"">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-term aims &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This proposal has four related, long-term aims:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1.Understand the basic ecology of the night parrot in WA, in order to create a detailed habitat suitability model for predicting night parrot distribution;&lt;br /&gt; 2. Determine the true status of the night parrot in WA through improvement in understanding of the population demography (size, distribution and structure);&lt;br /&gt; 3. Understand the bird&amp;rsquo;s patterns of decline, and assess past, current and future threats acting on night parrot populations; and&lt;br /&gt; 4. Engage with Traditional Owners (especially Martu people) to encourage survey for night parrots and sensitive management for the species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work over the last two decades &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The department has responded to high veracity opportunistic reports and has supported searching effort in and near Matuwa. Support has come mostly from Goldfields Region (up to about $10,000 p.a. over several years), supplemented by a considerable amount of volunteer time and in-kind support from a range of observers (some of whom are also DBCA staff members volunteering their time). Approximately 1 TB of sound recording files have been accumulated for analysis. Capture work last year was funded by Goldfields Region and the University of Queensland (Nick Leseberg PhD project). This opportunistic work has revealed that (1) habitat usage in WA differs from that in SA and Queensland, and (2) likely sites of occupancy are also sites that are often highly prospective for some forms of resource extraction, particularly for potash. Unfortunately, it is proving difficult to provide sound advice with respect to EIA, because we only have scant knowledge concerning distribution and feeding habitat preferences. Further resources are needed to enable the gathering of relevant information, especially concerning habitat preferences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Work proposed under this concept plan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Assess the spatial extent of the population in the area in and surrounding Matuwa/Lorna Glen. This will then be extended to the entire Lake Carnegie catchment (in which suitable habitat persists, and in which various mining and exploration tenements also occur). This would then be followed by survey (or re-survey) of other known/prospective areas such as Fortescue Marsh, Lake Maitland, Lake Nabberu catchment.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;(Undertaken concurrently with 1.) Determine where the birds are foraging, through the use of GPS tags. Specifically, we will identify vegetation types are they using and the spatial relationship between roosting and foraging habitat, and identify use and importance of water points.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build on the above data to determine differences in the vegetation at occupied versus non-occupied roost sites and foraging sites. We will also determine the fire history and grazing history of the sites and identify and rank a suite of habitat variables at different scales to inform predictive models to aid in future searches. This information is needed to underpin successful management and guide survey efforts for EIA.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;</div>","<p>Assessment of the spatial extent of the population in the area in and surrounding Matuwa/Lorna Glen, and subsequently the entire Lake Carnegie catchment.

</ul>","<p>DBCA undertakes species translocations to support four goals: 1) improve the conservation status of threatened taxa, 2) manage genetic diversity of disjunct populations, 3) re-establish species in areas where they have experienced local extirpation and threats have been ameliorated, 4) reconstruction of species assemblages to restore ecosystem &lsquo;health&rsquo;. Translocation is a valuable conservation tool that can yield significant benefits but is costly and high risk. Decisions on translocations must include thorough consideration of potential benefits, weighed against costs and risks of the translocation and alternative options. Use of structured decision making (SDM) is recommended best-practice for managing translocation risks (IUCN SSC 2013 Guidelines for Reintroductions and other conservation translocations Version 1.0). The goal of this research is to embed SDM into translocation decisions across DBCA and provide greater transparency to the translocation decision-making process. In addition to translocations managed by DBCA, other state government departments and NGOs also request animals to support their reintroduction programs. It is important to manage source and translocated populations holistically so that genetic diversity of all populations (within WA and nationally) is maximised, and risks to source populations are minimised.</p>","<ol>
<li>Develop a strategic departmental framework for animal translocation decision making that uses SDM to support decisions</li>
<li>Identify strategic priorities for translocation for the next five years:</li>
</ol>
<p>The project will apply SDM to a range of case studies to identify core principles. Case studies will focus on species for which translocations are proposed over the next three to five years as part of interstate safe haven construction which have source populations or proposed release sites in Western Australia, such as woylies, and embedding SDM into the Dirk Hartog Island (DHI) multi-species translocation. The case studies will to identify safe low-risk collection strategies that maximise conservation benefits for all target species and balance multiple competing demands for animals with the risks and benefits to each species, and provide exemplars for future single and multi-species translocations. This will then inform a well-supported and robust framework for translocation decision making.</p>","<p>An explicit approach to assessing single and multi-species translocation risks and benefits will be developed, supporting more transparent and accountable risk management, and ultimately enhancing translocation success, source population security, and improving species conservation outcomes. Consequently, it will result in the development of novel methods, guidelines for translocation, and increased literacy in and understanding of SDM with translocation partners (both within and external to DBCA). This project will also help to fill a knowledge and process gap and inform a strategic approach to translocation decision making within WA and nationally.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Translocation risks, strategic benefits and costs were raised by five of seven regions in consultation about recurring challenges where SDM could increase benefits and accountability. Using SDM as a routine method to manage translocation risks also aligns DBCA with global best practice, as recommended in the IUCN SSC 2013 Guidelines for Reintroductions and other conservation translocations (Version 1.0).</p>
<p>Contributes to the following BCS strategic goals and key deliverables including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biodiversity, conservation and recovery programs are based on scientific knowledge &ndash; Recommendations regarding conservation actions necessary to maintain sustainable populations, or recovery of, targeted species including the management of threatening processes; recommendations regarding the conservation status of targeted species; purpose-specific optimal monitoring strategies</li>
<li>Understanding of the effects and opportunities for mitigation of pressures and threats to terrestrial ecosystems &ndash; recommended strategies to enhance the resilience of native fauna to habitat disturbance.</li>
<li>Scientific knowledge is available to inform adaptive management and decision making &ndash; development of decision support tools to improve capacity to make timely and effective management decisions.</li>
<li>Conservation advice is based on scientific information &ndash; translation of research outputs in formats appropriate to the target audience to encourage adoption.</li>
<li>Effective science partnerships enhance conservation outcomes - identification of external collaborative conservation research opportunities to deliver on shared goals.</li>
</ul>","<p>The key users of the process will be the Species and Communities and Animal Science Programs internally and other stakeholders requesting consultation in relation to proposed translocations. The process is explicitly transdisciplinary. It is co-designed with Species and Communities and Animal Science Programs. Case studies will be conducted with extensive collaboration with stakeholders, including consultation about their objectives, constraints, and the opportunity to co-develop alternative management strategies. The case study approach will facilitate the incorporation of diverse perspectives, by capturing the broad array of goals and constraints across taxa. Indeed, all major stakeholders including AWC, SA, NT, and NSW government departments have been engaged in consultation around the process and as alternatives develop. Species and Communities have brokered discussions with NSW and NT governments and are developing an MOU with AWC. Other consultations are via recovery teams, and workshops with translocation proponents on a per-species basis. A partnership with DEWLP and Monash has also been developed to extend the research with a student project over the coming 2 years using the woylie model and dataset developed as part of this project.</p>

726,"<p>This SPP designed to include small wetland survey projects such as the Hutt Catchments Survey (SPP 2007-010). Larger survey projects with similar methods and objectives are the biological surveys of the Carnarvon Basin, Wheatbelt survey (SPP1998-020) and Pilbara (SPP2004-002 and 2004-004).</p>","<p>&nbsp; There have been several regional scale surveys of aquatic invertebrates in Western Australia, including the Warren region (Horwitz 1994), the Southern Carnarvon Basin (Halse et al. 2000), the Wheatbelt (Pinder et al. 2004) and the Pilbara (Pinder et al. 2010a). While these larger scale surveys provide analyses of biodiversity patterning for regional-scale conservation planning, sites are usually too sparse for more local scale planning. However, the larger surveys can be used to identify subregions of high biodiversity (such as Biodiversity Recovery Catchments in the Wheatbelt), which then require more detailed survey for local conservation planning. In the Wheatbelt smaller scale aquatic invertebrate surveys have been carried out in the Drummond (Pinder et al. 2011), Buntine-Marchagee (Aquatic Research Laboratory 2009), Bryde (Cale et al. 2008) and Muir-Unicup (A. Storey [UWA] and DEC unpublished) Recovery Catchments. Another of the Walshe et al. (2004) potential recovery catchments, the Hutt Lagoon/Hutt River Catchments, was similarly surveyed for aquatic invertebrates by Quinlan et al. (2009). Each of these smaller scale surveys have informed conservation planning, such as setting biodiversity targets (e.g. Drummond Nature Reserve and Lake Toolibin), prioritization of conservation actions (Buntine-Marchagee) and planning and monitoring engineering works (e.g. by providing baseline data, e.g. Bryde and Warden wetlands). There is a strong overlap with some of the smaller aquatic invertebrate monitoring work that has been undertaken where the monitoring is for wetlands with few other data &ndash; so the monitoring data also provides information on biodiversity patterning. This is the case for mound springs east of Eneabba (Pinder and Leung 2010) and the Lake Warden wetlands (Pinder et al. 2010b) and I suggest that these small scale (and intermittent) monitoring projects be run under this SPP).</p>","<p>The aims of the surveys covered by this SPP are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide understanding of medium scale (catchment/wetland system) aquatic biodiversity patterning to inform local conservation planning and as baselines for future monitoring.</li>
<li>To provide better data on the distribution, ecological tolerances and conservation status of aquatic fauna species and communities.</li>
</ul>","<p>Knowledge of the distribution of species and composition of communities has a myriad of benefits to DEC&rsquo;s core conservation work. Data collected to date has been used as baselines for monitoring management actions, prioritization of wetland conservation actions based on invertebrate community composition, identification of threatened ecological communities and assessment of species conservation status and setting biodiversity targets (see &lsquo;background&rsquo; above). Some of this data has also been used for environmental impact assessment. Much of this data has also been provided to external researchers and students for separate projects that also have direct benefit for DEC.</p>","<p>Primary users of the knowledge coming out of these projects are DEC conservation managers, including those in regional offices, Species and Communities Branch, Natural Resources Management Branch and Environmental Management Branch. This knowledge is primarily transferred to the above users via reports and oral presentations tailored to the needs of particular managers (usually those that provided the funding). Where possible, scientific papers will also be written (e.g. Pinder et al. in review).</p>","<p>There are no set timelines for this SPP as it covers one or more surveys at a time, each with their own milestones and timelines. Some years there may be no surveys run under this SPP. All previous surveys have been completed on time.</p>

This is dependent on the objectives of each survey, but usually involves selecting a suite of wetlands that best represent the diversity of gross physical and chemical wetland types (fresh to saline, ephemeral to permanent, vegetation type etc.), geographical spread and with replication (where possible) within these types. Stakeholders are usually involved in, or review, site selections.</p>
<p><strong>Aquatic invertebrate sampling</strong>. Collecting usually involves sweep netting using techniques, mesh sizes and sample sizes that are compatible with all other DEC aquatic invertebrate sampling (which has become a standard outside of DEC for some other research groups).</p>
<p><strong>Physical/chemical habitat descriptions</strong>. A variety of water chemistry variables are normally measured. At a minimum, pH, conductivity and temperature are measured in the field. If funds allow, then variables requiring laboratory analysis are performed at NATA registered external laboratories. Such analyses include nutrients, chlorophyll (as a surrogate for planktonic algal biomass) concentrations of major ions, turbidity, alkalinity and hardness). Sediment composition is either estimated by eye (% surface cover of fine sediments, sand+gravel, pebble+cobble etc.) or by taking samples of fine sediments and determining particle size composition in the laboratory. Submerged macrophyte cover is estimated by eye or macrophyte dry biomass is determined from samples taken from quadrats.</p>
<p><strong>Identifications</strong>. As far as possible, invertebrates are identified to species/morphospecies level using a reference specimen collection held at Woodvale and largely verified by external taxonomists. External taxonomic assistance is sought where needed.</p>
<p><strong>Waterbird surveys</strong>. As a rule, all waterbirds on a wetland are counted and identified using binoculars and spotting scopes from the ground, unless the wetland is very large and then the portion of the wetland surveyed is documented. Aerial surveys from fixed wing aircraft are occasionally performed.</p>

2840,<p>There are no research projects that relate directly to the prioritisation of social science research within DBCA broadly or BCS programs specifically. The Supervising Scientist has had a number of meetings with the Executive Director of BCS as regards the framing and implementation of this research.</p>,"<p>Strategic planning of science is undertaken by Biodiversity and Conservation Science (BCS) to identify appropriate science that in turn supports the Strategic Directions of DBCA. This ensures that the science delivered is usefully directed through BCS scientific programs to support DBCA business processes. This approach contributes to ensuring effective delivery of biodiversity and conservation science that is collaborative, innovative, ethical and outcome driven. Useful science provides timely information upon which DBCA decisions can be based and defended, and enhances the return-on-investment of DBCA funding and resources for core business activities.</p>
<p>Many business processes within DBCA occur at the intersection of ecological, economic and social systems. BCS is well recognised for delivering excellent ecological science that informs biodiversity conservation. Social science is recognised by BCS as an important complement to ecological science for supporting the strategic directions of DBCA.</p>
<p>Identifying current and future social science research priorities is an important activity for conservation organisations. Current priority topics for DBCA can meet immediate departmental needs, whilst anticipating future needs can promote increasingly effective allocation of time, funding and resources through well-targeted research. Priority social science research priorities should be feasible, present a high likelihood of being delivered effectively, cost-efficient and equitable.</p>
<p>Expert elicitation comprises a suite of often context-specific methodologies that are widely used in conservation, but less commonly so to identify priority research directions for organisations and the individuals within them. It can apply scientific techniques to systematically anticipate, identify and examine current information gaps usefully filled by research (resources permitting), as well as future information needs. Social science prioritised through expert elicitation methodologies can provide information that enhances evidence-based decision-making, program cost-efficiency, targeted conservation actions, and, ultimately, a positive perception of DBCA by the public.</p>","<p>The proposed research aims to identify priority social science research questions, the answers to which can support delivery of DBCA business processes by enhancing the evidence-base, effectiveness and cost-efficiency of activities delivering DBCA Corporate Strategic Directions. <br /><br />Specifically, this research project aims to provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>The basis for a developing a small number of social science research projects.</li>
<li>A process for complementing the social science research activities of BCS with those of PVS.</li>
<li>A process for informally enhancing the understanding of staff in key management roles as to the scope and utility of social science as applied to conservation activities.</li>
</ol>","<p>The identification of priority social science research topics can assist in supporting the achievement of five DBCA Strategic Directions including: Biodiversity and conservation; Natural and cultural values; Attractions; Fire management; and Our community and partners. Such social science can be enacted in many ways, including, for example: 1) the building of partnerships between DBCA and stakeholder groups such as Traditional Owners, resource user groups and the public; 2) the design and evaluation of volunteer, citizen science and community engagement programs that can educate and inspire the broader public, and; 3) the engagement of the community in nature-based tourism.</p>
<p>Specifically, this research project aims to deliver:</p>
<ol>
<li>A small number of social science research projects developed as Science Concept Plans for consideration by the Executive Director BCS, and subsequently the BCS Leadership Team.</li>
<li>An explicit strategy for matching the social science research activities of BCS to those of PVS.</li>
<li>An enhanced understanding by staff in key management roles of the scope and utility of conservation social science.</li>
</ol>","<p>The outputs and outcomes generated by the proposed project can be exchanged with staff across DBCA. In the first instance, and following discussion with the Executive Director BCS, it will be useful and appropriate to return information on the findings of the study to participants. Once approval of a small set of research projects has been approved by the Executive Director BCS, discussions can begin with relevant staff to develop research questions into project ideas, which can then be documented as Science Concept Plans. Science Concept Plans can then be circulated to the BCS Leadership Team for their consideration for approval. More generally, feedback could be provided broadly to DBCA staff through circulation of a short, written summary of the findings and/or a presentation to staff.</p>","<p>Progress of this project can be tracked across these necessary Tasks, Milestones, Outputs, and Timeframes to ensure that this proposed research is completed effectively:</p>

<p>A simple expert elicitation methodology will be employed for identifying and prioritizing social science research questions. It will be structured to minimize factors with the potential to compromise the integrity of expert elicitation studies, including scoring fatigue, cognitive biases, &lsquo;group think&rsquo;. The study will adhere to the research ethics standards of DBCA, which adheres to the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (NHMRC 2018a) and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (NHMRC 2018b). Social science will be broadly defined as topics of study of broad relevance to society and the manner in which people behave and influence the world around them (per the Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom), which recognises that &ldquo;social science&rdquo; is not a discipline per se, but rather a collection of disciplines focused upon social inquiry.</p>
<p>The proposed methodology is composed of the following five steps:</p>
<p><em>Step 1: Scoping</em><br />Literature will be purposively identified from a small range of disciplines on the topics of research scanning, foresight and expert judgement using searches in Web of Science and the snowballing method. Literature focused on conservation or environmental topics will not be preferred, given the relative novelty of these techniques in these disciplines. The methodology aims to be rapid, cost-efficient and testable as an approach for future application.</p>
<p>A simple assessment of purposively identified information will be conducted to identify the policy context (per Clark 2002) to determine: 1) the scope of responsibilities and accountabilities of DBCA as a government agency (to understand what social science might be appropriate); 2) the business processes through which DBCA functions (to understand how social science might be enacted); and 3) existing social science activities (to avoid duplication of research effort, so as to ensure harmonious working relationships between sections and ensure cost-efficient operations, which is mandated by WA government). Information on the policy context could include documents outlining: corporate strategic directions (DBCA 2019a,b,c); legislation and policy administered or enacted by DBCA, e.g., the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016; the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984; the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; and DBCA internal operations (e.g., CITS).</p>
<p><em>Step 2: Question elicitation</em> <br />Expert information and knowledge are commonly used for decision-making across a wide range of sectors, and is essential when data is limited or absent, or the time and resources required to gather desired information is unavailable (Burgman 2016). Expert-based approaches are commonly used by conservation organisations (CITS; Pullin; Cowling et al. 2003).</p>
<p>Groups of experts representing diverse characteristics typically perform more effectively than homogeneous groups or individuals, and so should be constituted judiciously (Burgman 2016). Experts will be purposively sampled using explicit criteria to identify staff representative of: 1) departmental organizational structure; 2) legislative, regulatory and policy responsibilities and accountabilities; 3) professional experience with operations and history of the department; and 4) availability. Managers of Branches, Programs, Regions and Units across the four Directorates responsible for developing or implementing policy or action most directly met these criteria (see Supporting Information 1). A broad sample from across the department will be required to ensure the full scope of potential relevant topics are addressed. This method accounts for confounding factors such as sample size and the level of conformity within the group.</p>
<p>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants. Participants will be briefed on: 1) the purpose and context of the research; 2) the scope and utility of social science generally, and in conservation specifically (as very few participants probably have experience with or qualifications in any of the social sciences); 3) the ethical scope of the research; and 4) the proposed interview process. Participants will be offered the opportunity to ask questions about the research process.</p>
<p>Priority topics identified by participants will be discussed to tease-out their specific context, bounds, elements, interrelationships, stakeholder&rsquo;s perspectives and barriers to the outcomes sought by the participant. Dialogue will be used to refine a topic into a research question. The process will be repeated three times to identify three research questions in priority order. All interviews will be audio recorded (with the consent of participants) and written notes taken to complement them.</p>
<p><em>Step 3: Thematic analysis</em> <br />Thematic analysis is a commonly used technique for identifying common and contrasting topics from qualitative data. Research questions will be transcribed and manually and subjectively categorized into themes meaningful to the Supervising Scientist. A second reviewer may repeat this process to develop an understanding of the degree of subjectively of the research questions identified. A single research question will be synthesized from the collection of research questions under each theme. Research questions will be logged into an Excel worksheet and ranked according to the number of times it is mentioned collectively by participants. Approximately seven of the most commonly mentioned themes will be ranked and adopted for subsequent participant ranking, this number representing a widely accepted limit of reasonable robustness by an expert.</p>
<p><em>Step 4: Question ranking of research questions</em><br />Digital expert elicitation approaches using email, internet-based, social media or multi-method techniques are increasingly used for expert elicitation. An online method is appropriate where it can &lsquo;crowd-source&rsquo; information, be used to build consensus over short timeframes, multiple participants can be approached using work email addresses, and a research topic that is narrowly and well-defined (as it is in this study). The survey was open from 08:33 on Tuesday 6th July to 12:00 on Friday 17th July 2020.</p>
<p>Participants will be invited via email that contained a link to the online questionnaire one week after completing an interview to complete a two-item questionnaire on the Qualtrics&trade; online platform. The second item will comprise the seven most commonly mentioned research questions presented in a randomized order using a &lsquo;Rank Order&rsquo; item type requiring participants to click-and-drag the seven questions into a ranked list.</p>
<p><em>Step 5: Synthesis</em><br />Participant&rsquo;s responses will be exported into Excel to generate simple descriptive statistics for synthesis as a final priority ranking of conservation social science research questions. This will include medians, modes, frequency spread, relative ranking of individual research questions and a comparison of the three highest versus three lowest sets of research questions.</p>",granted,False,,not required,False,not required,"<p>Notes and descriptive data will be archived, maintained on the T:\ drive and my computer, and backed up regularly.

A decline in rainfall since the 1970s and increased frequency of heatwaves have resulted in declining groundwater levels, reduced streamflow, and less plant-available water.&amp;nbsp;Concurrently, past management of the forest for timber production have produced legacies of altered stand structure. Portions of the forests are currently characterised by dense stands of regrowth, which may be increasingly vulnerable to warming and drying because they use more water than a more mature forest. There may also be flow-on consequences of these changes in water availability and use for the biodiversity that the forest sustains, including for riparian ecosystems and habitats.</p>
<p>This project expands on SPP 2000-003 (Hydrological response to timber harvesting and associated stand management in the intermediate rainfall zone of the northern jarrah forest) and SPP 2011-20 (Long-term stand dynamics of regrowth forest in relation to site productivity and climate), both of which will be closed. SPP 2000-003 provided an important, long-term record of the groundwater and stream flow responses of the jarrah forest (via the Yarragil catchments) to a drying climate and forest thinning. Hydrological responses to a recent thinning, in 2019, will continue to be monitored by this new project.</p>
<p>Knowledge gaps remain regarding the coupling of the forest to groundwater and the unsaturated zone and there remains a need to develop ecohydrological models to support decision making regarding forest management for biodiversity and forest resilience outcomes. SPP 2011-20 demonstrated the effects of forest thinning on growth and inter tree competition in regrowth stands of jarrah and karri, and produced important information on thinning activities in relation to &lt;em&gt;Armillaria&lt;/em&gt; root disease and organic matter build up. However, that project had a timber resource focus so did not address many of the ecological questions that we now need answered about forest health, fuel loads, fauna habitat and biodiversity responses. This new project will build on the outcomes of these previous projects and will help fill knowledge gaps regarding forest conservation and management under the challenges of ongoing and predicted climate change, as outlined in the FMP 2024-2033.</p>
<p>One of the main intervention techniques to help the forest adjust to a drying and warming climate is to alter forest stand structure via thinning to reduce competition for water. A range of thinning trials were established as part of harvesting for timber production in southwestern Australia in the past 50 years. These show that thinning can increase available water, increase protection of riparian zones and other habitats, and increase growth rates of remaining trees.&amp;nbsp;However, the ecological implications of thinning for conservation outcomes are less well known.</p>
<p>To understand how thinning may assist in increasing the resilience of south-west forests to a drying and warming climate, this project will investigate three main components: 1) climate drivers and forest health: that is, how forest responds to climate variability under differing management treatments; 2) hydrology: how forest structure and health influence and in turn are influenced by the storage of water in the vadose and groundwater zones and how this in turn influences streamflow and evapotranspiration; and 3) thinning: can changing stem number (functional sapwood, basal area) increase resilience, and what are the ecological responses to thinning. In addition, the forest, with and without thinning, will experience disturbance interactions such as fire, pests, pathogens, and thus these will also be investigated.</p>
<p>Previous social research suggests that in some areas thinning may not be palatable to the wider community. This requires further work to understand attitudes and perceptions to thinning and forest management.&amp;nbsp</p>","<p>The aim of this project is to examine the potential of stand management such as thinning to maintain or increase forest ecosystem resilience and inform management for forest adaptation to climate change. Specifically, aims include:</p>
<p>Climatic drivers and forest health</p>
<p>Examine, using remote sensing and geophysics, depth to groundwater and bedrock, when and where forest cover changes are occurring, to identify key thresholds and inform stand management.</p>
<p>Examine responses of thinned forest, riparian zones, dense regrowth, and old growth, during drought/ heatwaves using remote sensing (e.g., NDVI, i35, LAI).</p>
<p>Mine FORESTCHECK data for relationships between biological diversity, composition and stand density, e.g., examine the temperature and precipitation gradient across the forest to show impacts of a drying and warming climate on forest structure, composition, and function.</p>
<p>Maintain, periodically monitor (5-10yrs), and report on stand management measurements, e.g., population and health, for long-term trials in jarrah (Yarragil 4L, 4X, 6C, Wungong, Inglehope, Munro) and karri forest (Warren, Treen Brook, Sutton blocks).</p>
<p>Hydrology</p>
<p>Quantify hydrological responses (soil moisture, groundwater, surface water and evapotranspiration) to thinning and declining rainfall in experimental catchments and examine how forest structure regulates streamflow volumes/quality at landscape scales. Apply novel technologies, geophysics, remote sensing, water tracers and soil analyses to measure these responses.</p>
<p>Develop models for landscape-scale assessment of ecohydrological responses to climate change and management such as thinning.</p>
<p>Undertake research to understand water use and responses to thinning of key forest species.</p>
<p>Thinning</p>
<p>Examine habitat values and use (foraging, roosting, nesting) of thinned and unthinned catchments (e.g., Wungong) by fauna (key species and broader diversity measures) using novel techniques (e.g., eco-acoustics, camera traps, eDNA) and compare with traditional methods.</p>
<p>Examine carbon dynamics of thinned and unthinned catchments and ForestCheck plots and clarify allometrics and provide more accurate above and below ground carbon accounting.</p>
<p>Identify the effects of thinning on forest function (e.g., water, soil carbon, nutrients, microbes), and soil disturbance (movement, compaction), and understorey diversity (Wungong, Munro).</p>
<p>Quantify herbicide residue following thinning operations.</p>
<p>Interactions</p>
<p>Examine the vulnerability of thinned and unthinned forest blocks to high severity fire.</p>
<p>Quantify fuel loads and fire potentials following different methods of thinning using standard and publishable fuels surveys, for older (e.g., Wungong) and newly thinned sites (e.g., Munro, Hamilton).</p>
<p>Examine the responses of Phytophthora cinnamomi -affected forest, in thinned and unthinned areas using remote sensing techniques, validated with in situ data collection.</p>
<p>Social licence</p>
<p>Quantify current attitudes regarding forest thinning. Build on the Beckwith et al. (2010) study from Wungong to determine attitudes to longer-term forest development after thinning.</p>
<p>Assist with demonstration sites to increase understanding of forest thinning.</p>","<p>A clearer understanding of the responses of forest ecosystems to climate change with and without intervention activities such as thinning.</p>
<p>Findings will be shared with EHB and FMB as part of the FMP implementation via guidelines, manuals, and procedures. Outputs will include journal papers, presentations, science notes, etc., as required.</p>","<p>The outcomes and outputs generated by the SPP will be directly used by DBCA staff, including staff from Remote Sensing, Forest Management Branch, and various Districts. Research findings from the project will be integrated into management planning, and management responses including future research. Knowledge gained will be delivered to relevant staff in the form of technical reports and presentations. Inclusion of staff from the Forest Management Branch, Remote Sensing and BGPA will ensure knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>Research findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals so that it is available to researchers and managers locally, nationally and internationally. Findings will also be communicated to a wide range of stakeholders through reports, seminars, and newsletters local media and popular articles, as required.&nbsp;</p>","<p>Climatic drivers and forest health</p>

3349,<p>N/A</p>,"<p>The increasing disturbance associated with the urbanisation of marine coastal systems is facilitating a phenomenon called ocean sprawl (Firth <em>et al</em>. 2016). This phenomenon sees the replacement of complex marine habitats with simplistic artificial structures and is directly associated with a decline in species richness and abundance (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015; Heery <em>et al</em>. 2017). Due to the difficulty in quantifying this decline, habitat type is often used as a proxy for marine and estuarine communities. The protection of these habitats is regularly seen as a mechanism for protecting overall diversity within a system (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effective management of an estuary system depends on sufficient ecological data and the extent and diversity of the component habitats (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Within the Swan-Canning Estuary (SCE), the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) has collected extensive ecological data through an environmental monitoring program. This program focuses on water quality but also includes biological indicators including fish and seagrass communities. These long-term data contribute towards the ongoing management of the SCE and establishing a range of targets used within the Swan Canning River Protection Strategy to promote ecological health.</p>
<p>Previous efforts have been made to describe the habitats within the SCE (Valesini <em>et al</em>. 2010; Valesini <em>et al</em>. 2018; Cottingham <em>et al</em>. 2023) and rely on sampling and surveys. Satellite and aerial imagery surveys have proven problematic as there are limitations associated with turbidity and depth, that restrict the ability to classify and map habitats. This often results in the deeper benthic habitats remaining largely unquantified (Valesini <em>et al</em>. 2010; Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Remote marine habitat mapping techniques (including tow-camera, drop-camera, swath acoustics and ROVs) are increasingly being used within these environments to better describe the extent, structure, and distribution of benthic habitats (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>
<p>Other approaches that classify habitats within coastal systems use the categorisation of dominant characteristics. Habitat classification systems (HCS) aim to describe all habitats within a determined region using mutually exclusive and easily identifiable categories to provide sufficient detail for effective management (Ball <em>et al</em>. 2006; Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Limitations of the HCS approach include the strong dependence on the size of the area being assessed and the influence of variation in biological assemblages over small distances (Davis <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>
<p>Seagrass is an important habitat in coastal areas and has been the focus of some research in the SCE focused on condition and health &nbsp;(Forbes &amp; Kilminster 2014; Kilminster &amp; Forbes 2014; Jung <em>et al</em>., 2022). Annual surveys of seagrass health and 5-yearly surveys of distribution are conducted as part of DBCA monitoring.&nbsp; This information, combined with benthic surveys can be used to establish distribution maps of habitat with repeatable methodologies.</p>","<p>This project will aim to improve habitat mapping approaches within the Swan-Canning Estuary through the following aims:</p>
<ol>
<li>Produce broadscale habitat mapping of the benthic habitat in the Lower Swan-Canning Estuary.</li>
<li>Map the distribution of species, communities and habitats for the Swan-Canning Estuary.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Aim 1: Produce broadscale habitat mapping of the benthic habitat in the Lower Swan-Canning Estuary</strong></p>
<p>Produce a broadscale benthic habitat map of the LSCE, which will assist in filling some of the knowledge gaps around benthic habitat diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2: Map the distribution of species, communities and habitats for the Swan Canning Estuary</strong></p>
<p>Develop and consolidate maps of key species and communities and identify areas of ecological significance in the SCE.</p>","<p>The project will provide a key understanding of the benthic habitats in the Lower Swan-Canning Estuary and the distribution of key species and communities by producing broadscale habitat and species distribution maps (geospatial shapefile layers). These maps will be used to inform management decision-making in the Swan-Canning Estuary, and more widely the Swan-Canning River Park. Additionally, the methodologies used in this project will act as a framework for extended habitat and species mapping studies within the upper reaches of the Swan and Canning Estuaries.</p>","<p>The project will include collaborations between DBCA Rivers and Estuaries Science (RES), the Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Murdoch University. A data-sharing agreement has been established between all parties involved, allowing the usage of data associated with this project.</p>
<p>At the end of the project, all outputs will be shared between the collaborators as well as other stakeholders involved as the second aim of the project develops. This will assist in identifying information gaps in habitat composition within the system.</p>","<p><strong>Aim 1: Produce broadscale habitat mapping of the benthic habitat in the Lower Swan-Canning Estuary</strong></p>
<p>Annual reporting will take place in the form of a milestone email sent to each of the partners. These reports will detail the progress of the mapping process, the steps used in the data collection and collation from each source along with processing and analysis of data. A final report will be produced at the end, including the full methodology and results used in the study and sent to all collaborators involved.</p>
<p>Where possible scientific publications of the findings of this phase, or broader project will be produced. This phase could provide insight into the distribution of benthic habitats in the LSCE and identify the effectiveness of the marine parks within the system in maintaining these habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2: Map the distribution of species, communities and habitats for the Swan Canning Estuary</strong></p>
<p>A review of existing maps of habitat, species and communities for Swan Canning and their location will be produced, resulting in the consolidation of existing maps into a singular location. In addition, new maps will be developed based on available datasets on agreed taxa. Annual reviews and updates will be given to all partners involved in this part of the project.</p>
<p>At the end of the project, both aims will be collated together to form a wider report documenting the habitat mapping findings in the Swan-Canning Estuary.</p>","<p>Ball, D., Blake, S., Plummer, A. and Victoria, P.

<p><strong>Study area</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The LSCE, the study area for the project, is a section of the SCE spanning from the Stirling Highway Bridge in East Fremantle, upstream to the Narrows Bridge and the Shelley Bridge in Perth.</p>
<p><strong>Drop camera imagery data collection</strong></p>
<p><strong>DBCA data</strong></p>
<p>The DBCA data will use images taken from the 2019 and February and March 2023 Habitat Mapping Survey along with bathymetric interfaces in the LSCE. Between the two sampling periods, approximately 6000 images across 51 transects in the LSCE were collected. The raw images and georeferencing (NMEA strings) data for this survey were supplied in-house.</p>
<p><strong>Murdoch/TNC data (MT data)</strong></p>
<p>The MT data were collected during the summer 2019 survey that investigated the distribution of <em>A. senhousia</em> within the LSCE and resulted in 2037 images using a drop-cam to record a video for each site.</p>
<p><strong>Shoreline ground-truthing</strong></p>
<p>Shallow shoreline ground truthing data were collected in early 2023 to help provide an understanding of habitat in the areas that were inaccessible by boat. Haphazard transects were conducted on foot at depths of less than 1.2 m across 17 sites over a distance of 14.14 km. Within these sites, 887 data points were collected which contributed to the computer training program.</p>
<p><strong>Satellite imagery data</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Satellite imagery data will be used alongside the drop-cam images and will be sourced by DBCA (via the Remote Sensing Branch at DBCA) for the same period as the above surveys and supplied in-house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Drop camera imagery data cleaning</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DBCA data</strong></p>
<p>Before analysis, unusable images, including those that are blurry, skewed and duplicated will be removed from the dataset. Using code written in R Statistical Programming, the usable images will be georeferenced using the NMEA GPS strings recorded in the photos. Using the NMEA string from the photo dates, the start and finish times of each string will be used as the survey start and end points. To identify images that fall within the survey time, the timestamps in the metadata of each image (synched at the beginning of each trip) will be used. Any images that are outside of the survey time will be discarded. Once cleaned, georeferenced, and survey images identified, shape files of the vessel track will be produced overlaid with the images taken. These will be displayed as points, with each point in the track corresponding to the image taken at that time. If images fail to align with the track during the survey time (as identified through R scripts), those images will be discarded.</p>
<p><strong>MT data</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Video data had already been used by Murdoch University and TNC in previous research projects and had been cleaned before DBCA obtained the data. The files were renamed relative to their site name and date of collection.</p>
<p>To overlay the MT video footage and DBCA images, a still image will be taken from each video at the last possible moment that renders a clear image of the substrate before the drop-cam frame contacts the sediment. As the frame will likely disturb the sediment, resulting in a plume, the images will be distorted, taking the image just before the drop-cam hits the sediment will avoid this issue. Each still image will be then saved with the site name from the video.&nbsp;Positioning data for each site was provided alongside the video data. These were used in conjunction with the output from the video analysis in the creation of shapefiles.</p>
<p><strong>Drop camera imagery analysis</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The still images from the DBCA and MT data will be analysed using ecological analytical techniques, such as Transect Measure (TM) or ReefCloud. Images analysed using TM will follow the methods outlined by Langlois et al. in the Standard Operating Procedure for Habitat Annotation using TransectMeaure (SOP) and work from Davis <em>et al.</em> (2015). Images analysed using ReefCloud will follow the approaches outlined in the .</p>
<p>In both instances, images will be analysed by classifying the benthic habitat to the lowest taxonomic level. After the classification of all images, a .csv file (known as a TransectMeasure Observation file for TM) will be produced and uploaded into R for statistical analysis. The data in the .csv, or alternative file will be used to calculate the percentage cover and species diversity of benthic habitat in the LSCE.</p>
<p><strong>Drop camera imagery data categorisation and confidence</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each image will be allocated a confidence threshold, with &gt;90% being high, 75-90% being medium, 50-75% being low and &lt;50% being unusable, applied. These confidence thresholds will allow for the use of data from images that would have otherwise been regarded as unusable. The overall confidence of analysis at each site will be spatially displayed in the spatial analysis software, QGIS, using the respective GPS coordinates and a spatial layer created for the individual habitat classifications.</p>
<p><strong>Drop camera imagery data spatial mapping and representation</strong></p>
<p>Image point data from the above analysis will be imported into spatial analytical software for interpolation at 20 m and 40 m grid cells. Contour maps will be produced showing the density of benthic habitats and will be validated using the ground-truthing datasets.</p>
<p><strong>Satellite imagery data incorporation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drop camera imagery data preparation</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combine the image analysis data with the satellite imagery those data with an overall confidence value of &gt;50% will be used. As the satellite imagery data is of such high resolution, keeping images with &gt;50% confidence will most likely result in an overlap between the drop-cam images and the satellite data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each record will need to be consolidated into its dominant classification (that being over 70%). This will reduce the data at each site to one classification. The overall spatial representation can therefore be comprised of multiple habitat types where these classifications change in dominance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Satellite imagery data training</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This step will use the broader categories established in the previous step to train and then validate the individual pixels of the satellite image to an associated habitat classification where possible. This step will likely require reiteration to ensure the best association of data is achieved. This training will be done through R-scripts produced and supplied by the DBCA Remote Sensing branch. Guidance will be sought from the same branch to achieve the best association in data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bathymetry cut-off</strong></p>
<p>During the data training process, there will be a threshold where the deeper water obscures the reliability of using satellite imagery. Where this reliability threshold occurs, the depth will be used to create a bathymetric cut-off. A combination of satellite imagery and drop-cam imagery will be used in the depths leading up to this threshold (shallower depths). Below this threshold, the benthic habitat will be classified using drop-cam imagery only.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aim 2: Map the distribution of species, communities and habitats for the Swan Canning Estuary</strong></p>
<p>Known species distribution data in the SCE will be collected from the literature, TNC, Murdoch University and the DBCA database. Once obtained, data will be cleaned and analysed within computer programming software, such as R or Python. To produce maps that are suitable for stakeholders and organisations, the data will be uploaded into mapping software, such as QGIS, and the species distributions will be overlaid with maps of the SCE to highlight areas of potential ecological significance.</p>",granted,False,<p>N/A</p>,required,False,not required,"<p><strong>Aim 1: Produce broadscale habitat mapping of the benthic habitat in the Lower Swan-Canning Estuary</strong></p>
<p>Raw images will be stored on external hard drives and uploaded to the DBCA Sharepoint, with each sampling dataset being stored in separate folders. Once raw images have been filtered and cleaned, the selected images will be uploaded and stored in separate folders on Sharepoint. All data, scripts and maps will be stored on Sharepoint going forward.</p>

3348,<p>None</p>,"<p>The occurrences of anoxia (no oxygen) and hypoxia (very low oxygen) are often observed in the bottom waters of many estuaries (Roberts <em>et al</em>., 2012), as a result of environmental conditions associated with the interaction between tides, riverine inflows, meteorological forcing and internal biogeochemical processes. The balance between tide-driven pulsing of oceanic water (saline water) and riverine inflows (fresh water) typically sets up a salt-wedge stratification pattern that restrict vertical mixing between oxygen-depleted bottom waters and oxygen-saturated upper water.</p>
<p>The extent and severity of oxygen depletion can vary across the estuary depending upon the hydrodynamic condition as well as biogeochemical processes such as mineralisation of organic matters, photosynthesis and sediment oxygen demand (Zhu <em>et al</em>, 2016). The negative impacts of persistent low oxygen on the estuarine internal nutrient loading and estuarine biota have been well documented (Howarth <em>et al</em>., 2011; Testa and Kemp, 2012), however finding long-term solutions remain a challenge in many parts of the world (Zhang <em>et al</em>., 2010).</p>
<p>The Swan River estuary is a diurnal, micro-tidal estuary which passes the city of Perth and discharges to the Indian Ocean at Fremantle in Western Australia. The upper estuary is a narrow, shallow and meandering channel, generally well-mixed in winter and partially to highly stratified in other seasons, depending on the salt-wedge and relative intensity of tidal mixing and gravitational circulation (O&rsquo;Callaghan <em>et al</em>., 2007). This morphology and dynamic cause the tide-driven salt wedge to reach the upper estuary.</p>
<p>Eutrophication-related oxygen depletion in the upper reaches of the Swan River estuary has been recorded and has contributed to poor water quality and fish deaths in 2003-2005, 2009 and 2012. As part of a multi-pronged strategy to mitigate the eutrophication in the estuary, side-stream supersaturation oxygenation plants have been installed in the upper reaches of the estuary in Guildford (in 2008) and Caversham (in 2011). Testing over five days of operation showed that these plants can influence oxygen conditions in the upper Swan River estuary over a stretch of 11.5km (Larsen <em>et al</em>., 2019). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Key performance indicators (KPI&rsquo;s) are in place to ensure the oxygenation plants achieve the target oxygen concentration. These are applied at the operational level as monitoring guideline and reported to the Minister for Environment as KPI target for the River Protection Strategy requiring that &gt;80% of all individual dissolved oxygen measurements in the oxygenation zone are above 4 mg/L.</p>
<p>Estuarine environments are complex and detailed investigations are required to ensure oxygenated water distribution is responsive to the changes in hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions. &nbsp;These are essential to improve the oxygenation in the Swan River estuary.</p>
<p>But these conditions are dynamic at many temporal scales. In addition, climate change needs to be factored into management of the oxygenation plants. &nbsp;Observations on the effect of climate change to freshwater, estuarine water coastal water and marine water have seen higher adverse impacts than predicted (IPCC, 2022). Since surface warming in 1950s, ocean acidification (as a result of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere) and deoxygenation are identified as key threatening factors to the biodiversity of aquatic environment, particularly in estuarine waters. The <a href=""https://dpaw.sharepoint.com/teams/RiversandEstuariesScience/Tools%20and%20Technologies/Oxygenation%20modelling/1_Admin%20&amp;%20Correspondence/bom.gov.au/state-of-climate"">seventh biennial State of Climate report</a> (bom.gov.au/state-of-climate) reported, since 1910 Australia&rsquo;s climate has warmed by an average of 1.47<u>+</u>0.24<sup>o</sup>C, and since 1970 in southwest of Australia a decline rainfall approx. 15% in April to October and 19% in May to July, leading to a significant decrease in streamflow.</p>
<p>There are plausible adverse impacts of this climate change on the current oxygenation operation in the upper Swan River estuary and these need to be investigated to proactively define the necessary adaptation approach for oxygenation over the coming decade.</p>","<p>The project will contribute to improve oxygenation approaches in the Swan River estuary by developing better understandings of variability and drivers of oxygen conditions. This will be achieved through application of the 3D hydrodynamic oxygen predictive model, namely the Swan Canning Estuarine Response Model (SCERM) to address the specific aims:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understanding of the impact of seasonal variations of the estuary conditions on the extent of the oxygenation plant generated plumes.</li>
<li>Understanding how salt wedge dynamics influence oxygen distribution.</li>
<li>Understanding the influence of the catchment inflow water quantity and quality.</li>
<li>Assessment on possible improvement of the oxygenation plants efficiency by changing the current diffuser locations and flow-rate.</li>
<li>Assessment on the need to alter the oxygenation plants capacity as a response to climate change scenario 2030, i.e., increase in air temperature, ocean acidification, less rainfall.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>","<p>The project will provide key understandings on the Swan River estuary&rsquo;s hydrodynamic (water level, temperature and salinity) and oxygen dynamic based on 5-years (2018-2023) validated oxygen model, which will assist the oxygenation plants managers in optimizing the plants operation and adaptation of climate change impact on the operation.&nbsp;</p>","<p>During the life of the project, reference group meetings are scheduled every 6 weeks. At the meeting, the project leader presents the project progress and discusses any issues that arise with reference/experts, project team members and stakeholders which include the oxygenation team in Rivers and Estuaries Branch (REB). This forms an on-going knowledge transfer process. Additional meetings and discussions will be organized as required.</p>
<p>The project leader will work with managers during the project to enable their input of data supporting model validation. In addition managers will be able to input their expertise in oxygenation management into scenario development (Aims 4 &amp; 5).</p>
<p>The project leader will also provide some additional educational material (in the form of a presentation) to support learnings of managers / junior scientists in model frameworks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the project, knowledge gained will be conveyed to the oxygenation team in Rivers and Estuaries Branch of the Conservation and Ecosystem Management Division and other relevant teams in Rivers and Estuaries Science (RES).&nbsp;</p>","<p>Deliverables and time frames:</p>

<p><strong>Aim 1: Understanding of the impact of seasonal variations of the estuary conditions on the extent of the oxygenation plant generated plumes</strong>, and <strong>Aim 2:</strong> &nbsp;<strong>how salt wedge dynamics influence oxygen distribution</strong>.</p>
<p>The Swan Canning Estuarine Response Model (SCERM) developed by the UWA-AED group (Paraska, <em>et al</em>. 2022) in collaboration with DBCA will be modified to suit the purpose of this project. Modifications to the original SCERM (with 44 catchment inflows; hence it&rsquo;s called SCERM44) will include a more localised model domain (spanning from the upper reach/Yagan Bridge in Belhus to the Narrows in Perth), 2D meteorological forcing, and 29 inflows from the contributing catchments; herewith is called SCERM29.</p>
<p>The SCERM29 will require calibration and validation processes using data collected by the oxygenation team in Rivers and Estuaries Branch of the Conservation and Ecosystem Management Division and estuarine monitoring by the Rivers and Estuaries Science (RES) team.</p>
<p>Detailed steps required to achieve Aims 1 and 2 include the model setup, calibration and validation described below.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The SCERM29 setup</li>
</ol>
<p>The SCERM29 consists of a 3D flexible-mesh (finite volume) utilizing the TUFLOW-FV (TFV) hydrodynamic driver and TFV Water Quality Oxygen module. TFV accounts for variations in water level, horizontal salinity distribution and vertical density stratification in response to tides, inflows, salt-wedge dynamics and surface thermodynamics. The mesh consists of triangular and quadrilateral elements of different size that are suited to simulating areas of complex estuarine morphometry. The finite volume numerical scheme solves the conservative integral form of the nonlinear shallow water equations in addition to the advection and transport of scalar constituents such as salinity and temperature as well as dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration.</p>
<p>Boundary condition inputs to the model include:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
<li>2D (horizontal grids) initial condition, values are extracted from monitoring data. &nbsp;</li>
<li>2D (vertical grids) hourly inflow at Narrows, values are extracted from SCERM44 model output for the same simulation period.</li>
<li>1D daily 29 inflows (flow, temperature, salinity and DO), values are the output of the Swan Canning Catchment Model (SCCM) simulated using eWater Source for the same simulation period.</li>
<li>2D (horizontal grids) hourly meteorological fluxes: air temperature, air humidity, wind components (u component, parallel to x-axis and v component, parallel to y-axis) are calculated from gridded data of wind speed and direction, incoming shortwave and longwave radiation, and rainfall. Data (1.5km grid) are extracted from Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (<a href=""https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog.html"">https://dapds00.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog.html</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Parameters input to the model will be applied from the results of calibration process.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>The SCCM setup</li>
</ol>
<p>SCCM domain and parameterizations (including runoff parameters) utilized in the SCCM for this project are derived from Paraska, <em>et al</em>. (2022). The eWater Source version 5.20 will be used for this project, instead of the older version Source 4.9 utilized in Paraska, et al. (2022).&nbsp;Rainfall and evaporation data inputs for SCCM are from SILO Australian climate data (<a href=""https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/"">https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/</a>).</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Model validations and assessments</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparisons between simulated and measured state variables (water level, temperature, salinity and DO) will be presented using time-series plots, vertical profiles, 2D horizontal contours, 2D curtain contours, and animation.</p>
<p>To understand the impact of seasonal (summer, autumn, winter and spring) variations of the estuary conditions on the extent of the oxygenation plumes, and salt wedge dynamics influence on oxygen distribution, the following will be presented:</p>
<p>3a. Time-series plots: seasonal comparison of bottom water DO comparison and percentage of bottom area under hypoxia and low DO in the oxygenation target zone.</p>
<p>3b. Contour plots: comparison of the oxygenation distribution in each season for each year simulation.</p>
<p>3c. Calculation of the exceedance of probability of benthic water experiencing hypoxia and low DO for each season.</p>
<p>3d. Time-series overlay plots of DO, salinity stratification, total hypoxia and low DO area, each at surface and bottom layer.</p>
<p>3e. Time-series overlay plots of DO (surface layer-average) and salt-wedge intrusion variation, from Narrows upstream.</p>
<p>3f. Vertical profiles (seasonally averaged) current speeds at same locations around oxygenation diffusers.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 3: Understanding the influence of the catchment inflow water quantity and quality</strong>.</p>
<p>The relationship between inflow water quality and estuarine water quality is complex. Hence the assessment will be based on the sensitivity analysis on the 29 inflows water quality on the calibrated and validated models, to gain insights the most critical catchments outflows on the estuarine oxygen dynamics. When applicable, multi-variate statistical analysis will be applied to evaluate different inflow effects.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 4: Assessment on possible improvement of the oxygenation plants efficiency by changing the current diffuser/sparger locations and flowrate</strong>.</p>
<p>Assessment methods described in items 3d to 3f will be utilised.</p>
<p><strong>Aim 5: Assessment on the need to alter oxygenation plants capacity as a response to climate change scenario 2030, i.e., increase in air temperature, increase in ocean-driven tide levels, ocean acidification and less rainfall.&nbsp;<u></u></strong></p>
<p>2D boundary conditions meteorological inputs derived from Western Australia future climate produced by Climate Science Initiative will be utilised. The 4km grids datasets are expected to be ready in 2024, accessible via DWER Platform.</p>
<p>Assessment methods described in items 3a to 3f will be utilised to inform the resulting changes in oxygen dynamic. When applicable, metrics such as R<sup>2</sup> (coefficient determination), RMSE (root mean square standard error), and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) will be utilized.</p>
