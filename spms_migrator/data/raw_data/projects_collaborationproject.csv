<p>To survey and contrast the biodiversity values of a large semi-rural nature reserve and a large urban bushland with similar dominant overstorey vegetation (Banksia woodland). This will contribute to an understanding how much biodiversity has been retained in the urban setting as a result of historical and current management, acknowledging that the 'natural' area is not undisturbed.</p>

<p>To contribute to a project that aims to characterise global patterns in biodiversity distribution, contrast urban and natural areas and to upscale emerging technologies for biodiversity survey.</p>
<p>To gain an insight into the application and effectiveness of efficient biodiversity survey methods</p>
</div>","<div class=""tinymce-wrap"">
<p>Terrestrial biodiversity conservation is informed by data on species and communities at a range of scales. Traditional methods of biodiversity survey can be time consuming, limiting the sampling effort and geographic scale of surveys and monitoring projects. Newer technologies and analytical methods are likely to be part of the solution to providing biodiversity data at more comprehensive spatial and temporal scales. Some of these are already being used, e.g. cameras, but generate a large amount of data that, at present, has to be manually interpreted. This project, funded by the European Research Council, aims to develop the use of these newer technologies and employ them at a large scale by developing the 'big data' automated analytical technology.</p>
<p>Lifeplan will use audio recorders, camera traps, spore and pollen sampling, soil fungal sampling and insect trapping to measure multiple biotic elements at 200 sites, including 100 global sites spread across all continents and then more intensive sampling (including a nested sampling project) in Scandinavia and Madagascar. Machine learning/artificial intelligence will be used with the audio recordings and camera trap images (using locally provided training datasets), while the insect, spore/pollen and soil samples will be analysed using genetic methods.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this project is that each of the 100 global sites will consist of a pair of sites, one 'natural' and one 'urban' to investigate the responses of biodiversity to urbanisation. The Perth site is one of two in Australia and will be conducted at Lowlands Nature Reserve (the natural site) and at Kings Park (the urban site).</p>

This will in turn facilitate the development of techniques to evaluate&nbsp;individual variation in male fertility and better define puberty and senescence. The development of an index of male fertility will allow staff at Perth Zoo to determine if there is a male factor influencing reproductive success in the captive breeding programs. Previously the presence of sperm in voided urine was assumed to confirm fertility in the male prior to the introduction of the female for breeding purposes. If sperm production is too low or if a male has a high proportion of sperm abnormalities, his fertility may be compromised. Improving the evaluation methods of sperm production in these species may improve captive breeding success by prioritizing males with a minimal standard of sperm numbers and quality and facilitate the evaluation of young and old males for their potential to contribute to the captive breeding program. Improvements in captive breeding success, will enhance the zoo's contribution to the recovery programs and the species conservation.</p>
<p>Breeding success of Numbats at Perth Zoo has been variable over time and sub-optimal overall. Over the last five years, an average of 56% of females paired were confirmed with pouch young during the first pouch check shortly after birth. Currently we are unsure which factors are responsible for reduced captive breeding success in this species.</p>
<p>In the captive breeding program for Dibblers, an average of 85% of females paired produce pouch young, an excellent overall result. Despite this, our understanding of male Dibbler reproductive biology is still quite basic and senescence and individual variability has yet to be quantified.</p>"

However, where available, temperature archives only date back as far as the instrumental record (mid-19<sup>th</sup> century onwards). Coral skeletons can be utilised to create high-resolution reconstructions of past temperature that can track back hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of years (e.g. fossil corals) and can thus help to fill these observational gaps. They are the most commonly used high‐resolution temperature proxy in the tropical oceans, providing paleoclimate reconstructions dating back centuries to millennia. However, physiological differences in skeletal formation modes together with artifacts arising from coral biomineralization (vital effects) can confound the temperature dependence of single element‐to‐calcium ratios. In efforts to reduce vital effects and isolate temperature, new approaches have been developed based on Sr‐U and Li/Mg, which combine Sr/Ca and U/Ca and Li/Ca and Mg/Ca, respectively. While much work has been done to understand the functioning of these temperature proxies in naturally growing corals in the field, less has been done to validate and calibrate them under controlled aquaria conditions. The aims of this project are to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate the response of coral thermometry under constant controlled conditions and seasonally variable temperature and light regimes.</li>
<li>Establish a validation and calibration of coral skeletal trace element temperature proxies for corals grown under controlled aquaria conditions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Quantify the influence of coral physiological 'vital effects' on the calibration of coral-based trace element temperature proxies.</li>

Spinifex hummock grass communities are widespread throughout arid and semi-arid Australia and dominate in many landscapes. Many spinifexes are ecological keystone species, driving landscape-scale processes such as fire regimes, nutrient cycling, and providing critical habitat for a wide range of fauna including many threatened species. Consequently they are key restoration and rehabilitation targets throughout arid and semi-arid Australia, however establishment of <em>Triodia</em> is often difficult and patchy. Despite its importance, the taxonomy of <em>Triodia</em> has been poorly understood, and relatively little study of genetic diversity has been carried out, especially at the intraspecific level. Ill-defined species names prevent accurate substrate matching and selection of appropriate genetic resources for a particular area. This project aims to clarify species boundaries, understand genetic relationships and biogeographic structure between species, and evaluate genetic partitioning within species, and then evaluate substrate specificity and adaptation to improve seed sourcing and habitat matching guidelines for restoration.</p>
<p>The project has greatly improved our understanding of genetic and taxonomic diversity in the genus, with 16 new species described or in press, and at least 30 more species descriptions in preparation. The final tally of Triodia species is expected to be at least 120 species, making it Australia's largest grass genus. A revision of the <em>Triodia basedowii</em> complex has been published (Anderson et al 2017), and an interactive key (SPIKEY, Barrett et al 2017) to 29 taxa of Pilbara <em>Trioidia</em> is now available free.</p>
<p>A particular focus of the project is mapping ploidy (whole-genome duplication resulting in multiple copies of each chromosome, e.g. 2n=36 diploids vs 2n=72 tetraploids). A key discovery of this project has been the prevalence of substantially segregated ploidy races within many species of <em>Triodia,</em> an aspect never before studied in the genus. Since ploidy types strongly segregate in the wild, it is likely that they will do so in mixed rehabilitated sites, with a potential lowering of reproductive ability of both types in the artificial population. We are continuing to map and assess the potential for ploidy mixing with current seed collection strategies, and evaluate strategies to reduce the risks to long-term sustainability of rehabilitated <em>Triodia</em> populations.</p>

Baits for feral cats must be laid on the surface and this presents a potential hazard for non-target wildlife species.

The proposed study uses methods employed successfully with other turtle species to bridge this outstanding information gap on flatback turtles for the first time. DBCA initiated a large collection of skeletal material of juvenile and adult specimens from all major AUS museums, collaborators, and freshly collected specimens. All specimens were exported under CITES permits to NMFS labs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal links to work conducted in two NMFS labs. The NMFS Beaufort labs (Dr. Larissa Avens) process turtle bones in the skeletochronology lab and the work in progress is expected to reveal ages and first growth curves for flatback turtles. The Beaufort-processed specimens are to be transferred to the NMFS San Diego labs (Dr. Jeffrey Seminoff, Dr. Cali Turner) for a follow-up stable isotope study. The growth layers identified by skeletochronology are subject to microdrilling to obtain samples for a stable isotope study.&nbsp; A study of growth layer sequence will reveal carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures that illustrate changing diet compositions with growth in size and shifts of habitat.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Dr. Cali Turner was contracted for 2020-2022.&nbsp; Deliverables included an invited seminar at the 40th International Sea Turtle Society, an article for general public, a referred Paper in Public Library of Science and a supervised student project in 2023 to conplete the isotope collaboration</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Ontogenetic changes in resource use often delimit transitions between life stages. Ecological and individual factors can cause variation in the timing and consistency of these transitions, ultimately affecting community and population dynamics through changes in growth and survival. Therefore, it is important to document and understand behavioral and life history polymorphisms, and the processes that drive intraspecific variation in them. To evaluate juvenile and adult flatback turtle life history variation and to detect shifts in habitat and diet that occur during ontogenetic shifts, we will sequentially analyze the stable isotope composition of humerus bone growth increments from turtles that stranded dead on Australian coasts (n = 70). &nbsp;These data will provide a new line of evidence whether juvenile flatbacks exhibit a major ontogenetic shift pattern or remain in nearshore developmental habitats. A difference in isotopic baselines between juvenile and adult stages would hypothetically be driven by a coupled change in both habitat and diet, and that facultative shifters utilize both neritic and oceanic resources within transitional growth years. &nbsp;The results will expand our understanding of flatback sea turtle life history polymorphisms and demonstrate the value of bone tissue analysis to the study of this variation. Sequential analysis of annual skeletal growth increments provides a valuable method for reconstructing long-term ontogenetic changes in foraging ecology and habitat use in long-lived, cryptic marine species.</p>

It is used to estimate population growth rates; potential future growth rates; and in combination with kin-recognition, it significantly improves population size estimates (see Bravington et al. 2016). Yet, most animals lack a reliable and easy to measure indicator of age. This adds significant uncertainty and risk into estimates of population viability in wildlife and estimates of optimal harvest rates in fisheries.<br />Changes in DNA methylation levels has recently been used to estimate the age of animals (Jarman et al., 2015). This has been demonstrated in a range of human assays (see de Paoli-Iseppi et al., 2017), has had limited testing on mice (Maegawa et al., 2010) and monkeys (Horvath 2013) and has so far only been applied to one wild animal species, humpback whales (Polanoswki et al., 2014). There is still extensive technical and theoretical work to be done to streamline the development of epigenetic age assays for new species and to understand how the estimates can be used, but there are clear paths to doing this (de Paoli-Iseppi et al., 2017).<br />The field of epigenetic age estimation is very new and each assay is a bespoke creation for the target species, so development costs are currently high. Technical developments and deeper theoretical understanding of the epigenetic changes associates with regulated and damage-based ageing processes will reduce costs, increase the efficiency of assays, and potentially point to more universal assay targets. Rapid non-invasive ageing assays have the potential to significantly impact many aspects of fisheries and wildlife management. We are seeking a postdoctoral scientist to join the Environomics Future Science Platform and to undertake important developmental work in this exciting frontier of applied science.</p>

</ul>","<p>Conservation of marine ecosystems depends on an integrated understanding of the trophic relationships between key habitats and associated wildlife. As a primary producer, seagrasses are&nbsp;a cornerstone for trophic relationships and a critically important&nbsp;habitat for many marine species, including iconic large herbivores such as dugongs. Seagrass meadows are vulnerable to disturbance, yet there is a profound lack of information on their distribution across the Pilbara, and almost no understanding of the how they change naturally or in response to human&nbsp;perturbations,&nbsp;or of the consequences of these changes for the species that rely on them. Given the increasing pressures on these habitats from industry growth in the Pilbara and from global warming, this is a critical information gap that limits our capacity to plan and manage for long-term conservation of seagrass and iconic marine fauna. This gap results from a combination of factors: the absence of baseline mapping and assessment of seagrass condition, and an established seagrass habitat monitoring framework; limited understanding of the distribution and movement patterns of large herbivores in response to available resources; and the lack of integrated approaches that can relate habitat condition to wildlife use and condition. We will address this through a collaborative, multi-institutional project that will establish the natural dynamics of seagrass habitat across the Pilbara, and measure how this influences distribution and habitat use of dugong at a local scale.&nbsp;The outcome will be the creation of a seagrass habitat and marine wildlife monitoring framework, including best practice protocols, indicators and sites, that will underpin informed management for the Pilbara and more broadly across WA. This management outcome will be enhanced through a knowledge transfer plan embedded in the project, built on the participation of research end-users in the project and a series of targeted science-stakeholder exchange processes.</p>

While much of the monitoring focus commonly lays in shallower water areas accessible to methods utilsing in-water SCUBA divers, there is an acknowledgement that surveys of deeper water assemblages, beyond the limits of safe/feasible diving operations, must also be incorporated into any comprehensive program. Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video (stereo-BRUV) has previously been utilised as a part of WAMMP's fish community monitoring program in other regions and is an effective way of surveying in deeper waters, beyond the reach of conventional diver based methods. The proposed study will extend the use of this method into the Ningaloo Marine Park, in deeper waters (50-70m) outside of the lagoonal area.&nbsp;</p>"

<p>The DBCA Marine Monitoring Program assesses the condition of key ecological values in WA&rsquo;s marine reserves with respect to a range of pressures. Long term data collected regarding key ecological assets is used to infer the success of existing management and to ensure it remains effective. The Marine Monitoring Program has established long-term seagrass monitoring in Ngari Capes Marine Park in collaboration with ECU and DWER in addition to developing additional monitoring of other key ecological values in the marine park.</p>
<p>The existing seagrass monitoring program collects data on seagrass shoot density at 17 sites in Geographe Bay as well as canopy height and percent cover. These indicators provide an efficient and robust method for quantifying the health of the seagrass habitat at the individual site level and provide an acute indication of the impact of various stressors. Loss of shoot density is a sensitive indicator of deteriorating condition and so provides an effective early warning of change.</p>
<p>Total seagrass cover is not captured by these methods and so loss of seagrass cover away from monitoring sites and changes in the total area of seagrass habitat are not known. High resolution satellite imagery can provide an accurate representation of seagrass habitat extent which in conjunction with ground truthing imagery and GIS software facilitate the production of a detailed habitat map. The differentiation of seagrass, macroalgae, sand and reef habitat will enable the total area of seagrass to be determined. The additional ground truthing data, shoot density information and canopy height, mean that biomass and volume can also be determined and in turn provides in indication of sequestered carbon content. The resultant data provide a crucial benchmark against which the system can be monitored and compared at intervals in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This study found relationships between the division or genera of algae and specific human disturbances that were not detectable when pooling taxa into a single functional category, which is common to many analyses.

<li>Are the Felixers sufficiently target specific (i.e. not recognising other species, particularly threatened species such as northern quolls, as targets)?</li>
<li>Are they effective at reducing cat numbers?</li>
<li>Does this translate into a positive effect on native species&nbsp;(primarily focusing on the endangered northern quoll)?</li>
</ul>","<p>Predation by feral cats is a primary threat to more than 100 species of native Australian animals, including mammals, reptiles and ground-dwelling bird species. Control of feral cats is difficult due to their preference to hunting live prey rather than accepting baits, their cryptic and nocturnal behaviour, and their ability to persist in almost every habitat across the continent.</p>
<p>Ecological Horizons Pty Ltd are developing an automated Feral Cat Grooming Trap (the &ldquo;Felixer&rdquo;) as a potential new tool for feral cat management. The unit detects the presence of a feral cat and sprays a lethal dose (8mg) of 1080 toxic gel onto the fur of the feral cat from up to four metres away. The feral cat instinctively grooms itself to remove the gel and in doing so ingests a lethal dose of the poison. The Felixer is capable of discharging 20 times (utilising 20 separate, measured dose cartridges) before the internal magazine needs to be reloaded with new cartridges. The unit takes a photograph every time the detection beams are crossed, allowing managers to assess the efficacy of the trap in differentiating feral cats from non-target species and also allowing Felixers to be used as stand alone, solar powered camera traps. This new technology is being trialled Australia-wide, with more than 50 units deployed in different environments, initially with non-toxic cartridges. Northern quolls were identified as a potentially problematic non-target issue for using Felixers to control feral cats in Western Australia due to their cat-like shape, and vulnerability to doses of 1080. In collaboration with Roy Hill and FMG, DBCA have been trialling three Felixer units in the Pilbara to determine their safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>If found to be efficient and effective, this automated unit provides a promising method for targeted feral cat control at specific localities. Situations such as: high-value threatened species populations in limited areas (such as night parrot populations), locations that have a predator &ldquo;sink&rdquo; (such as on the outside of predator exclosures), or in locations where cats travel through limited areas (such as peninsulas or islands). The units have low maintenance requirements, which is particularly helpful in remote regions. Data on the efficacy of these units will be critical to the ongoing development of affordable and effective feral cat control in Australia.</p>
<p>Proper testing of this new technology is essential for validating the Felixer as an effective and low-risk feral cat management tool and eventually securing APVMA approvals for non-research deployments. False targeting of native non-target species would be a critical error for conservation measures and require optimisation of detection algorithms or potentially redesign.</p>"

While the accuracy of known identified sandalwood stems in the classification was high (&gt;0.8) there are also an excessive number of false positives, with over 1500 sandalwood predicted in an area known to have only 257. The main factor causing the high number of false positives is the small proportion of sandalwood in the population (257 in an area with ~ 9000 plants). This small proportion means that even if a model has a small percentage error the number of false positives will be greater than the number of sandalwood.</p>
<p>In terms of model performance, the best classification was achieved using eCognition 9.5 software and implementing a watershed segmentation, at a scale of 5 on a smoothed 0.25 m green leaf algorithm image. This method appears to optimally smooth within crown variability while maintaining between crown definition. While this was judged to be the optimal model many other options performed comparably.</p>
<p>The 0.25 m imagery pixel size appeared to be an optimal resolution for the task, the 0.05 m data did not produce better results. The normalized surface model (NSM) was rated as the most influential variable in the modelling process. However, a comparison of sandalwood NSM heights and field height measures highlighted that the NSM dataset contains significant errors. These errors are likely to impact the classification accuracy.</p>"

However, reefs are rapidly degrading due to climate-induced disturbance events and a backdrop of chronic stress (e.g. overfishing, increased nutrient loads). With reefs still recovering from the most prolonged global coral die-off on record (2015-2016), taking up the gauntlet of disentangling the individual effects of multiple stressors is a necessary step to help managers and conservation practitioners making decisions in a context of high uncertainty. This would require a set of complementary indicators evaluating the multi-faceted status of reefs in both terms of taxonomic and functional diversity. Such indicators should be built using large-scale and long-term datasets to capture a wide range of environmental, biogeographical and anthropogenic conditions. In SCORE-REEF, we will aim for this, by merging global-scale spatial databases on coral reef benthic and fish assemblages and long-term datasets derived from monitoring programs running in the French Territories (French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Mayotte, Reunion Island, Eparses Islands, Martinique and Guadeloupe) and other regions (Hawaii, 43 Pacific islands, 18 sites in the South Western Indian Ocean, 91 sites in the Caribbean. Western Australia). We will: i) evaluate the quality, relevance and the consistency of available datasets and systematically evaluate existing indicators; ii) assess the temporal dynamics of coral reef benthic and fish assemblages using taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic approaches to define ecoregions; iii) develop region-specific indicators of coral reef health and resilience accounting for both taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic facets of biodiversity with regard to human impacts and to environmental variability; iv) test for the relevance and temporal stability of indicators used within the context of the European Water Framework Directive, GCRMN and MPA monitoring; v). We also plan to directly meet managers and stakeholders (representing MPAs, IFRECOR and WFD) during the project to jointly evaluate environmental policies and propose co-defined indicators and metrics.&nbsp;</p>

Ecological and individual factors can cause variation in the timing and consistency of these transitions, ultimately affecting community and population dynamics through changes in growth and survival. Therefore, it is important to document and understand behavioral and life history polymorphisms, and the processes that drive intraspecific variation in them. To evaluate juvenile and adult flatback turtle life history variation and to detect shifts in habitat and diet that occur during ontogenetic shifts, we will sequentially analyze the stable isotope composition of bulk skin tissue from nesting of inwater turtles in WA. These data will provide a new line of evidence whether juvenile turtles exhibit a major ontogenetic shift pattern or remain in nearshore developmental habitats. A difference in isotopic baselines between juvenile and adult stages would hypothetically be driven by a coupled change in both habitat and diet, and that facultative shifters utilize both neritic and oceanic resources within transitional growth years. &nbsp;The results will expand our understanding of sea turtle life history polymorphisms and demonstrate the value of bone tissue analysis to the study of this variation.

This project includes five activities (two of which are exclusive to WA) that will contribute to addressing key knowledge gaps about the spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution, abundance, connectivity and health of dugong populations. The project is designed to inform management in several regions of high value habitat across northern Australia. Transversal to the activities described below is a strong partnership approach with Traditional Owners and members of the wider community. The project will be co-designed, co-produced and will co-deliver research and monitoring outputs. The studies will utilise and advance emerging technologies (e.g., aerial images collected from planes and drones, Artificial Intelligence, population genomics) with the ultimate goal of enhancing data quality, reducing research and monitoring costs, and increasing accessibility of monitoring tools to non-experts.</p>
<p>the five activiteis are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assessing trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery surveys along the eastern coast of Queensland</li>
<li>Assessing the trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery survey in the Shark Bay and Ningaloo/Exmouth Gulf area</li>
<li>Using population genomics approaches to identify populations and their level of connectivity across northern Australia</li>
<li>Assessing the body size and body condition of dugongs using drone-based photogramme</li>
<li>Developing community-led dugong monitoring with traditional owners in the Kimberley region.</li>
</ol>
<p>Activities 2 and 5 are exclusive to WA and led by the Marine Science Program with collaborators in the respective regions and at JCU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Activity 2 we will be conducting an aerial survey of Shark Bay through to Exmouth Gulf to assess the abundance and distribution of dugong as part of a long term data series.&nbsp; Nationally, a federal Transition Strategy is being developed to guide the transition from traditional observer surveys to aerial imagery surveys, as it is recognised that imagery surveys have the potential to improve data quality and accuracy and to minimise human risk. We will undertake the 2023 aerial survey using methods that will inform, and be a step in this transition, including using a combined platform approach (imagery and observers) for the survey and working with ECU to furhter develop AI techniques to process the imagery. Joint management partners will be involved in the survey design and implementation.</p>
<p>Activity 5 will focus on working with the indigenous Salwtatere Advisory Group of the Kimberley to identify specific priorities under their <em>Kimberley Indigenous Turtle &amp; Dugong Initiative 2022&ndash;2032 </em>that may be implemented under this project, namely exploration and training in the use of drones to monitor dugong.&nbsp;</p>"

Our approach is applied to spatial and genetic datasets assembled for 13 small-medium sized mammal species, including four that are endangered nationally, in the multi-use landscape of the Pilbara bioregion that is a resource-rich Australian biodiversity hotspot. A key outcome is to identify strategic landscape-scale conservation priorities for habitat protection and threat management via systematic conservation planning (SCP). This project is significant in advancing new methodologies to incorporate connectivity modelling into multi-species conservation planning, identifying the major factors contributing to species landscape use and providing a framework for prioritising evolutionary resilient landscapes that can be applied to conservation management in multi-use landscapes globally. We address our aims through the following objectives:</p>
<p>[1] Locate core habitat (refuges) and connectivity pathways (corridors) for species and species&rsquo; guilds under current environmental conditions by modelling habitat suitability and contemporary gene flow;</p>
<p>[2] Locate key areas for persistence under changing climates by inferring locations of evolutionary refugia from population genomic data and spatial modelling of range dynamics under historical and predicted future environments; and</p>
<p>[3] Using SCP, identify cost-effective conservation strategies to enhance and protect these areas for optimal combinations of threatened and other species or species&rsquo; guilds.</p>","<p>Identifying and protecting refugia and habitat corridors is the cornerstone of best-practice conservation in multi-use landscapes. Globally, the conservation community is recognising that a static, fragmented protected area system is, in many cases, inadequate to conserve populations and species in large areas, over long time-scales and given current rates of environmental change [1,2]. This recognition has motivated a paradigm shift in conservation thinking away from managing species at a local scale to a broader spatial and temporal perspective: managing species and ecological processes at a whole-of-landscape scale [3] and incorporating evolutionary processes to build species&rsquo; capacity for adaptation to environmental change [4].</p>
<p>There are two key foci in this species&rsquo; resilience conservation approach: (i) protecting refugia, areas of the landscape that offer temporally stable, climatically buffered habitat that species can retreat to, persist in and expand from under changing environmental conditions, and which represent potential reservoirs of genetic diversity for adaptation to change [5&ndash;8]; and (ii) promoting population connectivity to maintain metapopulation viability and to retain species&rsquo; evolutionary potential [4,9].</p>
<p>Frameworks exist for the identification of refugia [7] and their incorporation into conservation planning including Australian examples [10,11]. Efforts to characterise landscape connectivity, however, are frequently hampered by the lack of empirical data on species dispersal with which to inform mechanistic models [12]. Emerging landscape genetics approaches that quantify gene flow as a proxy for realised dispersal to assess landscape connectivity hold promise to infer dispersal corridors, but to date there has been little uptake in conservation planning, both here and internationally [13]. Single-species case studies are available [14,15], however, to be useful as a landscape-scale conservation prioritisation tool, connectivity expectations across a range of species with different movement characteristics and/or habitat requirements is required for robust conservation decision-making [14]. Characterisation of the major modes of dispersal for different species types (guilds) and the landscape features that modify or promote connectivity is critical information for landscape-scale conservation planning. Further, in much the same way that the spatio-temporal stability of refugia are assessed, the stability of species&rsquo; dispersal corridors should be evaluated under past, present and predicted future environmental conditions to inform crucial dispersal routes. Application of a spatio-temporal landscape genetics approach to multi-species conservation planning therefore represents a novel and significant advancement in this field, both nationally and internationally, and provides a means to move beyond a simple pattern- to process-based approach to species conservation [1,4,13].</p>
<p>The Pilbara biogeographic region in arid north-west Western Australia (WA) is one of the oldest landscapes on earth [16] and provides an excellent case study with which to demonstrate the application of this innovative approach. The Pilbara has a unique and incredibly rich biodiversity [16], and due to its vast mineral reserves, is also a critical source of income for the Australian economy, contributing 80% of WA&rsquo;s $103 billion mineral and petroleum industry [17]. The rapid pace of resource development in the Pilbara has generated conflict between the State&rsquo;s desire to support economic development whilst also upholding its responsibilities to protect biodiversity and environmental values as required by Federal (Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act) and State legislation. The WA Government&rsquo;s recently released Pilbara Conservation Strategy identifies that a landscape-scale, coordinated approach to development and biodiversity conservation is critical to ensure sustainable outcomes for government, industry and the environment. This project is therefore significant in bringing together key government and industry stakeholders actively engaged in conservation management in the Pilbara bioregion to identify priority conservation management areas for the small-medium sized mammal fauna, including four EPBC-listed threatened species (northern quoll, bilby, ghost bat, Pilbara leaf-nosed bat). These &lsquo;critical weight range&rsquo; mammals are recognised as being the most &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; to human-associated disturbances [18].</p>

Here we modelled the probability of occurrence of six endemic fish species using two remote underwater stereo-video sampling methods (i.e. baited and towed video). Models developed for the towed stereo-video method had consistently better predictive performance for all but one of the study species. These models often incorporated small-scale measures of habitat complexity and were more likely to reflect true species-habitat relationships. Conversely, models based on baited video dataset regularly included large-scale measures of structural complexity, suggesting fish attraction to a single focus point by bait. The lower cost associated with use of the towed video systems for surveying low-relief seascapes provides additional support for considering this method for developing species distribution models and marine spatial management purposes.</p>"

<p>&nbsp;</p>","<p>The DBCA Marine Monitoring Program assesses the condition of key ecological values in WA&rsquo;s marine reserves relative to human and natural pressures. The program relies on long-term data and a robust sampling design to distinguish human impacts from natural variation in the environment. The methods typically employed for collecting monitoring data have been used for several decades and collating information from multiple sources can provide an insight into how the condition of ecological values has changed over that time. However, monitoring often commences in marine reserves that have already been subject to pressures like fishing for a long time and key ecological communities like fishes are already altered. As such, our perception of a pristine environment, condition baselines and the influence of humans is often based on the earliest collections of empirical information.</p>

</ul>","<p>Aerial line-transect surveys are used around the world for estimating the abundance of marine mammals to inform conservation and management strategies. However, accurate and informative estimates of abundance rely on accurate estimates of the proportion of time animals are visible to the aerial observers (availability bias). Existing methods of estimating this bias have many limitations and don&rsquo;t necessarily reflect true availability. We will develop methods for using small, vessel-launched UAVs to conduct aerial observations of coastal dolphins and directly record availability. The methodology will initially be developed through several days of field trials targeting Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (<em>Tursiops </em>aduncus) in WA state waters adjacent to Perth and/or Mandurah. We will then focus on Australian humpback dolphins (<em>Sousa sahulensis</em>) off north-western Australia, a priority species in an area of increasing coastal development. Our results will directly feed into the&nbsp; Department ofBiodiversity, Conservation and Attractions'&nbsp;program of aerial surveys of coastal dolphins off the Pilbara coast, while the methods we develop will be broadly applicable to other species.

<li>To determine the genomic basis for thermal-tolerance in Kimberley corals, and combine this with other newly developed genomic resources for corals to develop a DNA-based toolkit for understanding and managing coral communities.</li>
</ul>","<p>Coral reef ecosystems of the Kimberley (<em>wooddooroo</em>) have been described as some of the least impacted in the world due to their resilient biology, and the low level of local anthropogenic pressures (Halpern et al., 2008). The Kimberley intertidal <em>wooddooroo</em>&nbsp;host a diverse assemblage of marine life, including over 225 species of coral (Richards et al., 2015; 2018). Kimberley <em>wooddooroo</em> are an important cultural asset for Traditional Owners such as the Dambimangari, Mayala and Bardi Jawa while also providing food and habitat for a range of similarly-important fish, crustacea and molluscs. Kimberley <em>wooddooroo</em> appear especially hardy, as they have successfully adapted to environmental extremes such as extreme temperatures and desiccation during the large local macrotides (11+ m during spring waters) (Richards et al., 2015).</p>
<p>W<em>ooddooroo</em> found in the broader Kimberley and within the Lalang-garram Marine Parks are widely recognised as a significant ecological and cultural asset. Recognition of the importance of these <em>wooddooroo&nbsp;</em>habitats was one of the key drivers for creation of the Lalang-garram Marine Parks network within the Dambimangari Native Title area. However, while Kimberley intertidal <em>wooddooroo&nbsp;</em>are currently healthy, they are not exempt from threats by climate change and outbreaks of predators, disease and invasive species which threaten other nearshore intertidal coral reefs around the world (Hughes et al., 2017; Richards et al., 2018). Hence, <em>wooddooroo</em> have been recognised as a DBCA monitoring priority in all Marine Parks within the Kimberley IMCRA bioregion (Halford and Kendrick, 2017).</p>
<p>To allow appropriate monitoring of intertidal Kimberley <em>wooddooroo</em>, it is important to firstly build up our knowledge of their diversity. Benthic community composition, level of <em>wooddooroo</em> cover, and distribution are key performance indicators (KPI) identified in Lalang-garram Marine Park Management Plans. This project will build baseline data to enable reporting on these KPIs, and will further examine the genomics of Kimberley <em>wooddooroo.</em></p>"

Corals are the primary framework builders, calcifying rapidly in three dimensions, while CCA bind the reef framework, providing substrate for coral settlement and stabilisation. While much work has been done to understand the contribution of corals to carbonate budgets, relatively little is known about the contribution of CCA. Furthermore, ongoing declines in coral cover due to a range of environmental perturbations may influence the relative importance of CCA and other non-scleractinian calcifying taxa to coral reef carbonate production.&nbsp;This project show that CCA are important carbonate producers that, under certain conditions, can match or even exceed the contribution of corals to coral reef carbonate production. Despite their importance, CCA are often inaccurately recorded in benthic surveys or even entirely missing from coral reef carbonate budgets. The project outlines several recommendations to improve the inclusion of CCA into such carbonate budgets under the ongoing climate crisis.

<p>To explore the influence of large scale climatic conditions and smaller scale habitat measures on temporal and spatial patterns of recruitment</p>
<p>To&nbsp;assess the influence of recruitment, habitat and post recruitment processes on fish populations</p>","<p>Recruitment is a key process in determining future abundance of fish. Recruitment is however an inherently variable process, influenced by factors that regulate the supply of larvae from the ocean&nbsp;whilst&nbsp;post recruitment processes&nbsp;effect&nbsp;the survival of these recruits.&nbsp;This project involves collecting information on fish recruitment over large spatial and temporal scales to describe patterns in supply and the types of habitats favoured by different species. We then explore&nbsp;how&nbsp;large scale oceanic conditions (ENSO) influence supply of recruits and how availability of suitable recruit habitat effects survival of these young fish. The project is helping to identify essential nurserary habitats for fish and improve our ability to understand how populations of fish fluctuate through space&nbsp;and time.&nbsp;</p>"
