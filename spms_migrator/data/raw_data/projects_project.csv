This project includes five activities (two of which are exclusive to WA) that will contribute to addressing key knowledge gaps about the spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution, abundance, connectivity and health of dugong populations. The project is designed to inform management in several regions of high value habitat across northern Australia. Transversal to the activities described below is a strong partnership approach with Traditional Owners and members of the wider community. The project will be co-designed, co-produced and will co-deliver research and monitoring outputs. The studies will utilise and advance emerging technologies (e.g., aerial images collected from planes and drones, Artificial Intelligence, population genomics) with the ultimate goal of enhancing data quality, reducing research and monitoring costs, and increasing accessibility of monitoring tools to non-experts.</p>
<p>the five activiteis are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assessing trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery surveys along the eastern coast of Queensland</li>
<li>Assessing the trends in the distribution and abundance of dugongs during the transition to imagery survey in the Shark Bay and Ningaloo/Exmouth Gulf area</li>
<li>Using population genomics approaches to identify populations and their level of connectivity across northern Australia</li>
<li>Assessing the body size and body condition of dugongs using drone-based photogramme</li>
<li>Developing community-led dugong monitoring with traditional owners in the Kimberley region.</li>
</ol>
<p>Activities 2 and 5 are exclusive to WA and led by the Marine Science Program with collaborators in the respective regions and at JCU.&nbsp;</p>

This study examined habitat use in two woodland passerines (red-capped robin and golden whistler) on Rottnest Island, to determine the value of remnant and revegetated sites and hence inform future woodland restoration efforts for birds.These two bird species declined in abundance on Rottnest following fragmentation of woodland habitat. Red-capped robin abundance was greater in areas with taller trees and lower values for shrub layer cover, while golden whistler abundance was related positively to patch cover (i.e. a landscape variable). Total bird abundance was greater in areas with more shallow litter depths and lower patch cover. Robins spent equal amounts of time in open, edge and wooded areas, whereas whistlers spent about 75% of their time in woodland areas. Robins occur in patches with older trees, fewer shrubs, and with open/edge areas in which to forage. Golden whistlers prefer more extensive, continuous woodlands. Current revegetation could be subjected to silviultural treatment to provide a mix of such areas in order to optimise habitat for both species. Any future revegation aiming to provide whistler habitat should focus on extending the area of current patches, whereas robins will benefit from patchy plantings of taller trees.</p>",2012-02-01,2012-12-30,5,1,29,,,A Burbidge,,,,,A Burbidge,3,

<p><strong>Why?</strong> The foraging ground is the location that lipids are stored to fuel a reproductive migration.&nbsp; Sea turtles are capital breeders that have reproductive outputs and cycles based on stored energy.</p>
<p><strong>What have we found?</strong>&nbsp; The foraging ground distances to migrate (distance travelled) and remigration intervals (years between breeding) will strongly influence how the stored energy is spent on female reproductive output (number of annual nests).</p>

The main goals of this collaboration are to create a 3D digital specimen of a live flatback turtle that will be used for research, conservation and education purposes, and to organize hands-on talks that would teach colleagues the science and art of photogrammetry and explore the uses and benefits of novel 3D imaging techniques and the educational opportunities of 3D models of living animals.</p>
<p><strong>Why?&nbsp;</strong>One of the main objectives of the NWSFTCP's Strategic Conservation Plan is to establish information and education programs. Having access to a 3D digital specimen of a live flatback turtle offers&nbsp;opportunities for&nbsp;creating state-of-the-art communication and education material such as 3D printing, apps, educational computer games.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What have we found? </strong>Hands-on talks have been delivered in November 2017 in Perth by Professor Duncan Irschick. Duncan also came to Thevenard island to photograph nesting flatback turtles. A 3D digital specimen has now been created and is freely available for download here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://sketchfab.com/models/442372b7f02b4730882d41d959726156"">https://sketchfab.com/models/442372b7f02b4730882d41d959726156</a></p>
<p>This 3D model is now being used for augmented reality projects and for creating 3D prints of flatback turtles.</p>

The equivalent of a 'fitbit' for a turtle) are deployed on flatback turtles in order to collect the fine scale data on their diving behaviour and swimming performances at a foraging ground.</p>
<p><strong>Why?&nbsp;</strong>This PhD project aims to improve our understanding of flatback turtles using biologging tools (i.e. daily diaries and animal-borne video cameras) to analyse their fine-scale vertical and horizontal movements, providing the first quantitative insights of in-water behaviour at a recently discovered foraging ground. Jenna will elucidate the temporal and spatial drivers of behaviours that serve critical life history functions, such as foraging (important for energy gain) and rest (important for reducing energy expenditure). The anticipated outcome of this PhD project is to assess how flatback turtles might be impacted by anthropogenic disturbances at their foraging grounds.</p>

Stage 1 is to investigate the level of contamination and the potential residual impacts of radionuclides at Montebello Islands on turtles and researchers. Stage 2 will be developed if&nbsp;significant radionuclides are found.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong>&nbsp;Three nuclear tests were conducted at the Montebello Islands in the 1950s on two islands. Studies conducted in the 1990s suggested that soil plutonium concentrations were six and 10 times higher on Trimouille Island and Alpha Island respectively than after the clean up a Maralinga. Plutonium, uranium and other radionuclides are of interest as they remain at elevated concentrations, and some will persist for thousands of years. The degree to which actinides can accumulate in, and impact plants and animals, has both conservation (e.g. what are potential impacts to turtles nesting on contaminated Montebello beaches) and workplace safety implications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What have we found? </strong>Preliminary results indicate that residual contamination&nbsp;on the beaches is relative low compared to the dunes and inland parts of the islands. This is mainly due to the dynamic nature of the sediment on the beaches caused by waves, cyclones and nesting turtles. The calculated dose rates to turtles falls below the benchmark for harmful effects to wildlife.</p>

<p><strong>Why?&nbsp; </strong>Post-nesting satellite tracking studies of sea turtles over multiple years have revealed foraging &ldquo;hotspots&rdquo; or preferred habitat by flatback turtles. These areas appear to be stable inter-annually and are used by the turtles from different rookeries and also used by other species such as olive ridley and loggerhead turtles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This study&nbsp;used tracking data from various sources&nbsp;to identify foraging hotspots and to maximise resources from WAMSI Kimberley Node Benthic Project to extend benthic surveys into these areas. This will be the first dedicated study of flatback turtle foraging habitat.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong>What have we found?&nbsp;</strong></strong>The survey concentrated on the Lynher Bank, an offshore mid-shelf area&nbsp;north-west&nbsp; Cape Leveque.&nbsp; The faunal composition was dominated by non-scleractinian sessile organisms associated with soft bottom habitat with high water movement and low wave action.&nbsp; The lack of algae and the non-zooxanthallae corals was consistent with the low light benthic conditions.</p>

Finches benefited from recent fire but were disadvantaged in their breeding by frequent fire. Nutritional benefits were derived from recent fire, and low frequency fires, in terms of Sorghum seed nutrient concentrations, which forms the dominant food source for gouldian finches during the breeding season. Breeding years were most successful after years with multiple small fires rather than after years with a few large fires. Thois points to the benefits of a complex, fine grained fire mosaic for gouldian finch conservation to provide the greatest benefits to them in terms of breeding and feeding ecology.</p>",2014-07-01,2017-06-30,21,4,67,67,,I Radford,Kimberley,"East Kimberley, West Kimberley","Central Kimberley, Dampierland",Rangelands,I Radford,3,

<p><strong>Aims&nbsp;</strong>To determine the impacts of artificial light on nearshore movements of flatback hatchlings and identify cues used for navigation from field and laboratory experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance&nbsp;</strong>Light pollution is considered a primary risk to marine turtle populations and particularly on their early life-history stages. Although the negative impacts of artificial light on the orientation of marine turtle hatchlings from the nest to the sea has been well documented, the impact of artificial light on their in-water behaviour is poorly understood. This project will fill critical knowledge gaps that could be used for mitigation of impacts through advice&nbsp;on new developments or managing existing light in urban or industrial areas.</p>

Identifying the functional role of fish and understanding how they interact with other species is critical for the effective conservation and management of reef systems. Coral reef meso-predatory fish have been severely underrepresented in the scientific literature, with few studies providing the detail necessary to comprehensively appreciate the role this group plays in ecosystem food webs. Predators maintain and regulate ecosystem dynamics, although due to the exceedingly complex nature of marine food-webs, they can exhibit various functional roles whilst occupying different trophic levels. Meso-predatory species traditionally occupy trophic levels below top order consumers, although in coral reefs, meso-predators (e.g. Pseudochromis fuscus) have been identified predating from a range of sources. Consequently the function of predators and meso-predators in coral reef ecosystems are often not apparent, and can be difficult to distinguish and define. By expanding our understanding of the functional and trophic role of meso-predators on coral reefs, we can predict not only their response to external factors such as climate change and overfishing, but their contribution to trophodynamics and energy flow in the ecosystem. Using an integrated approach, we aim to investigate the abundance and biomass of several species of meso-predatory fish at Ningaloo Reef, combined with age determination to estimate secondary production of these fish.</p>",2013-06-18,2014-12-31,9,1,145,,,S Wilson,Pilbara,Exmouth,,,S Wilson,7,

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Information about anthropogenic pressures impacting the North West Shelf flatback turtle stock is limited and in particular there is no understanding of the cumulative impact of these human pressures on the stock. A comprehensive spatial and temporal overview of all human pressures impacting this stock is critical to inform the NWSFTCP's next strategic conservation plan and help prioritise areas requiring management, monitoring and/or protection&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What have we found?</strong> The cumulative risk assessment model&nbsp;has been built and maps are available. The different pressures impacting the stock have been identified and their impact has being assessed. High versus low impacted areas have been identified. Additional maps showing the vulnerability of flatback nesting sites to climate change: erosion, inundation and increased temperature, have also been built through Malindi Gammon's PhD work.&nbsp;</p>

Small and medium sized mammals are the group most threatened among Australian native fauna ever since European settlement of Australia. Recent decades have seen further declines among these threatened mammals in northern savanna regions including much of the Northern Terriotry including Kakadu. We are concerned that this trend does not continue into the North Kimberley which retains the most intact of the mammal assemblages left in mainland Australia. Management under this program has altered fires regimes and cattle impacts through prescribed burning and culling operations.

Northern quolls were once widely distributed from the Pilbara, Kimberley, across the Top End to southern Queensland, but have now contracted in distribution and density to several disjunct populations within their former range. In 2005, the northern quoll was listed as an Endangered species under the Commonwealth&rsquo;s <em>Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em>. This was due to an alarming decrease or complete collapse of some of the once locally abundant populations in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and a subsequent contraction of its range. In particular, northern quolls have declined at a rapid rate in association with the spread of the introduced cane toad <em>Rhinella marina</em>, which poisons quolls in their predation attempts. Several other ecological factors are contributing to the decline of quolls and other medium-sized mammal fauna, including predation by feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), wild dogs (<em>Canis lupus</em>), altered fire regimes, grazing and subsequent habitat modification by introduced herbivores, habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as the interactive effects between these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim to explore the hypothesis that northern quolls previously utilised more different habitat types in their movement and foraging activities, but predators (feral cats, foxes and dingoes, in conjunction with other threats such as grazing and fire) have restricted their occurrence to the most protected rocky habitat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Expected outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Occupancy modelling of the northern quoll in different habitats within the Pilbara bioregion</li>
<li>Occupancy models for predators, including feral cats, foxes and dingoes</li>
<li>An analysis of the relative roles of environmental variables (fire, geology, predator abundance) on northern quoll occupancy</li>
<li>A manipulation of these variables in scenario models to indicate which has the greatest likelihood of improving northern quoll population persistence</li>
<li>An understanding of what habitats are most important to northern quolls, and the contribution of lower-quality habitats (such as small rocky outcrops)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Strategic context (in relation to Corporate Plan and Business Plan):</strong></p>
<p>Building strategic partnerships is a key goal for the Science and Conservation Division, enabling us to address Western Australia&rsquo;s most pressing biodiversity conservation and natural resource management needs.&nbsp;Applied research into the interactions between threatened species and introduced predators is of key relevance to the Fauna Conservation Program. Ensuring the persistence of threatened species through local and landscape-scale management actions, including ameliorating key threats such as predation by foxes and feral cats, inappropriate fire regimes, competition and predation by introduced rodents on islands, assessing cane toad impacts and reconstructing the fauna of rangeland and arid areas, are major objectives of the program. This project will fulfil important goals of the Division, as well as address several aspects of the Key Research Priorities for the northern quoll, identified within Cramer <em>et al.,</em> (2016).</p>",2017-01-01,2020-12-31,5,1,80,80,,J Dunlop,Pilbara,Pilbara East,Pilbara,Rangelands,J Dunlop,1,

Published data suggests that the possums were failing to disperse across the property and were experiencing a genetic bottleneck. But wildlife cameras have captured images of possum breeding and regular movements of individuals along the ground which suggests that brushtail possums are actually present over approximately 100km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of the property.</p>
<p>Before we initiate further translocations of brushtail possums we need to corroborating or refuting conclusions of prior research.&nbsp;We propose using baited tracking tunnels with strips of velco as a non-invasive method of collecting scat and hair from possums with the aim of using modern fecal DNA and Restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq) techniques to assess population genetics. We will compare our samples to several preserved specimens held by the WA Museum.</p>
<p>Our questions are: 1) Can we collect viable genetic material from brushtail possums in the arid zone via baited tracking tunnels; 2) Is there on-going evidence of inbreeding or genetic bottlenecking in the brushtail possum population on Matuwa; and 3) Can we assess the phylogenetics of brushtail possums in the arid zone through fecal or hair DNA collected through non-invasive techniques?</p>",2021-04-09,2021-12-31,5,1,250,250,,C Lohr,Goldfields,Goldfields,Murchison,Rangelands,C Lohr,3,"<p>phylogenetics, detection, eDNA, threatened species, desert</p>"

Finally it trials aversion methods to see how effective they are on the movement patterns of red foxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong>&nbsp;Mundabullgana Station hosts one of the largest flatback rookeries in this the North West Shelf stock. Previous reports (Pendoley Pers. Comm.) state significant predation of eggs which was quantified by a camera trap study (King 2016). Managing foxes at this rookery is a priority and long-term efficient management will be informed by this study.</p>
<p><strong>What have we found? </strong>Ph.D. candidate John-Michael Stuart used satellite tracking to track 14 foxes on and adjacent to turtle nesting beaches. He found that foxes maintained and patrol very tight&nbsp; home ranges, they are highly depended on freshwater and utilise dens that are highly diverse in character.</p>

Intensive field work was conducted 1994-2000. Timber-harvesting occurred in 1995-1996. Pit and Elliott trapping for small vertebrates ceased in 2000. Cage trapping to monitor medium-sized mammals has continued on about 4-yearly intervals (i.e. 2004/05 and 2009). In so doing, responses to timber harvesting has been quantified 1-2 years pre-harvesting, 1-2 years during harvesting disturbance and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 13 years post disturbance. Spotlight surveys to monitor less readily captured mammals, particularly ngwayir and koomal, have been conducted along three transects since 1996 and were particularly intensive in 1997-2000. Since 2004 6 surveys per annum have been sustained on each of the three transects.</sub> <sub>This concept plan has been prepared to replace SPP 1993/115 and provide for completion of data analysis and publication of results for the period 1996 to 2011. This will be the immediate priority for work in 2012/13. Subject to confirmation that the experimental design is robust and can be extended, the study may be expanded to examine the response of vertebrates to harvesting of mature forest retained as exclusion strips during the 1996 operation. These strips are considered important in mediating the impact of timber harvesting on arboreal mammals and birds.

Another reason regrowth stands may need thinning is for wildfire risk mitigation, however, this needs to be quantified. A study published in May 2021 from the Black Summer bushfires found that forest plantations in NSW are extremely vulnerable to wildfire - they experienced extensive, high severity fire (70% suffered severe canopy damage) (Bowman et al. 2021).</p>
<p>One method of quantifying fire risk is to investigate the severity of fire that has already occurred at sites dominated by dense stems, sites with a range of harvest types, and associated control and old growth sites. Hundreds of fires (wildfires and prescribed burns) have occurred in the Northern Jarrah Forest in the last decades. These could be utilised together with remote sensing tools to examine how fire severity is influenced by forest stands which have a range of stand characteristics.</p>
<p>It is of benefit for us to understand the interaction between dense forest stands and the propensity for high fire severity. If dense stands are vulnerable to elevated fire severity, then we have a better understanding of the risks involved, and an evidence-based argument for some level of thinning to be undertaken to reduce fire severity and thus long-term damage to the forest.</p>

Through studying species that produce seeds that differ in size and germination biology, this project aims to: (1) determine the maximum shoot length that seeds can produce in the absence of any mechanical resistance; (2) quantify the maximum force exerted by emerging shoots in relation to growing conditions including temperature and soil properties; (3) through the Discrete Element Method model seedling emergence to tailor planting strategies to varying soil conditions, thereby optimising emergence conditions and increasing the chances of successful of plant recruitment.</p>",2023-01-04,2027-01-04,17,4,100525,100525,,D Merritt,Pilbara,Pilbara East,,,D Merritt,27,"<p>seed, plant recruitment, rehabilitation</p>"

<p>Functional trait profiles of savanna grass weeds (Competitor-Ruderal) compared to native tussock and hummock grasses (Stress tolerant), and also habitat disturbance preferences (roadsides, slashed areas, grading), suggest weeds are limited in Kimberley savannas by lack of suitable habitats. Grass weeds are similar and overlapping in their traits with some native forbs and legumes. Where weeds and native forbs or legumes increase, this indicates an increase in disturbance or plant resources in normally resource limited savannas.</p>
<p>This research suggests an answer to the question of why savannas and deserts are the least invaded of global biomes. Savannas and deserts are among the least suitable habitats for plants due to stressful conditions (e.g. lack of nutrients, lack of water, high heat or cold, etc). On the other hand most invaders are pre-adapted to high nutrient or high disturbance environments.</p>",2014-04-01,2018-07-12,21,1,67,67,,I Radford,Kimberley,"East Kimberley, West Kimberley","Victoria Bonaparte, Northern Kimberley, Ord Victoria Plain, Central Kimberley",Rangelands,I Radford,12,"<p>plant invasion, functional traits, global leaf economic spectrum, ruderal, competitor, specific leaf area</p>"

In older Australian terranes past hydrological systems are difficult to map and their connection with the ground surface complicated to characterise. This project employs a range of geophysical and geochemical methods across different settings to assess if these links occur, and if they are of benefit, or a threat to the biodiversity.

To restore divergent stands and alleviate moisture stress of riparian zones, pro-active management intervention via ecological thinning in a highly targeted and nuanced way has been proposed. Forest health is complex and interacts with direct (climate, management) and indirect (fire, pathogen) drivers.&nbsp;It is important to understand the forest responses to management actions such as forest thinning, including fuel loads and fire behaviour.&nbsp;</p>

However, the fire ecology of tree hollows has virtually not been studied in northern Australia. We suspect the drivers of tree hollow development and retention will be different to the ecology that has been well studied in southern Australia as savanna system experience different fire regimes and are subjected to additional processes such as cyclone events and termite activity. Tree hollows are an important ecological resource for around 40% of vertebrates in the Top End featuring mammals, reptiles, and birds. Developing optimal strategies for managing fire for arboreal mammals and thresholds of hollow abundance mediated by fire frequency and intensity will be a major advance for ecology and conservation.

It is also an important food source for the black swan and is thought to support diverse and productive faunal assemblages. However, much of the information about the value of this habitat is gleaned from Zostera species in estuaries elsewhere. Relatively little is known of the biodiversity and ecological value of Halophila ovalis, the dominant species in the Riverpark.&nbsp; <br />Macroalgae are commonly found in the lower reaches of the Riverpark in late spring and summer, and in recent years, large amounts of the macroalga Chaetomorpha linum have accumulated in response to favourable growth conditions. The macroalgae is fast-growing and is often considered a nuisance because it reduces light conditions to Halophila beds and can affect reproduction. This project is investigating the&nbsp;biodiversity and ecological values of Halophila meadows and Chaetomorpha accumulations. It will also determine the ecological value of accumulated wrack.</p>

In Australia, many digging mammals are threatened and their distributions have declined substantially. Because digging mammals are considered shapers of ecosystem structure and function, the loss of these species is perceived to have resulted in reduced ecosystem functionality. Reintroductions are a common practice used to improve the conservation status of digging mammals and should theoretically result in ecosystem restoration by returning lost ecosystem processes. However, at present we have little understanding of whether Australian digging mammals&rsquo; small-scale effects translate into landscape-scale changes and we do not know how reintroduced digging mammals will interact with degrading factors such as weeds.</p>
<p>My project aims to improve management of reintroduced populations of digging mammals through an increased understanding of their ecosystem interactions. Specifically, I aim to (1) review evidence for ecosystem restoration from existing reintroductions of digging mammals; (2) determine whether their small-scale effects translate to landscape-scale changes to soil and vegetation properties; (3) determine whether reintroduced digging mammals interact with weeds; and (4) determine the risk of spreading plant species during translocations of digging mammals.</p>",2018-07-24,2021-12-31,5,1,250,250,,C Lohr,Goldfields,Goldfields,,Rangelands,C Lohr,1,"<p>Threatened species, digging animals, ecosystem restoration, mammals, weeds</p>"

The decline is predominantly due to predation by introduced carnivores, and consequently, many threatened species are now being reintroduced into predator-free enclosures. An understanding of resource requirements and inter-specific competition is essential when undertaking reintroductions, especially for threatened species in fenced environments where dispersal and access to resources are limited. The burrowing bettong (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>), or boodie, and the rufous hare-wallaby (<em>Lagorchestes hirsutus</em>), or mala are both extinct in the wild on the Australian mainland and only occur on a few offshore predator-free islands and in several predator-free enclosures across Australia. Both species were reintroduced to an enclosure on the Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area in Western Australia. Co-existing populations of boodies and mala have not been studied, therefore, little is known about the ability of these species to co-exist in a fenced environment and how they partition resources. Both species are similar in size, they are omnivorous, nocturnal, and their native ranges overlapped across much of the arid zone.&nbsp;<br />The diet and the degree of dietary overlap between boodies and mala will be determined by performing DNA metabarcoding analyses on scats samples collected in the enclosure. The distribution of boodie and mala feeding activity across the enclosure will be estimated by plotting the locations of scats on a distribution map. A camera trap survey will be used to assess the feeding behaviour of boodies and mala and the intra and inter-species interactions occurring between the two species. Determining the dietary overlap, distribution of feeding activity and feeding behaviour and interactions occurring between the species will provide valuable information regarding the ability of boodies and mala to co-exist in a fenced environment for future management plans.</p>",2019-05-10,2020-07-31,5,4,250,250,,C Lohr,Goldfields,Goldfields,"Gascoyne, Murchison",Rangelands,C Lohr,1,<p>Bettongia leseuer; Lagorchestes rufous; Matuwa Indigenous Protected Area; TMPAC; Inter-species competition</p>

These complex results suugest that universal application of low intensity fires will not be optimal for all size classes of hollows and therefore all arboreal mammals. Rather this data suggests that fire regimes should be pyrodiverse and include both low and higher intensity fires, but that high intensity fires should be limited spatially so their negative impacts can be contained as well as their positive effects being promoted in some areas.</p>

These predator naive juveniles find themselves facing a predation gauntlet in a new environment. Exceedingly high predation during the first 48 hours post-settlement results in mortality rates greater than 60%. This predation 'bottleneck' imposes a limit on the number of new individuals able to join the adult population, impacting population structure, community composition, and their influence on ecosystem processes. Considering the important role of reef fishes in maintaining the health of coral reefs and supporting resilience, it is vital to understand what mediates post-settlement survival and explore new ways to enhance this process.</p>
<p>This project will design and test novel methods of enhancing survival of reef fishes at the critical early life stage and assess their feasibility within a restoration context.

Examination of these specimens has clarified a number of taxonomic and geographic distribution issues, and highlighted areas where further research is required. Conservation assessments of taxa have been made in conjunction with Species and Communities Branch personnel. Collaborations with Industry underpins this project as it was initially funded by Rio Tinto. Resolution of the taxonomy of this genus is held to be important as the accurate identification of species by environmental consultants (e.g. Biota, Western Botanical, ENV, ecologia etc.) is essential for the production of reports and the timely assessment of development proposals in the Pilbara and other areas of northern WA. Through their various consultants, BHP Billiton have also contributed numerous collections of <em>Tephrosia</em> from the Pilbara, especially from the Port Hedland area. This has enabled further assessment of the morphology, taxonomic status and distribution of the Priority listed taxon <em>T. rosea</em> var. Port Hedland (A.S. George 1114). Continuation and expansion of the project through receipt of an Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) grant to revise&nbsp;<em>Tephrosia&nbsp;</em>in WA and the NT involves external collaboration with taxonomists at the Northern Territory Herbarium and Queensland Herbarium, as well as researchers at the University of the Western Cape (South Africa).&nbsp;An interactive key to <em>Tephrosia</em>&nbsp;is likely to be widely used by Industry personnel and their contractors to identify species occurring in the Pilbara bioregion. This interactive key will also benefit DPaW and community environmental groups by permitting the identification of known species, and, by default, the recognition of putatively new taxa. Joint publications will be produced by staff within DBCA, as well as at other Australian herbaria and international institutions.</p>",,,6,4,155,139,139,T Macfarlane,"Kimberley, Pilbara",,"Victoria Bonaparte, Northern Kimberley, Ord Victoria Plain, Central Kimberley, Dampierland, Great Sandy Desert, Carnarvon, Little Sandy Desert, Gibson Desert, Gascoyne, Central Ranges",Rangelands,T Macfarlane,4,"<p><em>Tephrosia</em>, Fabaceae, taxonomy, herbarium, eFlora, conservation</p>"

We need to estimate baseline condition levels in terms of sand temperature at nesting aggregations within the NWS flatback turtle management unit.</p>

<p><strong>Why?&nbsp;</strong>Light pollution is considered a primary risk to marine turtle populations and particularly on their early life-history stages. Although the negative impacts of artificial light on the orientation of marine turtle hatchlings from the nest to the sea has been well documented, the impact of artificial light on their in water behaviour is poorly understood. This project will fill critical knowledge gaps that could be used for mitigation of impacts through advice to new developments or managing existing light in urban or industrial areas.</p>
<p><strong>What have we found? </strong>PhD candidate is still in the final stages of this project and all analyses are not completed. However, preliminary results show that hatchling flatback turtles are attracted to light at sea, there is a complex interaction between wave direction and light that influences turtle orientation. Coastal structures such as jetties also influence the level of hatchling predation adjacent to rookeries.</p>

The project has confirmed that cats can cause local extinction pof mammals. It has also shown how cats use recently burnt areas preferentially for hunting, and how this leads to greatly increased predation rates on resident small mammals. Cats are at much lower occupancy in areas with high vegetation cover and in rocky terrain. Fire regimes should aim to increase vegetation cover or fire patchiness so that bare ground is reduced. Threatened mammals were shown to use resources (e.g. consistently fruiting trees and large eucalypts with developed tree hollows) which can only be maintained under low intensity, patchy fire regimes.</p>",2010-01-01,2014-12-31,7,6,67,67,,I Radford,,,,,I Radford,1,

<p><strong>What have we found?&nbsp;</strong>An aerial survey around Thevenard Island and along the coast near Onslow was run in October and November 2017 to spot flatback turtle mating pairs. One mating pair was spotted during the survey. Another mating pair was spotted from land in the waters of Thevenard island.

All sandy beaches of islands and mainland from Cape Keraudren westward including Tent Island in the Exmouth Gulf were surveyed in order to determine the number of turtle tracks of each species along this section of the Pilbara coastline.</p>
<p><strong>Why?&nbsp;</strong>This project fulfills two goals of the NWSFTCP's Strategic Conservation Plan: to produce an inventory of turtle nesting locations and seasonality (spatial and temporal distribution) and to test new research methodologies, including aerial survey, that will improve monitoring efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>What have we found? </strong>This aerial survey revealed that flatback turtles nest on the majority of the Pilbara islands, including some islands in the Exmouth Gulf. A map of presence and absence of turtle activity has been produced in addition to a map of turtle track density.&nbsp;</p>

The equivalent of a 'fitbit' for a turtle) are deployed on flatback turtles in order to collect the first fine scale data on their diving behaviour and swimming performances.</p>
<p><strong>Why?&nbsp;</strong>No fine scale data on diving behaviour and swimming performances exist for flatback turtles. This is surprising considering that over 200 papers are available for all other species of turtles and their diving behaviour, swimming speeds, etc, have been studied in detail. An understanding of the diving behaviour and swimming performances of free-ranging flatback turtles is critical to understand their basic at-sea ecology and biology and in turn mitigate the impact of anthropogenic threats such as lights, dredging, and oil spill on this species.</p>
<p><strong>What have we found? </strong>Daily Diaries have been deployed on ten flatback turtles, both male and female, in the inter-nesting and foraging areas. The loggers collected weeks worth of data that are currently being analysed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Establish improved accumulation models for fuel strata in southwest jarrah forests against time since fire, fire severity and jarrah forest type;</li>
<li>Assess fuel treatment effectiveness of current mitigation methods using new methods, tools and knowledge</li>
<li>Determine effectiveness of fine-scale burn mosaic (Soft Edge Mosaic) application to reduce fuel hazard;</li>
<li>Improve field-based assessment methods for fuel characterisation based on Version 1 of Vesta Field Guide;</li>
<li>Develop and determine accuracy of lidar/satellite/point cloud based methods for assessment of fuel characteristics;</li>
<li>Improve understanding of key drivers of woody fuel consumption and the linkages with carbon accounting, smoke plume development and emissions;</li>
<li>Improve spatial mapping of fuel characteristics and classification through application of the Bushfire Fuel Classification; and</li>
<li>Develop a Digital Fire Behaviour Database to represent recent and historical case studies to learn from, inform and evaluate predictive tools.</li>

Water quality is a Key Performance Indicator in the marine park management plan and is considered one of the primary factors underlying benthic habitat condition. Sporadic water quality assessments in Roebuck Bay have indicated that nutrient levels at some locations breach ANZECC and AMRCANZ guidelines. Consequently, DBCA and Yawuru Joint Management partners have identified water quality as the highest priority for monitoring and applied research due to its linkages with other ecological values. Pressures associated with urban development around the Broome township and agricultural activities within the Roebuck Plains catchment are of increasing concern to the park&rsquo;s ecological values, but these sources originate outside the marine park and require collaboration with neighboring land-users to implement appropriate monitoring and management strategies.</p>
<p>This project will address a critical knowledge gap in understanding nutrient loads entering Roebuck Bay from the Roebuck Plains pastoral station, which have not previously been measured. Nutrient loads will be assessed in water samples collected from major seasonal water courses across Roebuck Plains throughout the wet season to estimate water quality pressure on the Yawuru Nagulagun Roebuck Bay Marine Park.</p>",2022-12-01,2023-09-08,9,1,100984,100984,,K Crook,Kimberley,West Kimberley,"Dampierland, Canning",Rangelands,K Crook,7,"<p>Roebuck Bay, Water Quality, Broome, Pastoral Station, Cattle, Nutrients, Wetland</p>"

However, live capture can be disruptive and poses the risk of death, stress and injury to animals during trapping sessions. DNA-based approaches, for example, genetic analysis of non-invasively collected samples such as scats or hair, offers a suitable alternative approach to capture-recapture monitoring. We aim to develop a SNP-based genetic monitoring method for application to Barrow Island boodies (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>). Performance of a DNA-based methodology will be compared to existing data from live capture survey to estimate the current population size.</p>",2022-10-01,2023-12-31,5,4,241,241,,"K Ottewell, R Shaw",Pilbara,,,,K Ottewell,1,

<p><strong>Why?&nbsp; </strong>Spatial understanding of turtles during all life stages is important for managers to understand how potential pressures may impact the population.&nbsp;This information assists spatial planning for marine parks and reserves and also informs fisheries and other resource users.</p>
<p><strong>What have we found?&nbsp; </strong>Four species (flatback, green, hawksbill, loggerhead turtles) have globally significant nesting numbers and foraging habitats across the Kimberley, Pilbara and Gascoyne. Olive ridley turtles are sparse nesting on marginal ranges in the Kimberley, and leatherback turtles are not nesting but have migratory corridors through WA waters. Data are collected and/or collated from different sorces to infrom our understading of the movements and important habitats for these species. This is an ongoing project with regular publications from our team and collaborators.<strong><br /></strong></p>

Photo credit Judy Dunlop.</p>","<p>The burrowing bettong or boodie (<em>Bettongia lesueur</em>) is a burrowing species of rat-kangaroo in the family Potoroidae.&nbsp;The boodie was once widespread across much of mainland Australia, however, since European settlement the species has undergone drastic declines in distribution and was believed extinct on the mainland in the 1960&rsquo;s.&nbsp;Several threatening processes still occur for the boodie, with one long standing hypothesis being their decline was attributed to competition for food resources with introduced herbivores, such as the European rabbit.&nbsp;In response to heavy predation on reintroduced mammals at Matuwa, an 1100ha enclosure was constructed in 2009. Boodies were translocated into the enclosure in 2010 from populations on Barrow Island as well as the Return to Dryandra Woodland enclosure. Research into the boodie population within the enclosure indicated one that was thriving, with good survival and reproduction.&nbsp;A translocation of boodies in late 2010 to an area outside of the predator-proof enclosure however was unsuccessful due to predation from wild dogs.&nbsp; A&nbsp;second attempted wild translocation is now planned for 2018, pending sufficient predator control.</p>
<p>In preparation for this translocation we are interested in investigating some characteristics of the resident population to help inform planning for the proposed translocation, and to establish baselines against which to assess the translocated population&rsquo;s behaviour, habitat use and diet responses. The following research questions will be addressed in this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the current body condition of the resident boodies?
<ul>
<li>Cage trapping minimum of 2 trips per year - Weighing and measuring boodies, assessing &ldquo;body condition&rdquo; through the amount of fat present along vertebrae and pelvis as per Moseby &amp; O&rsquo;Donnell (2003)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the current diet of the resident boodie population? Are there any dietary preferences and seasonal fluctuations (e.g. heavily favouring seeds or a specific species of flora over fungi)?
<ul>
<li>Collection of scats (aimed to collect 3 to 4 times per year, with a minimum of 2 sampling trips per year)</li>
<li>Collection and preparation of reference samples of vegetation, seed, fungi and invertebrates, and assess food resource availability at proposed release sites</li>
<li>Proportional Similarity Index (PSI) for data analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a significant difference in the diet of the resident boodie population post-release?</li>
<li>Is there a significant difference in body condition post-release?</li>
<li>What is the current habitat use within the enclosed area and are there any clear preferences of habitat utilisation (e.g. for foraging/resting/warren placement) in regards to flora species present? Are there similar ratios of floral species outside of the fenced reserve in comparison to within?</li>

Annual Sorghum grass seeds at sites burnt in the previous year had higher nutritional value that unburnt sites, but high fire frequency reduced nutritional value of seeds. This suggests that optimal fire management for threatened finches would include application of multiple fires during early dry season and wet season, and protection from high intensity fires which reduces patchiness and increases frequency of fire.</p>",2013-01-01,2017-12-31,7,6,67,67,,I Radford,Kimberley,East Kimberley,"Ord Victoria Plain, Kimberley",Rangelands,I Radford,3,

The first component to this research project is to establish a health and disease baseline for turtle species in Western Australia (WA), including establishing baseline blood chemistry reference ranges. Secondly it will assess the causes of morbidity and mortality of marine turtles in Western Australia, including assessing Spirorchiid (blood fluke) infection&nbsp;as a significant cause of mortality for all marine turtle species in WA.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>&nbsp;In Western Australia there have been no scientific studies to assess causes of mortality and disease in marine turtle species at a regional scale. The results from these studies provide essential information on pressures that impact individual stocks in the region and provide avenues for direct management action.</p>
<p><strong>What have we found?&nbsp;</strong>This project is still underway. Most field work is now completed with over 80 necropsies performed and over 200 samples of blood collected from a combination of nesting and foraging flatback turtles.</p>

In Western Australia&rsquo;s Wheatbelt, the subspecies survives in only seven very isolated and fragmented populations of less than 150 individuals in each population. These populations are considered genetically important for the persistence of the species. Fragmentation and small population size result in increased risk of local extinctions due to stochastic events such as drought. The likelihood of recolonisation of these habitats decreases as the distance from relict populations increases. In recent years, genetic techniques have highlighted the impact that fragmented habitat has historically had in shaping the distribution of this subspecies.</p>
<p>The purpose of the project is to develop a population management plan for the Wheatbelt black-flanked rock wallaby populations. The Rock Wallaby Recovery Plan identifies the high priority of needing to undertake translocations and supplementations at the isolated Wheatbelt populations to maintain genetic diversity and prevent overpopulation at fenced populations. This complex set of exchanges between populations needs a plan to ensure genetic management is undertaken correctly and in line with available genetic information.</p>",2023-02-07,2024-12-31,5,1,251,251,,"L Povh, K Ottewell, K Nilsson, M Dziminski, A Raycraft","Kimberley, Pilbara, Midwest, Goldfields, Wheatbelt, Swan, South Coast",,,,M Dziminski,1,"<p>Rock Wallaby, management plan, translocation, threatened species, wheatbelt, Western Australia, granite rock outcrop</p>"

The overall project is a collaborative effort between CSIRO (Matt Vanderklift), DEC (Tom Holmes) and DoF (Claire Smallwood), and will support the continued development of the Western Australian Marine Monitoring Program's (WAMMP) MER monitoring program. Fish communities are listed as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in all of Western Australia's marine parks, and as such are an important focus of the WAMMP's statewide monitoring program. While much of the monitoring focus commonly lays in shallower water areas accessible to methods utilsing in-water SCUBA divers, there is an acknowledgement that surveys of deeper water assemblages, beyond the limits of safe/feasible diving operations, must also be incorporated into any comprehensive program. Baited Remote Underwater stereo-Video (stereo-BRUV) has previously been utilised as a part of WAMMP's fish community monitoring program in other regions and is an effective way of surveying in deeper waters, beyond the reach of conventional diver based methods. The proposed study will extend the use of this method into the Ningaloo Marine Park, in deeper waters (50-70m) outside of the lagoonal area. The project aims can be split into primary and secondary objectives. Primary Objectives: a) determine the appropriateness and required spatial design (including levels of replication) that would be sufficient for on-going deep water fish community monitoring under WAMMP . b) provide WAMMP and DEC with a current ""baseline"" of the condition of fish communities (Max <em>N, _size frequency) in deeper waters of the Ningaloo marine park (beyond the reef crest); c) determine how fish community condition currently differs between protected (Sanctuary and Special Purpose zones beyond the reef crest) and non-protected areas in the deeper waters of the Ningaloo marine park; and d) align measures of fish community condition with metrics of recreational fishing pressure (spatial/temporal fishing effort, fishing gear, targeted species), obtained by DoF as a separate component of the Caring for our Country project. Secondary Objectives a) align CSIRO activity (_Caring for our Country</em> and <em>Gorgon Net Conservation Benefits</em> projects) with metrics and methods and sampling designs which are of use for MPA management; and b) train DEC staff in deployment and analysis of BRUVs, which are a listed method for sampling fish community condition under WAMMP (Max <em>N</em>, size frequency).</p>",2013-01-01,,9,4,156,,,T Holmes,,,,,T Holmes,7,

High rates of predation (&gt; 80%) have occurred at both sites despite regular baiting with Probait. &nbsp; Western Shield data from sites baited with Dried Meat Baits (DMB) pre 2000 clearly show recovery of fauna populations and therefore suggest that baiting with DMB was initially effective in controlling foxes. However, since 2000 there have been significant and widespread declines in fauna populations (this is pre Probait deployment). &nbsp;This suggests that the problem of reduced efficacy is more complex than just bait type and poses several questions. &nbsp;How effective is the current baiting regime in controlling foxes? Is there a difference in attractiveness and uptake between Probait and DMBs? &nbsp;Is there a difference between na&iuml;ve fox populations and populations exposed to extended baiting regimes? &nbsp;If there is a difference, can bait uptake be improved by presenting novel bait types? &nbsp; Field trials will be undertaken to measure the efficacy of the current baiting regime using Probait verses DMB and to test for differences in efficacy on bait aware and na&iuml;ve fox populations. &nbsp;The trials will be undertaken in Kalbarri National Park (currently fox baited) and Murchison House (MH) pastoral lease (unbaited for foxes).&nbsp; MH will be baited with Probait and Kalbarri will be divided into two areas so that one area can be baited with Probait and the other with DMB. &nbsp; The trials in Kalbarri and MH will involve: &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Radio-collaring 10 foxes per site (total of 30 foxes) to monitor survival through the designated baiting program. &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application of aerial baiting in winter to all three sites. &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishment and monitoring of four 10km transects of sand plots in each site pre-and post-baiting to measure the changes in fox activity. &nbsp; An investigation of fox movement and landscape use in relation to bait application will be undertaken in Cape Range National Park. &nbsp;At this location, ten foxes will be fitted with GPS radio collars for this purpose. An aerial baiting program using navigational and bait dispensing equipment to record bait drops will be undertaken so that this data can be compared with the location/movement data from the GPS collars. &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expected outcome: &nbsp; This trial will: &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establish if the current Western Shield baiting regime is still effective in controlling a population of foxes that have been exposed to the long term use of Probait. &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine if Probait is more effective in controlling a bait na&iuml;ve population of foxes than a Probait aware population. &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine if Probait or the DMB is more effective in controlling a Probait aware population of foxes. &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the above findings, investigate if a novel bait is more effective in controlling a Probait aware population of foxes. &nbsp; &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spatially monitor fox movement in a fragmented landscape to determine if aerial deployment of Probaits is effective in controlling foxes. &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proposed period of the project: &nbsp;April 2011 to October 2011. &nbsp;</p>",,,5,1,116,,,N Thomas,,,,,N Thomas,3,

Research will be directed toward understanding biology, population dynamics, forest impacts, the influence of departmental management regimes on such populations and the potential for the implementation of adaptive management strategies to ameliorate/understand outbreak events on DEC estate. This project will be developed in the context to the commitment made in the Forest Management Plan (FMP) 2004-13 to develop a forest health surveillance system, and will extend into the period of the next FMP. This project is designed to augment forest health surveillance and management requirements by providing knowledge on the biological aspects of forest health threats for an invertebrate as briefly outlined below: 1. Investigate aspects of pest organism biology, host requirements, pathology and environmental conditions (including climatic conditions) which influence populations 2. Determine distribution of the invertebrate pests including outbreak boundaries, and advancing outbreak fronts, using aerial mapping, remote sensing and road surveys 3. Measure relative abundance of the invertebrate pest including quantitative population surveys and host/environmental impact studies where appropriate and/or possible 4. Application of appropriate technologies including GIS and remote sensing 5. Population modelling techniques for the purpose of predictive outbreak scenarios These processes have been, and are currently, applied to known invertebrate forest pests for the south-west WA, including jarrah leaf miner (JLM), bulls-eye borer, gumleaf skeletonizer (GLS), and brown banded basket lerp. Individual pest species have attributes that are specific to their biology and extent of prior knowledge on the species, and therefore not all of the above elements can be equally applied for each organism. However the above list outlines a general process of investigation for such organisms. At present the project will formalise the work being conducted on GLS and JLM, but in the future could incorporate new emergent pests such as Helena gum moth and introduced psyllids. 2. Expected outcome: Knowledge of the behaviour, extent and impact of invertebrate forest pests will provide a sound understanding of outbreak dynamics and facilitate the development of management strategies. 3.

The project is seen as (Tony Peacock, IA CRC CEO): ""CALM is a pioneer in controlling introduced predators, particularly with its <em>Western Shield</em> program. The 'demonstration site' is the largest single venture funded by the IA CRC, with equal funding from CALM. It is being run in partnership with Australia's biggest private provider of wildlife sanctuaries, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, and supported by Worsley Alumina Pty Ltd and ALCOA World Alumina Australia. ""You are ahead of the country in terms of fox control, so cats have become a much bigger problem,"" Tony said. ""While the rest of Australia is catching up with fox control, CALM is a pioneer in the cat control field. ""CALM is regarded as a world leader in that regard. In the rest of the country, feral cats are in the 'too hard' basket but WA has had to take them out of the 'too hard' basket and deal with them,"" he said. ""There is already a huge national and international interest&hellip; New Zealand is watching, and cats are also a big problem in the United States and Pacific Islands."" The IA CRC's purpose is to counteract the impact of invasive animals using new technologies, and to integrate approaches across agencies and jurisdictions. Tony said he hoped to create a <em>Team Australia</em> approach so that scientists from all states and departments could form partnerships to bring in new techniques outside their normal operating environments. Collaboration builds on existing working relationships with Murdoch University. This has enabled the python PhD program (Gillian Bryant) to be extended to the jarrah forest and will allow comparisons of south-west carpet python ecology and response to fox control between small localised areas baited for fox control with large areas.

Application to freshwater environments in Western Australia has been limited. This project aims to develop passive eDNA sampling methods for biodiversity assessments of river systems that will ultimately build capability within DBCA for large-scale application using methods for which limited expertise or training is required. The research will incorporate two components: 1) an experiment to trace artificial DNA through a river network using passive sampling methods; and 2) the application of passive eDNA sampling methods to a river network seasonally to produce a full biodiversity assessment of the aquatic fauna community, with inferences on the distribution of key species detected in the system.</p>",2022-03-01,2025-11-30,7,1,100859,100859,,"J Hyde, G McGrath","Swan, South West","Swan Coastal, Perth Hills",Swan Coastal Plain,Swan,"J Hyde, G McGrath",32,"<p>aquatic eDNA, passive sampling, freshwater biodiversity, fish, frogs, invasive species</p>"
